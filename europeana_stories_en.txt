Moving towards digital

The Pescia Paper Museum (Museo della Carta di Pescia) has its historical headquarters in the ancient 'Le Carte' paper mill built around the beginning of the 18th century. The paper factory represents how paper was typically manufactured since the Middle Ages.

It was centrally located in the 'paper district' of the Pescia river. Tools and machinery used in paper production are still preserved inside the factory.  Watermarked paper produced by 'Le Carte' had the historical reputation of being some of the most high-quality paper until the 18th Century.

Since 2008 the museum has worked extensively on recovering and preserving its collections, which include all the traditional tools used in the hand production of paper: watermarked moulds, waxes, stamps, watermarked metallic cloths and watermarked sheets. The museum was the first to catalogue paper goods in Italy and today is the national 'reference model' for this peculiar type of heritage.

Explore some of the modern art pieces and prints from Museo della Carta di Pescia's collections throughout this story.

This art piece by Eva Marisaldi aims to highlight the importance of paper and recycling. The piece is currently on display at the Museo della Carta di Pescia.

Important documents from the paper-making company located in the paper mill were donated to the Pescia Paper Museum in 2004.

These documents make up the 'Magnani Historical Archive', over 600 metres of documentation, now located in the first restored wing of the new site of the museum. This wing of the museum was opened in 2016. The Magnani archive is currently being digitised and catalogued. The archive is an important asset to be made available for researchers, allowing not only to safeguard and preserve such heritage for posterity, but also to deepen the research on the history of paper in the Pescia valley.

The museum also aims to actively maintain the immaterial heritage of paper-making by restoring the tradition of watermarked hand-made paper production. In 2018, the newly-founded company 'Impresa Sociale Magnani Pescia' resumed production of handmade watermarked paper and paper products, in collaboration with the museum. The restoration of these techniques has generated new job opportunities in a factory whose roots in the Pescia area date back to the 15th century.

Arcangelo Sassolino placed this sheet of paper on the ground and passed over it with a forklift. This work contrasts the violent crushing forklift action with the fragile, thin sheet of paper.

Paper production has been characteristic for the Tuscany area for centuries, making the region a prime destination for cultural tourists interested in learning about the history of paper production.

In the 'La Via della Carta in Toscana' project, the Pescia paper museum participated in creating inter-province tourist experiences in and focused on the tradition of the paper industry.

Tuscany is still a hub for paper production. More than 360 companies are located in the paper district in Capannori, forming the most important paper production hub in Europe.

So the old paper factory 'Le Carte' contains more than meets the eye: it's a museum, a historical building, an archive of documents and machinery and tools, and a functioning factory housing a commercial company.

The Pescia Paper Museum is part of the UNESCO project 'Paper Mills of Europe - From the era of hand-made paper'. The project comprises a selected group of six paper mills in five countries (Germany, Czech Republic, Italy, Poland and Spain) that demonstrates a leading role in the handmade paper industry from the 16th centuries onwards. The project partners cover the key pre-industrial European paper producing regions: the Iberian Peninsula and the Apennine Peninsula. Paper production spread from these centres throughout Europe.

Richard Guarneri has created a composition of incomprehensible handwriting and luminous variations of coloured areas, supported by the starkly white paper sheet.

In the context of the EUreka3D project, the museum embarked on the creation of an ambitious new workflow to start digitising its collections in 3D.

The museum has shared 3D models of two different watermarked moulds to Europeana:  the first one with images of Napoleon and Marie Louise crafted in 1812, and the second with an ex libris by Ettore Serra used to produce handmade paper for the first edition of Giuseppe Ungaretti'sIl porto sepoltoin 1923.

Through the wiring of this paper mould you can see the ex libris of Ettore Serra that would be watermarked on pages made with this mould. At the bottom the initials 'E' and 'S' are found.

The faces of Emperor Napoleon and Empress Marie Louise of Austria face each other in profile in the watermark of this paper mould. Their names are written in the circles around their heads.

Digitising watermarked moulds is particularly challenging. This is the first time 3D models have been made of this type of heritage. The moulds are complex structures made of different materials: bronze, wood, and copper. They're also very fragile.

Digitising these two moulds and making them accessible on Europeana through the EUreka3D project has been an important test bed for the new 3D digitisation and preservation workflow of the museum.

Now you can see these moulds in detail for yourself in high-quality 3D. Thousands of documents from the Magnani Historical Archives will also become available on Europeana, focusing on the correspondence between Magnani and its worldwide customers, and other artworks and oeuvres on paper in the museum’s collections.

This blog is part of theEUreka3D project, which aims to build the capacity of small cultural heritage institutions in digital transformation, particularly on issues related to 3D digitisation.

What is laughter exactly?

Is laughter just a human thing?

When did humans start to laugh?

What is the world’s oldest joke?

Is laughter really the best medicine?

We learn to laugh before we speak or walk. Sharing a joke brings people together, creates friendships, and helps us to cope with even the bleakest of times. But what exactly is going on when we laugh?

Laughter is a non-verbal vocalisation that is a response to something in our environment, or to a thought or memory. It can express that we find something funny, or that we are relieved, or sometimes that we’re scared or nervous.

Laughter starts in our limbic system - which means that laughing is involuntary, we don’t choose to laugh. When the limbic system gets a message from the part of our brain that decodes visual and auditory information (the frontal lobe) telling it we need to laugh, the limbic system then sends out a message. This sets a physical process going, and gives our diaphragm, intercostal muscles and 15 facial muscles a good workout.

Research suggests that laughter is not just for humans.

Charles Darwin himself noticed how pet dogs tease their owners. Apes engage in social play and tickle each other. Apparently even rats laugh!

Because we see laughter occurring in other animals, it’s likely that it had an evolutionary role for us. At some point in history, laughter might have helped us to survive.

The evolution of laughter could be linked to the survival of the group - the ability to make people feel at ease and part of a community made a group stronger and contributed to its success.

There are two types of laughter - neurologically speaking. The first is Duchenne laughter, which is an emotional response to stimuli that we see starting with preverbal babies. It is thought that Duchenne laughter became a kind of social glue in our human ancestors between four and two million years ago.

The second is non-Duchenne laughter, which is more voluntary and is controlled by a different part of the brain. This kind of laughter appeared when humans developed more sophisticated cognitive abilities. These two kinds of laughter have distinctly different processes in the brain.

Jokes require quite complex cognitive processes. We need to be able to understand and picture other people’s perspectives, be able to predict other people’s reactions, and play with those expectations. And we often have to understand many things that are un-said to do with social rules, norms and language so we understand when a joke violates them.

For the purposes of discovering the oldest joke in the world, a joke is defined as having a clear set-up and punchline structure.

The Guinness World Record for the world’s oldest joke goes to a Sumerian proverb dating from 1900 BCE and it’s the kind of thing kids today would still find funny - it’s a fart joke.

Sumerian is one of the world’s oldest languages. It’s from ancient Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq). The joke was found on a tablet from the Old Babylonian period and may date back as far as 2,300 BCE.

Something which has never occurred since time immemorial; a young woman did not fart in her husband's lap.

The ancient Greek philosophers thought that laughing at others or at earlier versions of ourselves served to make us feel superior.

Freud theorised that laughter was used as a release for pent-up nervous energy, which led to a later theory to do with the resolution of incongruity, meaning that ultimately, we laugh because we have seen something in a new light.

Laughing increases our oxygen intake and releases endorphins, which can create the effect of easing pain. It can also lower adrenaline and cortisol levels, which reduces our feeling of stress, and floods our bloodstream with feel-good dopamine and oxytocin.

By strengthening our brain’s neural connections, it can also improve our mood.

That’s not all. Laughing can be credited with helping us lose weight, well, a very tiny bit of weight - laughing for 10-15 minutes can burn up to 40 calories. Some studies show that people who have just been laughing can withstand 15% more pain, and there are all sorts of laughter therapies available.

So, it might not be the best medicine definitively, but it’s certainly beneficial!

Who was Saint Michael?

Is there a ley line connecting places of worship dedicated to Saint Michael?

Many places across Europe are dedicated to Saint Michael.

Saint Michael is the patron of many countries, cities, and people such as rescuers, skydivers, the deceased, and more. He is also a figure in many different religions, such as Catholicism, Orthodoxism, Protestantism, Islam, and Judaism.

In Christian culture, Saint Michael is often portrayed while holding a libra, a symbol of peace and balance, and a sword, which represents the power of changing and liberation, but also the ability to tell good from evil.

A recent 'ley lines' theory supposes that the Earth is crossed by 'spiritual' lines, which have religious significance and are bearers of supernatural energy.  These ley lines are said to connect many shrines that are dedicated to Saint Michael - their alignment is  not coincidental, but rather a divine scheme laid out by supernatural forces.

Despite its increasing popularity, this theory is considered pseudoscientific, and is not confirmed by any reliable source since no scientific evidence indicates that the alignment was planned and meaningful.

Connecting shrines to Saint Michael across Europe, the line drawn is in the shape of a sword. In this blog, we'll explore seven sites that could be said to be connected by Saint Michael's blade.

Skellig Michael is twin-pinnacled crag situated in the sea in the southwest of Ireland.

Cell A, Skellig MichaelbyThe Discovery ProgrammeonSketchfab

The Gaelic Christian Monastery dedicated to Saint Michael was founded between the 6th and 8th centuries, and was inhabited until the late 12th or early 13th century despite its inhospitable location and difficult terrain. The monastery includes cells, a graveyard, an oratory, and a church dedicated to Saint Michael, which dates to the 10th or early 11th century.

Today, the church has collapsed for the most part. In the 1920s, two lighthouses were built on the Atlantic side of the island. The church now contains a grave for members of the family of one of the lighthouse keepers.

St Michael's Mount is a tidal island in Cornwall, England. Historically, it is the English counterpart of Mont-Saint-Michel in Normandy which is also a tidal island, with a similar conical shape.

The Chapel of St. Michael dates back to 1135 and was rebuilt in the 15th century. An old tale says that the Archangel Michael appeared before local fishermen on the mount in the 5th century. The Chapel is still open today, and now serves the Order of St John.

In the early 18th century, St Michael's Mount became an important seaport. By the 19th century, the population peaked and a community formed lasting until 1852, when the improvements to nearby Penzance harbour marked the decline of the village and many of the buildings were demolished.

Today it’s possible to visit the island, including the chapel, underground railway and  fortified castle, home to the home of the St Aubyn family since the 1600s, where many historic objects have been preserved such as a Samurai armour, a statue of St Michael offering mercy to the Devil at his feet, a mummified cat, and more.

Mont Saint-Michel in northern France is the tidal island that twins St Michael's Mount in Cornwall. The bay in which the islet rises with its tides makes it the most popular tourist site in Normandy, and one of the first in the whole of France.

According to the legend, the archangel Michael appeared to Saint Aubert, bishop of Avranches, in 709 requesting a church to be built for him on the island. However, the bishop ignored the request until Saint Michael burned a hole into the bishop's skull with his finger. The bishop survived and then set about building the church. The skull of Saint Aubert with the hole is now preserved in the cathedral of Avranches, Normandy.

Mont Saint-Michel is one of the three most famous worship places dedicated to Saint Michael, and is one of the most popular Christian pilgrimage destinations in Europe.

The Sacra di San Michele stands in the Susa Valley region in northern Italy. Due to its elevated position, the site has historically hosted fortifications by the various populations that inhabited the area.

Around the year 900, Count Hugh of Montboissier went on a pilgrimage to Rome to seek indulgence from the Pope. The Pope gave him a choice to atone for his sins: either to go into exile for seven years or to build an abbey. Thus, between 983 and 987, he built the Sacra di San Michele  which was  then inhabited by Benedictine monks.

After six centuries of monastic life, the Sacra was then abandoned for about two hundred years until 1836, when King Charles Albert of Savoy initiated its restoration, reviving its former glory. Today, the Sacra houses 16 sarcophagi containing the remains of members of the House of Savoy, each weighing 5 tons. The site is currently undergoing preservation and restoration efforts.

This site in southern Italy has been venerated since the year 490.

It was built above the grotto where, according to legend, Saint Michael first appeared in the region. From the 7th century onwards, the area came under Lombard rule. The cult of Saint Michael developed here in a context of archaic religion and Norse influence, attributing to the Archangel Michael war-like characteristics similar to those associated with Odin, the Germanic god of war, guide to the afterlife, and protector of men and warriors.

The sanctuary consists of the natural grotto and a complex of various constructions built by different populations over the centuries. It is a popular site for both religious pilgrims and tourists.

On the island of Symi, a monastery stands in front of a white sand beach, with a baroque tower that is visible from the sea. The exact date of its construction is unknown, but it was probably built around 450 AD on the site of a former temple of Apollo. Over time, the structure has been altered and expanded. The exterior has been re-styled with Venetian influence, and a tower was added in 1911.

This Greek Orthodox monastery is dedicated to Saint Michael of Panormitis, who is the patron of the island as well as the protector of sailors throughout the Dodecanese.

Inside the monastery, there is an icon of Saint Michael, which is believed to be miraculous. According to legend, the icon miraculously appeared in the monastery, and, after it was stolen once, it later reappeared in the same spot.

Perched on Mount Carmel near Haifa, this historic site has captivated many since ancient times.

The earliest mentions of Mount Carmel date back to Egyptian records from the 14th century BC, noting it as a conquest of Pharaoh Thutmose III. The allure of this sacred mountain attracted a group of devout hermits who established a monastery here, dedicating it to the Archangel St. Michael.

Today, the monastery is renowned for its chapel, a place of profound tranquillity and reflection. Beneath the altar lies a grotto believed to be the very cave where the prophet Elijah once lived.

In the 12th century, the Crusaders, recognising the site's strategic importance, fortified the monastery to serve the Carmelite order. The Carmelites extended their presence by founding another sanctuary at the southern tip of Mount Carmel and one at Wadi es-Siah, now evocative ruins.

New Europe

How did New York boroughs get their names?

What are the Dutch influences on New York place names?

How did New York's rivers and waterways get their names?

New York City is one of the most iconic cities in the world. Its image has been communicated around the world for several centuries, in particular in the20th century.

We see it in television shows, in plays and on film. It has been portrayed in literature and art, standing for business, culture, power and a symbol of the United States itself.

Because of this, we are familiar with the names of many places in New York City. This blog looks at the European roots of these place names, illustrated by cultural heritage items from across Europe.

The very name of New York and its locations have European colonial origins.

The New York region has been a homeland to Algonquian Native Americans for centuries. Since the 1600s, European powers have named the city, which traces its origins to a trading post founded on the southern tip of Manhattan Island by Dutch colonists.

The city was initially called New Amsterdam, capital of the DutchNieuw Nederlandscolony. It gained its current name in the 1660s when the Dutch surrendered the colony to the English.

It was named in honour of the Duke of York, who later became King James II of England. It has maintained the name New York for centuries (despite a short time as New Orange in the 1670s).

New York City has five boroughs: Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, The Bronx and Staten Island.

Brooklyn is named after Breukelen, a small Dutch town in the province of Utrecht.

The Bronx takes its name from Jonas Bronck, who, in 1639, was the first European settler in the area. His origins are not clear: scholars suggest he was from the Faroe Islands,Denmarkor possiblySweden.

Two further boroughs of New York - Queens and Staten Island - have European origins. Queens was named after the Portuguese royal princess, and later English Queen, Catherine of Braganza. Staten Island was namedStaaten Eylandtby the Dutch.

The name derived from theStaten Generaal, the parliament of the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands.

Only one of New York City's five boroughs retains a name that does not have European origins: Manhattan derives from a Munsee Lenape language termmanaháhtaan.

Many place names in New York reflect Dutch origins. The Flushing neighbourhood derives from the Dutch town Vlissingen.

Harlem is named after Haarlem, the capital of the province of North Holland.

Yonkers, a suburb of New York, takes its name from the Dutch wordjonkheer('young gentleman') which is a title similar to esquire. It was the title by which Adriaen van der Donck was known - he was the landowner to whom the area was given.

Coney Island comes fromConyne Eylandtmeaning 'Rabbit Island'.

Some place names go further back in history than the Dutch colony, with Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano lending his name to the Verrazzano Narrows Bridge, which connects Brooklyn to Staten Island, which spans waters he navigated in 1524.

The Hudson River takes its name from Henry Hudson, an English sailor who explored the river in 1609.

What was women's fashion in the early 1700s?

What was the Rococo influence on fashion?

How did fashion change in the 18th century?

How changes in 18th century women's fashion reflected shifts in society

The 18th century was a long period of profound change in women's fashion in Europe.

As society evolved through enlightenment, revolution, and industrialisation, so too did the clothing that women wore, reflecting both the opulence of the aristocracy and the emerging practicalities of a changing world.

The early 1700s were characterised by opulent and grandiose styles, heavily influenced by the Baroque period.

The main components of women's fashion includedrobe de cour, a formal court dress with fitted bodice with a low, square neckline and a voluminous skirt supported bypanniers(wide side hoops), andmantuas, informal gowns which turned into more formal attires by the early 18th century, open in the front to reveal a petticoat.

Stays - or, as they came to be called later, corsets - were also very important. Stays were early corsets, essential for achieving the desired silhouette, cinching the waist and supporting the bust, creating a conical shape. The garments were made in luxurious fabrics such as silk, satin, and brocade, and were adorned with lace, embroidery, and ribbons, emphasising wealth and status.

Accessories - such as fans, gloves, shoes, and jewellery - also played a central role in the definition of feminine elegance. Hairstyles were too considered a fashionable element: fontanges, a trend from France, were tall, elaborate headdresses made of lace and ribbons.

As the century progressed, fashion became more playful, influenced by the Rococo art movement's emphasis on lightness and even more decoration.

Soft pastel colours and delicate floral patterns became popular, reflecting the whimsical and romantic aesthetics of the Rococo period. France maintained its role as ‘maker’ of fashion, and therobe à la française, or sack-back gown, featuring a loose back pleated from the shoulders and fitted front bodice, was the most popular garment at this time. The skirts were wide, supported by panniers, and often had layered petticoats.

Hair was styled higher, often adorned with ribbons, flowers, and feathers and white powdered wigs and even more elaborate hairstyles became fashionable, complemented by make up to obtain pale complexion, thanks to powders, and of course, beauty patches.

The latter part of the 18th century saw dramatic shifts in fashion, influenced by Enlightenment ideals and revolutionary fervour, leading to more simplified and practical fashions.

Therobe à l'anglaise, or English gown, with a fitted bodice with a full skirt that was less voluminous than earlier styles, became the norm. It was practical and elegant, often made from printed cotton.

Another interesting style was thechemise à la Reine, apparently popularised by Marie Antoinette, a simple chemise made of white muslin, symbolising a move towards naturalism and simplicity.

Other styles became popular around the 1770s and 1780s.

Therobe à la polonaisewas light and informal dress with a fitted anglaise back and a skirt that can be drawn up on interior tapes into swags. It took its name from Queen Maria Leczinska, who was married to Louis XV. Therobe à la Turquewas a dress with long sleeves and the upper skirts (or manteau) of a different colour than the petticoat, sleeves and bodice/corsage, often worn with a sash around the waist.

Towards the French Revolution (1789-1799) especially, hairstyles became simpler, with less powdered hair and more natural looks, often adorned with modest accessories like ribbons or small caps. The French Revolution then brought a decline in extravagant fashion. Simpler, more practical clothing became the norm, influenced by the ideals purported by the revolutionaries.

In this quick trip through 18th century feminine fashions, it is clear that the period witnessed dynamic change in women's fashion, from the grandeur of early Baroque styles to the playful Rococo and the practical simplicity inspired by revolutionary ideals. Each phase reflected broader societal shifts, encapsulating the spirit of the times.

Sámi, the only recognised Indigenous people living in European Union

How Sámi build relations with their Finnish neighbours

How technology came to Sápmi

Are Sámi living traditional or modern lives?

How Indigenous Sámi reindeer herders came to live in houses and adapted new technologies, challenging the dichotomy of traditional and modern.

Each year, 9 August marks the International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples. The theme of the year is 'protecting the rights of Indigenous peoples in voluntary isolation and initial contact', in order to strengthen cultural and linguistic diversity.

There are about 200 voluntarily isolated Indigenous groups in the world. However, the majority of Indigenous peoples live side-by-side with other peoples.

The Sámi homeland,Sápmiin Northern Sámi language, is located in the northern parts of Norway, Sweden and Finland, and on the Kola Peninsula in Russia. In total, nine Sámi languages are spoken in the area. Different groups have, for example, their own traditional dress, handicrafts, and objects.

Even though approximately 10% of the Sámi work in reindeer husbandry, the Sámi are still perhaps best known as semi-nomadic reindeer people. Other natural sources of livelihood such as fishing, hunting and small-scale farming have also been important factors defining Sámi cultures.

In general, culture is characterised by a strong connection with nature. The knowledge derived from this relationship enables life in the arctic conditions. In addition to food, materials for tools, objects and clothes are obtained from the surrounding environment. What could not be obtained from nearby nature was obtained from further away.

The Sámi created and maintained their relations with other peoples, for example, through trade. Foreign elements, such as silver jewellery, have been integrated into the Sámi material culture. Coffee breaks, in Northern Sámigáfeboddu, by the fire have become sites for exchanging news and telling stories.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the Sámi people established reciprocal relationships with their Finnish neighbours.

The host-guest relations were based on mutual benefit or exchange of gifts between different ethnic groups practising different livelihoods. In Northern Sámi language, the relationships were calledverddet. The word loosely refers to equal partners.Verddetare a long-term acquaintance or friend with whom one stays when travelling.

Sámi visited and lived in the households ofverddetespecially during the winter. The rhythm of life was determined by seasonality and the migration patterns of reindeer. Before the 20th century, Sámi did not establish permanent residency.

The elderly and children were sometimes left in the warm Finnish houses during the long and dark winter months, when weather conditions challenged the herders the most.

Politicians and heads of state have also been described asverddet.

The most famous 'Southernverddet' was President Urho Kekkonen, who ruledFinlandfrom 1956 until 1982. Kekkonen met his fellow Sámi during his ski trips in Lapland.

Characteristics ofverddetcan also be seen today in the relationships between the Sámi and tourists.

It is possible that theverddetsystem contributed to the sedentarisation of the Sámi.

In the 1950s, border fences between states were built for herding. The reindeer and their people could no longer migrate beyond the border. By settling down in houses, reindeer Sámi adopted a new, more sedentary lifestyle.

In the 1960s, the snowmobile was introduced to reindeer herding. The motorised vehicle spread very quickly among herders who had earlier trusted in their own feet, skis and reindeer. The snowmobile made it possible for the herder to do his work from home as they could now access remote pastures quicker.

To cover new expenses, many herders were forced to increase the number of reindeer. The reciprocal relationship between human and reindeer changed drastically. Market economy turned herders into meat producers.

In 2024, the reindeer Sámi live in houses, locate their reindeer using GPS and wear Gore-tex. The abundance of technology may raise the question of what is left of traditional Sámi reindeer herding.

Tools change, but knowledge about reindeer, its habitat and how to survive in it has been preserved through oral tradition. Adapting to changing circumstances and being resourceful, is an important feature in the Sámi culture. The Northern Sámi verbbirget, to manage, is somewhat similar to the concept of resilience.

Western thinking is based on dualisms, the separation of things. Nature is separated from man and traditional from modern. A Westerner understands the authenticity of Indigenous culture as the absence of modernity.

Cultures are in constant change. That's what makes them robust. However, Indigenous peoples should have the right to choose the extent to which they want to be in contact with other peoples.

The same applies to the right to decide which elements in culture are to be kept unchanged and which aspects require some updating. The Sámi themselves define what is traditional and worth preserving in their culture.

About the author

In May-July 2024, thirteen participants took part in the second edition of the Online Creative Residency from Europeana’s Digital Storytelling Festival. Janire Goikoetxea created a video essay using 3D objects to tell a universal story.

Exploring the theme of 'journey', participants worked with mentors in animation, social media, collage art, storytelling with 3D, and creative writing.

Who am I?

My name is Janire Goikoetxea and I’m a Spanish Art Historian specialising in contemporary and digital arts. I work as an independent writer and arts educator in a museum.

I have always been drawn to the technologically-driven realms of artistic expression. My work focuses on extended reality technologies and the analysis of aesthetic and social experiences on the internet. I'm particularly interested in the power of online community-based practices, such as online music  culture and social XR, as tools for exploring the digital folklore and heritage of our time.

What is my project about?

‘The Journey Skyward’ is a video essay that brings together various 3D models of European  architecture and objects to tell a universal story: humanity's eternal fascination with reaching the sky. When our ancestors turned to technology to bring us closer to heaven, they did so with the weight of stone, laying one block after another until we could ascend from its foundations.

Technology has liberated us from the constraints of gravity, providing us with a new way to appreciate art and heritage from viewpoints that the original creators and designers once intended solely for the eyes of gods. This project celebrates humanity's journey to the conquest of the bird's eye view.

Why did I apply for the Online Creative Residency?

This year presented a new opportunity to work with the 3D collections from Europeana.eu and the latest models from theTwin it! campaign. I was eager to explore new applications for these digitisation projects.

Using 3D as a tool for storytelling is relatively new, and there is significant  potential for innovative approaches to using these high-quality models. From creating immersive environments to repurposing the models as artistic objects, the creative freedom they offer is always exciting.

What have I got out of the residency?

It has given me the opportunity to share ideas and conversations with industry professionals and to gain a deeper understanding of the technology behind heritage digitisation. During these months, I have been able to explore all the innovations being made in this field and connect them with my artistic, historical and philosophical interests. Moreover, I will never look at a building again, whether from a plane or through the eyes of a flying avatar, without feeling grateful for having this new perspective!

What will I do next?

I will continue working with 3D environments, which, along with VR, have always been my passion and feel like my second home. I will keep researching new methods to engage audiences with digital heritage, as I plan to pursue further studies in Applied Technologies for Cultural Heritage to blend these skills with my career in writing, storytelling techniques and arts education.

What were phantasmagoria shows?

How were phantasmagoria shows used for science and education?

Digitising the magic lantern

How the phantasmagoria magic lantern was used for entertainment, science and education

The phantasmagoria magic lantern is an evolved model of the magic lantern, an image projection device that preceded cinema projectors. Placing a magic lantern on wheels allows for phantasmagorias - some projection effects that became popular at the end of the 18th century.

These visual shows made spectres, monsters, ghosts and other kinds of 'paranormal' images appear.

Étienne-Gaspard Robert (known as Robertson) was responsible for this improvement to the magic lantern. He placed the projector behind a translucent screen to hide it from viewers, as well as placing the lantern on wheels to generate an illusion of movement in the projected image.

He also created a mechanism to coordinate the wheels of the lantern with the lens, in order to focus or blur the projected image as desired. The lantern projected images painted on a glass plate, and also opaque and three-dimensional images using the camera obscura technique.

The name phantasmagoria was well-deserved.

Apart from the images of ghostly characters, the experience was immersive. The audience sat in a darkened room. The walls were often painted black, with sinister sound and light effects, as well as projections of smoke or smells of incense used to complete the experience.

At the beginning of the 19th century, phantasmagoria shows became popular throughout Europe and the United States.

At the same time, however, the secrets of Robertson's phantasmagoria were revealed and exploited by many others to make their own entertainment shows. Their success began to decline when viewers started knowing the tricks, and the surprise effect disappeared.

Beyond the use for variety shows, some of the most prestigious scientific and optical devices companies continued manufacturing phantasmagoria magic lanterns.

Scientific and educational institutions around the world started using this type of magic lantern, as it allowed them to experiment with projection techniques and optical principles.

In 1849, the old Institut de Segon Ensenyament de Girona (Institute of Secondary Education of Girona) - which had been established in 1845 - purchased scientific instruments for the physics and chemistry cabinets, including the phantasmagoria magic lantern.

This device, manufactured by the French company Lérebours and Sécretan, performed all the projection techniques from phantasmagoria shows: back projection, projection of opaque bodies, movement of the projector, focus of the image, regulation of light intensity.

The use of the magic lantern as an educational tool became popular from the middle of the 19th century in European and North American educational institutions, and was used by the Institut of Girona until approximately 1885.

The old Institute of Secondary Education of Girona, which was located in the old Capuchin convent, moved to a new location in 1967.

Its original building, owned by the Girona City Council, is today the headquarters of the Girona History Museum and the Municipal Archive and CRDI – Centre for Image Research and Dissemination. The phantasmagoria magic lantern became part of the collection of the History Museum and, subsequently, it was incorporated into the collection of the Girona Cinema Museum.

180 years after the manufacture of this device, the same walls that hosted the Institute of Secondary Education now host the CRDI - Centre for Image Research and Dissemination.

CRDI is one of the partners of theEUreka3Dproject, which contributes to the digital transformation of cultural heritage institutions. One of its contributions to the project is to digitise in 3D and in high quality 50 pieces of pre-cinema and early cinema from the Cinema Museum collection: among them the magic lantern of phantasmagoria.

The magic lantern was an important part of the history of image projection before cinema and, at the same time, a relevant device in the study of optics and physics by researchers and students.

Today, this device has been digitised in 3D as part of the EUreka3D project for preservation, research and educational uses. The conjunction between art and science that distinguished the lifetime of this object is still alive today when, thanks to this project, technology and cultural heritage go hand-in-hand.

This blog is part of theEUreka3D project, which aims to build the capacity of small cultural heritage institutions in digital transformation, particularly on issues related to 3D digitisation.

The call for home - Kuoksu, Sweden

About the author

In May-July 2024, thirteen participants took part in the second edition of the Online Creative Residency from Europeana’s Digital Storytelling Festival. Angelina Fors explored her family history to add a human touch to the collections of her home region.

Exploring the theme of 'journey', participants worked with mentors in animation, social media, collage art, storytelling with 3D, and creative writing.

I am born in the little stream I call home,My life is complete in seven years.I swim, I eat, I grow.When I am old enough, I swim downstreamTo the vast ocean, deep and dark.I swim, I live, I learn.

Then I feel the call for home.It starts as a tugging in my scales,And I know. I know, I know.So I make the journey home,To the little pond and stream I call home.I go, I mate,I give my short, radiant life,To the stream I call home.

My cycle is at an end,And the end is where it begins,And it begins where it ends,With the call for home.My time has come, and I swim upstream,I slow down, pulse stops, my last shuddering breath.Then I die, washed ashore with brothers and sisters,New ones are born, life returned.

I live, I go, I come home,I die, I give, they live,In the little stream,I call home.

You never quite know when that last summer along the Torne river with your grandparents will be. Then, you’ve had it but you didn’t know, and you never knew you would never have it again.

Watching through the glass walls of your memories is a cruel hobby only those with regret indulge in, as addictive as any.

The ticking of the old clock echoes as my feet shuffle through the creaking door. The sun rising on the horizon, hitting the window and blinding me as I rub sleep from my eyes. They´re all packed, ready to drive north. Past the Arctic circle, past the Jockfall and the salmon returning home to die, either for their eggs or for us.

Grandpa sits to the left on the green table, smiling as he eats his oatmeal straight from the pan having finished his morning run. Grandma pulls out the chair and pours milk over my bowl, topped with lingonberry jam.

The quiet as dawn yawns along with me, my grandparents´ eyes crinkling with indulging smiles as they woke long before me and the sun.

The clock ticks more quietly in the day, as if the sun itself has hushed it. They drink their coffee, speaking low inMeänkieliabout things I don’t understand in a language I never learned. 'In my day, we learned to drink coffee at the age of three.' A story grandma always repeats whenever me or my cousin are picky about food.

I remember feeling smug when I showed them my homework, they were so stupid for not knowing English. A memory that burns me with shame. If only I could go back. All I have are the memories they left behind. The images of their being, the sounds of their existence, and the feeling of their roots spreading out inside my DNA. Their existence a call for home I never thought I would feel.

I bang on the glass.Let me in.

Flour puffs up as she kneads. Grandpa wipes his shoes in the hallway as he comes in, holding the tiny sharp hooks. I know they´re sharp because the year before, my cousin hooked one in his ear when he threw it from behind to reach as far out into the Torne River as he could. I know he wanted to cry, but he didn’t. So neither did I.

Grandma speaks to Grandpa inMeänkieli. My mood sours. He smiles. 'Are you ready?'

I was never nice in the mornings,  I simply nod as I purse my ungrateful lips so I don’t lash out, trying to choke down the disrespect. Yet, it can’t help but spill onto my face as it twists my features into frowns and grunts and huffs. If only I could go back, slap my younger self, and yell at her, or better, take her place. But the memory plays out as it always does. The younger me, idiotic and moronic and all the other adjectives for stupid, while I watch from behind that cruel glass wall in the hallway of my mind. Always trapped. Always forced to see the memories play out the same way, over and over and over again.

I bang and I bang and I bang but the glass never cracks, never breaks.

The mosquitoes are killing me. Buzzing, biting, hunting. Grandpa always sighs at my annoyance, thinking I was a spoiled city girl. 
I was. Compared to him.

We hike up the mountain,hismountain. He points over the horizon in the dense forest and tells me his land ends at the lake at the bottom of our mountain and stretches over it to the right. 'I was the oldest of my thirteen siblings, so this mountain is mine.'

What I loathe about this memory is how he tells me the name of our small mountain, not big enough to be found on Google, not big enough to matter to anyone but me. Him. Grandma. Our family. He said the name of our mountain wasTaulovara. But I have no idea, no f****** clue, how to spell it. I remember the syllables tumbling out, running over his tongue, the sound they made as they travelled on the winds of his voice, making their way through my ear, and lodging themselves into my brain, branding them into memory forever.

But I didn’t care enough then to ask, to tell him to show me more. To ask how to spell our small, stupid f****** mountain. I did not realise this mountain was all that would be left after his remains turned to ash.

I bang on the glass again, begging the younger me to ask. But she never does. SoTaulovarais how I am forced to spell it, because I never cared enough about our history, about them, until there was no one left to tell me.

The bread swells as Grandma puts the dough on themuurikka, the flames of our fire heating it from below. The smoke from the fire keeps the mosquitoes at bay but I still hear their incessant hunt for blood just outside the protection of the smoke.

The river always scared me. Despite it, I had said nothing as we took the tiny boat upstream to this tiny island. The darkness of the water made my knuckles white and muscles freeze when the boat rocked. Their stories of how the water looks calm but if you fall in, will pull you under like a beast trying to feast.

Grandpa was by the water, cleaning the fish we would grill with the bread. The reindeer hide under me kept the wet and cold at bay, the hairs itching through my pants. 'The butter is in the cooler.' Grandma points at the grotesque blue and white ancient-looking box filled with white plastic ice-blocks. I take the butter out, smearing it on the bread, still warm from cooking over open fire.

I bang on the glass.Let me in.Just one more time. One last time.Let me in.

Who am I?

I am currently completing my degree in Comparative Literature and Creative Writing in Sweden as I spent the last five years in South Korea. I am also working on my novel along other projects.

Growing up in the north, a part of Sweden even most Swedes never get to experience, is something near and dear. It shaped me, followed with me to the other side of the world and their memories will follow me wherever I end up in the future.

A little bit of Kuoksu will always stay with me.

What is my project about?

These are small pieces of me, my family, our history, and hopefully, a more personalised history of a region largely forgotten. I hope that this will humanise and make a part of the world most don´t think about, to feel a little closer to home.

Why did I apply for the Online Creative Residency?

I saw it as a chance to show a side of my writing I don´t often delve into. It was also a new opportunity to grow as a writer and gain experience, as well as the unique opportunity Europeana offers that can show the little place I call home to others who might not even know it exists.

What have I got out of the residency?

Immense experience, inspiration from all of the creatives I´ve met through this residency, wonderful opportunity to learn and observe, and the fact that I have a small piece of my writing as well as my family´s history published. Their memory will live on.

What will I do next?

I think for now, these stories will be shelved. I might revisit them in the future but my focus now is my full-length novel I´ve been working on. It is still writing, though in a vastly different genre. I will take everything that I´ve learned and use it moving forward.

About the author

In May-July 2024, thirteen participants took part in the second edition of the Online Creative Residency from Europeana’s Digital Storytelling Festival. Liza Anesti created an animation based on an Icelandic landscape.

Exploring the theme of 'journey', participants worked with mentors in animation, social media, collage art, storytelling with 3D, and creative writing.

Icelandic midnight sunset by Liza Anesti

Who am I?

I am a graduate of the Faculty of Architecture of the Faculty of Engineering of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in Greece. During my studies, I focused on the reuse and restoration of the shells of old buildings and the need to use sustainable and local materials and techniques.

In addition, I designed and constructed the set design for some performances and did my internship as a set designer in Amsterdam. In terms of my working experience, I have worked as a junior landscape architect, especially on archaeological sites. I am currently experimenting with new storytelling techniques through illustration for children's books and stop-motion animation.

What is my project about?

The animated GIF I created during the Europeana Online Creative Residency is entitled ‘Midnight Sunset’ and is part of the residency's theme of ‘Journey’. For this short animation I was inspired by Icelandic landscapes, colours and textures. Through my trip to Iceland I observed the unique shapes and forms of the island, the contrasts and transitions of the colours of the sky and clouds, and the lines of the rocky masses that disappear into the horizon.

Why did I apply to the Digital Storytelling Festival Online Creative Residency?

I was interested in participating because I wanted to gain new storytelling skills through this creative process. In addition, I was excited by the opportunity to create with the guidance of an expert in a safe and supportive environment.

What have I got out of the residency?

Through the residency we had the opportunity to discuss the process of creating a GIF animation and familiarise ourselves with the software and the available collections of Europeana.eu that we could use for our creations.

What will I do next?

I would like to keep creating GIFs and explore the creative possibilities of the Europeana.eu archive.

About the author

In May-July 2024, thirteen participants took part in the second edition of the Online Creative Residency from Europeana’s Digital Storytelling Festival. Maya Mircheva created beautiful collage art exploring Romani heritage.

Exploring the theme of 'journey', participants worked with mentors in animation, social media, collage art, storytelling with 3D, and creative writing.

Who am I?

I have always been fascinated with art and creativity. While I am currently working as an IT professional, I am studying for a degree in visual communications and I am particularly interested in the power of images as a storytelling tool. Lately, I have developed a keen interest in collage as a tool for artistic expression. I am particularly attracted by its versatility and unique ability to express complex or abstract ideas.

What is my project about?

My piece is a homage to the culture of Romani travellers. I wanted to approach the theme of ‘journey’ through the lens of the life of this ethnic group since journey or travelling is a big part of their identity. I used source material from Europeana.eu which would help me show their unique cultural heritage and celebrate some of the traditional Romani values - freedom, tradition, family and kin, pride and resilience.

Why did I apply to the Digital Storytelling Online Creative Residency?

I applied for the residency because collage is an important part of my emerging practice. I wanted to explore new sources of material, such as Europeana.eu, and learn new approaches and techniques.

I was also curious to learn more about the Europeana database and how to navigate its huge collections. Coming across copyright-free images for collage is challenging and in this sense Europeana.eu offers an unique opportunity for collage artists.

What have I got out of the residency?

My tutor Cosmina helped me look at collage in a different way. I discovered new ways to work with collage in a more seamless manner, a method which elevates the practice to the level of fine art. I also learned a structured way to brainstorm ideas and create a story on which to base my collage. Furthermore, I was encouraged to critically reflect on my work.

What will I do next?

I will take what I have learned into my design and illustration practice. I have already used Europeana.eu images and some of the techniques learned during the residency in other side projects. I may further develop my collage practice as a form of fine art or I may also use collage in animation, since it is another domain which I am currently exploring as part of my studies.

What is the role of the International Olympic Committee?

What happened at the Paris Olympic Games in 1900?

What happened at the 1924 Paris Olympic Games?

Paris Olympic Games in 2024

Exploring the history of the Olympic Games in Paris in 1900 and 1924

Paris, the city of lights, situated at the centre of the Île-de-France, is one of the most beautiful cities in the world. More than 2,000 years old, the city continues to dazzle and to position itself as a leading venue for historical events such as world sports.

Paris is hosting the 2024 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games. If we look at its history, Paris has twice before hosted the Olympic Games - first as far back as 1900 and, for the second time, in 1924. Let’s take a look at how it all started.

French educator and historian Pierre de Coubertin established the International Olympic Committee on 23 June 1894 at the Olympic Congress, in an effort to promote sports as a way to revive the Olympic Games ofancient Greece.

An important step in organising the Olympic Games was the way that cities could bid to host the games, assuring that the spectacular event would be shared with a wider audience around the world.

The founding of the International Olympic Committee has been celebrated as International Olympic Day every year on 23 June since 1948.

At the beginning of the re-establishment of theOlympic Games, there was rather limited interest in such a large sporting event. There was controversy about the kinds of games that were to be permanent features. Sports such as boules, fishing and hurling were not recognised as legitimate games.

The 1900 Olympic Games took place within the framework of theExposition Universelle(World’s Fair), an event celebrating the achievements of the past century and developments into the next. TheExposition Universellecompeted with the Olympics Games - they did not attract as much attention as expected as there were many competing events.

Paris faced many challenges as host of the international games, including around  which sports would be recognised as part of the Olympic Games at that time and into the future. Pierre de Coubertin had to confront the organisers of theExposition Universelleto have the sporting events permitted the title of Olympic Games, some of which were included late.

Due to the delay, many athletes did not realise they had even competed in the Olympic Games - instead, many assumed they were taking part in theExposition Universelle.

Despite the challenges, traditional competitions such as swimming, high and long jumps, hurdles, as well as gymnastics and cycling took place. A marathon race, freestyle swimming and fencing were also part of the 1900 Olympic Games.

Distance runner Michel Théato takes part in the marathon at the 1900 Paris Olympic Games, an event which he won.

28 countries sent athletes to compete in 95 total events. Countries as far away as Haiti and Peru participated.

The 1900 Olympic Games featured women for the first time - though with limited access to events as Pierre de Coubertin disapproved of women participating in public competitions. Nonetheless, 22 women competed in five sports: tennis, sailing, golf, equestrianism and croquet.

However, like some of the other athletes, golfer Margaret Abbott had no idea she participated in the Olympic Games, and that she was the first American woman to win an Olympic event.

American golfer Margaret Abbott, plays in the 1900s Olympic Games Women's golf event. She won with a score of 47 strokes.

British tennis player Charlotte Cooper won the singles championship and became the first individual woman Olympic champion. She also won the mixed doubles event.

Paris became the first city to host the Olympic Games twice. By 1924, there was growing interest on an international level. 44 countries sent athletes this time.

Track and Field and a new Olympic-sized swimming pool that included marked lanes made for an exciting competition among the growing elite athletes competing at the games.

One of these athletes was the future film star,Johnny Weissmuller.

American swimmer Johnny Weissmuller brought attention to the 1924 Olympic Games by dominating the swimming 100m and 400m freestyle and the 4X200m relay team races.

British athlete Harold Abrahams won the 100m dash in a time of 10.6 seconds.

British athlete Eric Liddell refused to run the 100 metres race for religious reasons as the event was held on a Sunday. He instead competed in the 400 metres held on a weekday and won.

The British athletes Harold Abrahams and Eric Liddell would later be featured in the 1981 Oscar winning filmChariots of Fire.

The United States were in command of the 1924 Olympic Games. The team won 32 medals overall, with long-jumper William DeHart Hubbard becoming the first Black American to win an Olympic gold medal.

French fencer Roger Ducret won five medals, three of which were gold.

135 women took part in the 1924 Olympic Games, though their participation was still limited to sports such as swimming, tennis, diving and fencing.

The 1924 games were the first time women’s fencing was introduced, and was won by Danish foil fencer Ellen Ossier. The USA women's swim team members, which included athletes Ethel Lackie and Getrude Ederle, took 10 medals between them and French tennis player Julie Vlasto won silver in the tennis singles.

This time, the Olympic Games received crowds reaching up to 60,000 daily.

The 1924 Olympic Games introduced the Closing Ceremony ritual used to this day, raising the flag of the International Olympic Committee, the flag of the host nation and the flag of the next host country.

In 2024, Paris is hosting the Olympic Games for a third time. The Olympic flame travelled from Athens to Marseille and through many iconic places in France, both inside and outside the mainland.

More than 200 countries and 10,000 athletes are participating. The Olympic Games always provides challenges, as can be seen through local protests about lack of housing and the disregard for the homeless amongst many other things. The city's goal of making these Olympic Games one of the most sustainable to date sets an admirable example for future games. One can hope this may propel better Olympic goals towards listening to the most vulnerable communities and finding solutions that don't neglect their needs.

Like in the past,Pariswill provide a moment where we may appreciate what humankind is capable of achieving in the sport world by honouring the talents of athletes from across the world. Many will join in to celebrate their country's best athletes from the comforts of their homes or in Paris itself.

About the author

In May-July 2024, thirteen participants took part in the second edition of the Online Creative Residency from Europeana’s Digital Storytelling Festival. Peggy Komvotea created an interactive digital space dedicated to migration.

Exploring the theme of 'journey', participants worked with mentors in animation, social media, collage art, storytelling with 3D, and creative writing.

Who am I?

I'm an interior architect with masters degrees in creative writing, computational design and digital fabrication, and audiovisual digital arts.

I have a deep passion for storytelling in all its forms: visual, audio, 3D, digital or analogue, written or not. I find new stories everywhere. Whether sad or happy, they all have something to tell.

What is my project about?

The space is dedicated to the journey of migration. Within this space, I have presented photographs and artworks representing migrants to and from Europe throughout a number of migration periods. Also on display are virtual 3D artworks and installations that create a suitable setting for the museum or art space curator to tell the story of migrants. The story focuses on little but meaningful things like the suitcases, the new life the migrants made, or the life that they expected to make but did not.

Most of all,The European Migration Journey Museumis a virtual place that helps visitors travel with the migrants on life-changing trips. In the space there is also a separate room where people can upload their own story.

Why did I apply for the Online Creative Residency?

I applied to advance my creative writing skills by experimenting with different media. I also wanted to meet artists from all over Europe, see their artwork, and be mentored by creative people.

What have I got out of the residency?

For the first time, I tried to make a museum in Metaverse. I experimented with 3D social spaces and virtual reality and created something that is not a video game but a cultural walkthrough into past and present migration experiences. This museum is also a place for people to meet and tell their own stories about migration.

What will I do next?

I would like to keep working on this project because it’s an interactive project that calls people to join and upload their stories. It’s very exciting to see how this project succeeds and if people can share their stories and learn about other people’s stories.

Marie-Antoinette

Darcy

Yves

Deafening silence

In this second blog about the colonial legacy in cultural heritage institutions, we dive deeper into how metadata and descriptions are seen and (re)interpreted. To learn more about this work and the DE-BIAS project, please read the first blog in this series, 'Colonial Depictions'.

We've gathered a few testimonies and pieces of feedback written by members of Intellectuele Congolese Kring, an organisation striving to represent the interest of the Congolese community in Belgium. They were invited to critique colonial descriptions of Congolese peoples and history, in collaboration with KU Leuven and KADOC. Below are some of their contributions.

Marie-Antoinette is a mother of three who works as a social worker.

Most of the words used in museum collection descriptions are not neutral, they rather have a negative connotation recalling the superiority of the white man compared to the black man. It shows not only the physical but also the moral and spiritual humiliation of the Congolese people. Almost all the words and images of the colonial period evoke the denigration of black people by white people while emphasising their authority and superiority in the management of society.

The phrase 'third world countries', for example, categorises those countries as weak and subordinate in relation to the 'first world countries'. I would have preferred the term 'developing countries' because it evokes hope and an evolutionary trend.

I don't like the termÉvolués, I prefer to talk aboutacculturation. The so-called 'évolués' black people were supposed to live like white people, assimilating their cultures: eating with spoons, knives and forks, dressing like white people, speaking their language, etc. Even though they acculturated to white culture, they would unfortunately always remain subordinate toBwana, the 'civiliser'.

I experience a similar feeling when it comes to the ‘inburgering’ (integration/integration and citizenship) courses, with the only difference being that with the latter they omit to mention their 'civilising mission'.

Darcy is a university student who is the liaison officer for students concerned about diversity and inclusion.

This photo is titled 'Picnic in Africa at the turn of the century'. The use of the word 'Africa' seems inappropriate here. It reminds us of the term 'African' which is often used as a generalist description for any black person.

Maybe the term 'Africa' was used here due to a lack of information: the curator didn't know where precisely the photo was taken. The rest of the description is also too vague, making the value and meaning of this photo unclear. Why should one be interested in this picture? Why is it important? None of this info is present in the description.

The photo above with the description 'Refugees' has similar issues to the previous photo. The use of the word 'refugees' immediately frames this image, disallowing viewers to see other interpretations of the photograph.

If the description denoted the purpose of the photographer for taking this picture, this would be useful to viewers to understand the photographer's thinking. For instance, 'the photographer wanted to demonstrate the circumstances in which the refugees from Manono were located'. At the same time, this would give viewers space to re-interpret the photograph differently from the photographer's original intentions.

Yves has co-founded an organisation aiming at providing children from Eastern Congo with educational opportunities.

I think this is a very beautiful photograph. It would fit perfectly in a fashion magazine. I do feel that the name of the person pictured should be mentioned in the metadata. That's the least one could do to honour the subject of the photograph. Who knows, maybe someone could recognise their forefathers through a photograph like this one, providing them with a piece of their family history?

I also wonder if this person has consented to having their picture taken. Was this a posed photo or was it taken without the subject's knowledge or permission?

The presence of basic, incomplete or poor metadata is problematic: the lack of depth, precision or substance makes it almost impossible to assess whether descriptions or labels of cultural objects were intended or could be interpreted as harmful.

This lays bare a phenomenon often spotted when working with contested heritage: we often don't have all the information about the journey and provenance of an artefact. Either the trail of information is incomplete, or it was never documented in the first place. In many cases the bias rests in the silence of the descriptions: the elements (un)consciously ignored, passed over by ignorance or intention.

TheDE-BIAS projectaims to highlight underrepresented voices as a starting point to recontextualise contentious cultural heritage collections. Through co-creation events, crowdsourcing initiatives, the creation of a vocabulary and knowledge graph of contentious terms, and the creation of an online tool to detect biased terms in cultural heritage metadata, DE-BIAS aims to help the cultural heritage sector into the postcolonial era.

Defining the wicker chair

Early wicker finds

Craftsmanship through the ages

The arrival of rattan in Europe

Natural materials

Design

Synthetic materials

Museums are invaluable repositories of our collective history, showcasing artefacts telling stories of past civilisations. Yet, amidst the vast collections displayed online, one might notice a curious gap in knowledge regarding a humble yet significant item: the wicker or basket chair.

'A wicker chair is entirely or partly made of wicker.'

This definition might seem straightforward, but it encompasses a rich tapestry of materials and techniques. Wicker traditionally refers to basketwork crafted from interlaced slender branches or plant fibers, such as grasses. It typically comprises a static (stake/grass coil) and an active (strand/binder), intricately woven together.

Wickerwork may pre-date pottery, with evidence of its existence dating back thousands of years.

In Iraq, Dutch archaeologists have unearthed concave pottery shards bearing impressions of wicker baskets used as clay lasts. Around 200 AD, Roman soldiers from Gaul (France) brought small statues of the Dea Nutrix along the northern border of the Roman empire. Dea Nutrix statues portray the goddess sitting in a wicker chair and nursing two babies. Early Christian sarcophagi in the Vatican, show that the stake and strand wicker chairs had the highest divine status in the 4th century.

The earliest tools used in wickerwork were as simple as the materials themselves. The techniques of wicker crafting have evolved from coiling grass thousands of years BCE to creating complex modernist designs out of wicker.

In the 17th century, European colonists from Portugal, Britain and Holland heading to southeast Asia marveled at the very heavy ebony 'Company Chairs', based on the Dutch 'knob chairs'. The seat mat was made of durable rattan-skein. Even though the seat was thin as paper and translucent as lace, it was sturdy enough to sit on safely!

The arrival of rattan in Europe marked a turning point. For 200 years, until around 1850, rattan was only used to secure cargo on sailing ships. Seawater was drained to the bottom of the ship through vertical rattan bundles, after which the water was pumped overboard.

Willow sticks and twigs were popular for bentwood chairs made by nomadic people, as they do not have stationary workshops and many tools like a furniture maker would. They could make willow furniture with nothing more than a hammer, a saw and some nails.

By the mid-19th century, Cyrus Wakefield in Boston realised that the qualities of rattan were superior to willow. It was more durable and more pliable, resulting in flat decoration spirals. The core could be cut overlength into very long strands with constant diameter.

Rattan is a climbing plant of the palm family. Its solid core allows crafts people to work with this material as they were used to with willow.

Together with rattan, bamboo was introduced in Europe for furniture making in the late 19th century.

Bamboo is hollow inside, it prefers to snap instead to curve. Only a heated bamboo strip is easy to bend. The construction is a matter of making joints with a hole that has the diameter for the smaller stick.

By 1900, the traditional spirals in rattan furniture design gave way to more straightforward designs influenced by turn-of-the-century architecture. Movements such as Bauhaus ushered in sleek, minimalist styles and iron tube chairs.

Architect Ida Falkenberg-Liefrinck realised that iron tube chairs were too expensive for most people. Rattan chairs were a cheaper alternative. During World War II, the transport of rattan to Holland was blocked. In 1946, she and Elmar Bercovich designed a modern buff stained willow chair.

Soon after the war, rattan became available again and chairs with loop legs became very popular. In the 1930s, designers started curving rattan reeds like pretzels or figure-eights. After World War II, these chairs got the nickname 'Belse-8'.

These curved rattan chair legs did not appease the modernist sensibilities of the 1950s.

The rattan legs were replaced by iron rods and tubes that carried a rattan cup. Van Sliedregt designed an iron tube frame with a loose rattan seat. Jan Herbert Roe of Rohé designed the very  popular 'Kuipje 149' chair, which won an award at the Triennale of Milan 1957.

Innovation continued with the introduction of synthetic materials. The Rohé Rotan Factory's 'STALON' line, featured iron tube frames and seats strung with plastic wire.

This new line shocked traditional wickerwork craftsmen, but it paved the way for the weather-resistant outdoor furniture we know today.

By understanding the rich history, techniques and materials of wickerwork, we can appreciate the artistry and innovation behind these seemingly simple objects.

The New Woman opposed to Victorian morality

The story of Judith Shakespeare

Unknown women and their liberation

What would happen if Shakespeare had a sibling as talented and passionate as him?

What if the only difference between Shakespeare and his sibling was that she was a woman? Let’s look at how a fictional character helped shine a light on the systematic oppression of women in the field of literature.

Virginia Woolf asked herself (and her readers) the same question, developing 'Shakespeare’s Sister Theory' in her renowned extended essay,A Room of One’s Own.

InA Room of One’s Own, published in 1929, Woolf deals with the perception of women writers in her time, providing her generation (and the following ones) with a portrait of the 'new woman'.

With the start of the 20th century and the turmoil that World War I brought upon Europe, everything that we thought was true about life and society was now up for questioning.

This shift in thinking (which would later be called the Modernist Era) covered society as a whole and radically changed the perspective that people – including but not limited to intellectuals, writers, philosophers – had of the world and society.

It contributed to a gradual disintegration of Victorian values in a world that was quickly progressing in technology, ideology and economics.

The part of society that changed most quickly and most drastically concerned  the role of women, from the idealised 'Angel in the House' model referenced in the poem of the same name by English poet Conventry Patmore, to ‘The New Woman’.

The New Woman was primarily a feminist concept that, although born in the late 19th century, peaked in the 20th century.

The New Woman sought independence, equality and longed to have her own personal interests not dictated or imposed by societal norms.

The concept of The New Woman was someone who didn’t need a husband to financially take care of her, who had her own money and did not rely on marriage  in order to survive and live a decent life.

This archetype opposed the 'Angel of the House' concept that thrived during the 19th century. The Angel praised traditional family values, charity and purity. The feminine figure was like an accessory for a settled and respectable man. Her role was exclusively one of a housekeeper, a mother, or a lady at best, with no money of her own and no autonomy over her own life whatsoever.

The idea of the New Woman overcoming Victorian morality aroused interest in the literary and philosophic field. One of the most influential figures of the 20th century that was both inspired by and an inspiration for the feminist movement was Virginia Woolf.

English essayist, novelist and activist Virginia Woolf is best known for her influence on the Modernist era of literature. She became a feminist and LGBTQ+ icon worldwide.

Her most influential essay 'A Room Of One’s Own' explores social injustices, comments on women's lack of free expression and addresses the issues that women writers had to face and were still facing in the literary field despite writing becoming more accessible to those who wished to pursue it.

In one section of the book-length essay, Woolf creates a fictional character: Judith Shakespeare. She is as educated as her brother William, equally talented and driven to write. Unlike her brother, she is tied to the duties imposed on her by society, which inextricably bind her to the 'Angel in the House' figure mentioned earlier.

Judith barely 'scribbles some pages', and if she does, she makes sure 'to set them on fire' to not get caught.

Woolf’s Judith is an avid reader, but she constantly gets interrupted by her parents, who tell her to get back to house chores and activities that were considered suitable for a young lady.

They would have spoken sharply but kindly, for they were substantial people who knew the conditions of life for a woman and loved their daughter – indeed, more likely than not she was the apple of her father’s eye.

Judith’s parents are not always portrayed in a bad light, nor are they direct oppressors of their daughter: they act like a product of their time, following the standards by which they were raised themselves.

Woolf’s heroine grows up and escapes from her home to avoid marriage. She tries to get hired in a theatre but every man she encounters ridicules her, crushing her dreams of writing and acting.

Judith meets an actor and manager who deceives her after saying he will help her and that she will be recognised as a genius just like her brother. She becomes pregnant by him and eventually kills herself.

This patriarchal world is not escapable for Judith. First she suffers it through her upbringing with her family and then in her search to find freedom. The only choices Judith has are within a life that will always be controlled by men in some shape or form.

Woolf acknowledges that there have always been brilliant women that could have been writers, scientists, athletes and more. The only reason there are no records of them is because the women were (in her time) both socially and physically restrained from reaching their aspirations and goals.

The only solution to these social injustices, according to Woolf, is for modern women to have 'a room of one’s own'. This metaphor condenses the whole concept of the essay: for a woman to be successful, she needs to have her own independence. She must have a room 'with key and lock' only for herself and she must have money, in order to not financially depend on anybody. This was the imagined ideal of The New Woman.

Decolonising collections

The infamous quote 'History is written by the victors' doesn't only pertain to the history of war: it also denotes how oppressors shape the narrative around the people they oppress.

For centuries, European curators and archivists have described and archived colonial artefacts, often without a clear idea of the context of these objects that didn't belong to the culture or lived experience of those describing them.  This has left European cultural heritage collections filled with objects and descriptions that contain harmful, minimising, exoticising, and/or racist language and imagery.

People are increasingly being exposed to these harmful depictions and descriptions in cultural heritage institutions due to mass digitisation without sufficient critical reflection and updating of metadata.

Cultural heritage institutions are increasingly trying to come to terms with this contentious past. One way to do so is by repatriating objects or providing important historical context to colonial depictions. Another way is by giving minoritised communities better access to the collections, allowing them to explore, reinterpret, and reclaim their own histories.

TheDE-BIAS projectis one initiative working towards a postcolonial cultural heritage sphere. It does so, in part, by inviting minoritised groups and their allies to redescribe, critique, give feedback on and co-manage cultural heritage collections, in the hope of coming to a more respectful and less imbalanced view of this heritage.

This blog gathers testimonies and pieces of feedback written by members of Intellectuele Congolese kring, an organisation striving to represent the interests of the Congolese community in Belgium. They were invited to critique and consider colonial depictions of Congolese peoples and history, in collaboration with KU Leuven and KADOC. Below are some of their contributions.

Othi is a writer and poet who writes in a local Congolese language.

This photo is called 'A Congolese beauty' but there is nothing beautiful about this photo. We see how this photo sexually objectifies the black woman, who must show nudity to be beautiful. The woman doesn't look happy either, she looks sad, very sad and powerless. If it was a white woman, this photo wouldn't be like this. We probably would be seeing a fully dressed woman, smiling and looking at the camera.

I would call this photo 'Congolese sadness'  instead of 'beauty'.

This is also a very demeaning image. It implies that the black man isn't manly enough to measure up to the white agent, as if his shortness is symbolic of his life. The black man is not dressed, the white officer is. Here we see again the power of the white man, his superiority and the feeling that he is better, while that is not the truth.

Pauline is in charge of communication at the Africamuseum in Tervuren

This image gives me mixed feelings. On the one hand, I appreciate the beauty and cultural richness that the women in the photo radiate. Their proud posture and refined clothing reflect a legacy of tradition and aesthetics deeply entrenched in Congolese society.

On the other hand, I realise this image was probably shown with different intentions than just to celebrate beauty. The photo was probably taken during the Universal Exhibition of Antwerp in 1894. In the context of that time, these women seem to be presented from a colonial, primitivist perspective, in which their cultural values and human dignity were undermined.

I feel that the intention behind this display was to dehumanise the Congolese and portray them as savages, without any depth or respect for the complexity of their society. There is a lack of context about the deep cultural richness and advanced social structures these women represent. Nevertheless, the image remains intriguing and contains a wealth of information about the rich civilisation and culture, often underappreciated, that these Congolese women embody.

Yves has co-founded an organisation aiming at providing children from Eastern Congo with educational opportunities.

This is a very beautiful picture to me. I see it shows three men from Ituri. I assume these are important figures. I would love to know their names. Maybe this is an old royal family? Who knows? They're posing here, but they're not laughing.

I don't know if they had given permission to have their picture taken, or what the goal of taking this photograph was. These questions arise when I look at this picture.

The contribution of the members of Intellectuele Congolese Kring to the discussion of these objects is crucial to show how the remnants of the colonial era reverberate in cultural heritage collections to this day. The photographs highlighted in this blog show the coloniser's gaze, framing, and thoughts. By listening to the contributions in this blog, we add another side to the story, another voice to the narrative.

Not just the objects themselves, but also the way they are described in the metadata can be potentially harmful. In the blog Colonial Descriptions, we highlight how members of Congolese Kring reflect on the words and descriptions used in colonial Congolese cultural heritage metadata.

TheDE-BIAS projectaims to highlight underrepresented voices as a starting point to recontextualise contentious cultural heritage collections. Through co-creation events, crowdsourcing initiatives, the creation of a vocabulary and knowledge graph of contentious terms, and the creation of an online tool to detect biased terms in cultural heritage metadata, DE-BIAS aims to help the cultural heritage sector into the postcolonial era.

Expression and Photography

Gender

Activism

Though we cannot say for certain how figures of the past would identify in contemporary terms, in light of their work, Claude Cahun will be referred to using they/them pronouns throughout this article.

Claude Cahun (b.1894 in Nantes, France) was a French photographer, sculptor, writer and activist now known for iconic works that explore gender identity and sexuality. Born Lucy Schwob, the artist adopted the gender-neutral name Claude Cahun in 1917 as a way of protesting gender and sexual norms. Cahun’s partner in art and in life, Suzanne Malherbe, similarly chose to go by the more gender-neutral Marcel Moore. As Cahun expressed in their collaboration with Moore, Disavowals:

Masculine? Feminine? It depends on the situation. Neuter is the only gender that always suits me.

This exploration of gender was a recurring theme throughout Cahun’s body of work.

Born into a well-off family with deep literary traditions, Cahun contributed to many French publications throughout their life.Taking their first self-portrait in the early 1910s allowed the artist to examine and experiment with gender. Around this time, Cahun tried out various pseudonyms before settling on Claude Cahun – using their grandmother’s maiden name thereby embracing their Jewish heritage while rejecting their father’s prestige.

After attending Sorbonne University, Cahun and Moore settled in Paris together and began hosting artistic and literary ‘salons’ in their shared home.

Attendees included the likes of André Breton, Sylvia Beach and Man Ray. Cahun was also actively involved in the Surrealist movement, founded by Breton, through writing, photography, and theatre. Though a male-dominated group, they were politically aligned with Cahun who drafted texts for and exhibited with them.

Yet, it is the question of gender that Cahun is most recognised for tackling today. Cahun’s self-portraits document their experimentation with gender expression. Donning clothing, makeup and props, they portrayed a cast of characters, blending and subverting masculine and feminine elements. In one of Cahun’s best-known images, their dark fringe is styled into two curls over their forehead reminiscent of a moustache.

There are hearts painted on their lips, cheeks and legs.

A barbell sits on their lap and their shirt is painted with the words “I am in training don’t kiss me” between sewn-on nipples.

Referencing the strongman archetype, Cahun’s pose and costume are at once coquettish and mocking, juxtaposing masculine and feminine stereotypes.

In another well-known, albeit much less theatrical portrait, Cahun poses in front of a mirror – often thought to represent duality and introspection. Mirrors are also associated with vanity, however, in this image, Cahun is turned away from the mirror, looking directly at the viewer as their reflection peers out and away. Here, the artist is bare-faced and has closely cropped hair. The ‘real’ Cahun shields themselves with the lapels of their coat looking vulnerable while their reflection confidently gazes beyond the mirror with their neck purposefully exposed.

Their exploration of gender was not limited to photography. In 1925, Cahun wrote Héroines (Heroines) as a collection of monologues told from the point of view of famous women in literature and history, including Helen of Troy and Sappho. Cahun’s most infamous literary work was the 1930 ‘anti-memoir’ Disavowals. This was a collaboration with Moore that included photomontages and an experimental writing style through which the artist grappled with their own identity and place in the world, including allusions to gender dysphoria. They also translated the sexologist Havelock Ellis’s The Task of Social Hygiene (1912) into French, giving it the subtitle The Woman in Society.

Claude Cahun’s life and art were filled with resistance and defiance. The artist’s shaved head was a clear rejection of the strict gender norms at the time. Discourses surrounding gender and sexuality did not exist in Cahun’s time as they do now, making Cahun and Moore important examples of gender expression and queer relationships. But gender norms were not the only thing Cahun and Moore resisted.

Cahun was of Jewish descent and, in 1937, moved to the island of Jersey together with Moore to escape mounting fascism in mainland Europe. There, they lived together with their cats spending their days making art. However, Nazi occupation brought this idyllic lifestyle to an end. Instead of being evacuated to England, Cahun and Moore embarked on an underground resistance campaign. They wrote leaflets mocking the Nazi regime and lamenting the futility of the war which they signed ‘der Soldat ohne Namen’ (The Nameless Soldier) and left tucked into cigarette packets or under windshield wipers where German soldiers might find them.

They were eventually caught for these activities in 1944 and imprisoned then sentenced to death. They managed to evade this fate when the island was liberated in 1945, and Cahun was subsequently awarded the Medal of French Gratitude in 1951 for their acts of resistance.

Sadly, much of Cahun’s work was lost or destroyed during their prosecution. Their work and their collaborations with Moore were also largely written out of art history until the late 1980s and early 1990s when there was a sudden surge of interest in their art and lives. In 2007, David Bowie curated a multi-media exhibition of Cahun’s work for the Highline Festival in New York and in 2018, Paris named a street in honour of Cahun and Moore. Though often unappreciated and unacknowledged during their own lifetime, queer artists like Claude Cahun have existed throughout history. Thanks to greater awareness and research efforts, we can now celebrate Cahun’s artistry and bravery as an activist and queer icon.

Hi, Ned. Tell us a bit about yourself.

Tell us a bit about how you use Europeana.eu

What has been your best find on Europeana.eu so far?

What are you thinking about at the moment?

Where do you find inspiration?

What plans do you have for Airport Architecture in the future?

Ned Russell uses material from Europeana.eu to share his passion for all things aviation

Ned Russell tells us about his enthusiasm for airport architecture and how material from Europeana.eu helps him to share it with his AvGeek community.

I’m an 'AvGeek' - someone who really likes all things aviation. I’ve been one since I was a young child. I live in Washington DC, and have been an aviation journalist for more than 15 years. I love my job - I get to do a lot of travelling. As such, I’ve flown a lot and been through a lot of airports. Increasingly, I started to think about the architecture of the places I’ve been going through -  what works, what’s good for kids etc. I started to take photos and amassed a collection.

I set up Airport Architecture as an Instagram account around 2018 as a way to express photos I thought were interesting. I try not to give too much of my opinion, just present the architecture and let the commenters add their thoughts.

I started the account with my photos, then photos of friends, then I gained traction and started looking for institutions. That’s what led me to Europeana.eu.

I use Europeana.eu to search for photos and increasingly videos of airport architecture. That takes me down a rabbit hole - I do a generic search for ‘airport’ and then sift through the results. I like to post photos of airports I’m travelling to. If I’m going to Europe, I’ll search for that airport, for example, I went to Munich a few weeks ago.

When I find something on Europeana.eu, I look at the providing institution and see if they have a number of photos, then I’ll go over to their site to see what they have there.

What I love about Europeana.eu is that numerous providing institutions submit photos of the same places. It makes my life easier as I can search multiple providers at once. I’m more familiar with the US photo library system than Europe’s so it’s nice to have a resource like Europeana.eu to use.

My first post usingan item from Europeana.euis this one:

I love the resource, it’s fantastic and a lot of fun. I dive in and always manage to find new stuff. Just the other day I founda video of the Eero Saarinen-designed terminal at Athens Ellinikon airport, which is now not open any more. I posted it straight away.

I love beautiful images from the Jet Age. Europeana.eu led me to the Oslo museum which hasgorgeous photos of Oslo airportin the 1960s. It was the golden age of air travel, and the pictures express its iconic look - its architecture, its people, the international style of the time.

Staying in the Nordics, I love Helsinki Airport. These images are from the era when it first opened. It’s so clean, so simple, it’s what an airport ideally should be - cohesive and just gorgeous. A lot of airports have been expanded over the years and have lost some of that simplicity and truth to architecture. I love seeing these buildings as they initially were when they were planned and seeing what the architect was thinking.

I try to post once a day but it’s hard - I have two kids. My aim is to have a bunch of photos lined up so I can hit ‘post’ and get on with my day. I sit down once a month and search for a couple of hours and build up lots to post.

I have just under 8,000 followers right now and it’s growing. The most successful posts are not always the ones I would think. They are typically something from the 1960s, ‘70s, or ‘80s and something that stands out like contrasts of colour, ‘80s silver cladding, or neon signs. These things look gorgeous in the photos but did not age well!

I like to highlight interesting airports - the mundane is just as important as the star-chitect fabulous buildings. I want to bring the world to these buildings that we all pass through and we don’t think much about (unless they’re terrible).

I was reading a monograph about the Munich airport architect Koch and partner (Munich Airport Terminal 2: Koch + Partner by Christoph Hackelsberger). He put it really well, writing, ‘Airports would be rather mundane places if they were not populated by swarms of passengers, travelers, those in a hurry and those with time to linger.’ It’s true, they would just be buildings if we weren’t travelling through them, running for a flight, or enjoying a cup of coffee. I want to highlight the beautiful and the mundane.

I follow a lot of architecture organisations likeDocomomo, modern architecture advocacy org, I like their posts. I’m a fan of Brutalism feeds likeBrutal House. And I follow prominent architects working on airports today likeLuis Vidal ArchitectsandEvelyn Reid Aeropuertos. Those are the accounts I tend to follow.

I also have an AvGeek community that’s separate from the airport architecture stuff and I have lots of friends who travel and have opinions!

I will keep posting! I recently started aSubstack newsletterwhere I add some commentary to the photos. It’s a place to share the research I’ve done while looking for photographs. What building is this? When did it open? Is it still in operation or demolished? Who was the architect? I learn a lot about these airports, so I started the Substack to share that research.

What are the origins of the Maison Balenciaga?

How was Balenciaga a fashion pioneer?

Balenciaga after Cristóbal

What is the history of the Balenciaga fashion house?

Balenciaga is known today as a global fashion powerhouse brand, led by creative director Demna Gvasalia. The luxury fashion house is very much shaping contemporary style. Its history is more than 100 years old, dating back to a boutique store in Spain.

In this blog, we'll look at the history of the Balenciaga fashion house and explore its enduring appeal.

Before Balenciaga was Cristóbal Balenciaga. Born on January 21, 1895, in the small coastal town of Getaria, in the north ofSpain, Cristóbal Balenciaga emerged as one of the most influential fashion designers of the 20th century.

Balenciaga's mother was a seamstress. From her, he inherited a deep appreciation for textiles and craftsmanship. Soon he began an apprenticeship with a local tailor, where he learned the intricacies of pattern-making, cutting and sewing.

During this formative period, Balenciaga's prodigious talent began to blossom: in an interview in 1968, he declared that at the age of 12 he met the Marchioness of Casa-Torres, who allowed him to make a model for her, and became his first client.

In 1917, Balenciaga moved to Donostia-San Sebastián, where he established his first fashion house at the age of 22.

Despite the challenges of launching a business at a young age and duringWorld War I, his innate talent and dedication to his craft soon garnered attention. Balenciaga's designs were characterised by their impeccable tailoring and construction. They attracted a loyal clientele and laid the foundation for his future success.

However, it was inParis, the epicentre of the fashion world, where Balenciaga's star truly ascended.

In 1937, he opened his eponymous fashion house on Avenue George V. Balenciaga's designs defied convention, blending elements of traditional Spanish couture with avant-garde techniques and modern sensibilities. His mastery of form, silhouette and fabric earned him the admiration of clients and contemporaries alike.

Coco Chanel once said 'Balenciaga alone is a couturier in the truest sense of the word', while Christian Dior described him as 'the master of us all' - establishing him as a leading figure in haute couture.

Throughout his career, Balenciaga was a perfectionist, known for his exacting standards and meticulous attention to detail.

His pioneering use of innovative fabric such as gazar and organza, innovative construction techniques based on traditional tailoring, and approach to silhouette revolutionised the couture industry.

Despite his immense success, Cristóbal Balenciaga was also very private about his personal life. He never married and many rumours were spread about his sexuality.

The two documented relationships he had were with his milliners, Ramon Esparza, and Wladzio Jawrorowski d’Attainville, who many critics described as the love of his life. D’Attainville was a Franco-Polish aristocrat who helped Balenciaga establish his Maison during the 1920s. He died in 1948, and according to journalist Judith Thurman, Balenciaga was so devastated he even considered closing his business, but was persuaded by Christian Dior not to do so.

He eventually closed his Paris salon in 1968, largely due to the changing fashion landscape and his desire to maintain the integrity of his work in the face of evolving industry pressures.

His retirement marked the end of an era in fashion, but his legacy lived on through the countless designers he inspired and the enduring impact of his visionary creations.

Following his departure, the brand experienced several changes in creative direction and ownership.

In the 1970s and 1980s, the brand struggled to maintain its previous prominence. However, in the 1990s, it underwent a revival under the leadership of designerNicolas Ghesquière, who injected new energy and creativity into Balenciaga's collections.

In 2001, Balenciaga was acquired by the French luxury conglomerate Kering. Under the creative direction of designers like Nicolas Ghesquière,Alexander Wang, and most notably, Demna Gvasalia, Balenciaga regained its status as one of the most influential and innovative fashion houses in the world.

What are the Ancient Greek roots of democracy?

How equality became part of democracies

What is the European Union and what does it do?

Voting in the European elections

Discover educational resources about democracy and democratic values in Europe

There are many challenges threatening democracy in Europe today.

Therefore, it is crucial for us all to know and learncompetences for democratic cultureso that we do not forget the past and reinforce the values that make us live in democratic societies.

In this blog, we explore from an educational perspective the history of democracy in Europe with its lights and shadows, the values that make us Europeans and the European institutions that represent the citizens.

The word democracy is derived from the Greek worddemokratia. This word comes fromdemos, meaning people, andkratosmeaning power. Thus, democracy is defined as the system of government in which power is exercised directly or indirectly by the people.

Democracy was established inGreecein the 5th century BC, where the city of Athens had a direct democracy. In other words, people directly made decisions by voting for aspects of the city's government.

It was limited to a small part of the population - only 50,000 men could vote, out of a population of more than 300,000 people. This differs from our democracies today. After historical struggles, these are open to the largest possible electorate by indirect voting. where we elect representatives to defend our interests in parliamentary seats.

Democracy in Athens took the shape and form of the theatre. Dialogues and debates were conducted on a stage, where the citizens situated in thetheatron(a semi-circular seated space similar to our present-day parliaments) could listen and also intervene. Theatre spaces in Ancient Greece were not only restricted to tragedies and  comedies, but to any event in the city.

Despite being limited to a small group of people, there were still those who did not care enough to participate in these democratic processes. InAncient Greece, they were defined as 'idiots' - 'a private person' who was ignorant of public affairs. This recognised that a democratic society can survive as long as its members participate in it.

Parliamentary democracy emerged with the Cortes of León, a parliamentary body in the Kingdom of León in the 12th century.  In the 18th century, the French Revolution and, in the 19th century, the birth of the modern state led to democracies in Europe spreading. During the first quarter of the 20th century,democratic rights and freedomsin Europe became stronger.

From then until  World War II and beyond, in some countries, waves of anti-democratic movements such as Italian or Spanish fascism, German national socialism or communism in Eastern Europe reduced the progress achieved years earlier.

Nevertheless, during these periods, people likeWillem Arondéus,Rosa Luxemburg,Jesse OwensandLouise Weiss(among others) stand out as providing moments of light in these periods of darkness.

In many countries, long periods of protest took place before important rights - such asuniversal suffrage,equal rights for LGBTQI+ communitiesor equality between people regardless of their race, gender, religion, sexual or ability - could become real.

Many people throughout history who were discriminated against, currently embody thedemocratic valuesof the Europe where we want to live. Examples are the values embodied by characters who had adisabilitysuch as Ludwig van Beethoven, Louis Braille, Mileva Marić or Francisco de Goya that makes us reflect on equality and diversity that helps us to have a better future.

Although countries in Europe govern themselves, today most of them are organised within an alliance called the European Union.

The origin of this community of countries lies in the Schuman Declaration of 1950, which established the European Coal and Steel Community. In 1958, when other countries joined the community, they established the European Parliament. Decade after decade, more countries joined this alliance to become what we know today as the European Union.

As an alliance, the European Union established symbols such as the European flag with stars over a blue background or the European Anthem from Herbert von Karajan’s arrangement of Beethoven’sOde to the Joyfrom his 9th Symphony.

The European Union has three main institutions: the European Commission based in Brussels and Luxembourg, the European Parliament in Brussels, Strasbourg and Luxembourg and the Council of the European Union in Brussels.

The European Commission is responsible for proposing and implementing EU law as the executive branch. The European parliament represents the interests of EU citizens and discusses and approves EU regulations. The Council of the European Union represents the interests of the countries that shape Commission proposals and adopts them.

Every five years, European Union citizenselect Members of the European Parliament(MEPs). A total of 720 MEPs are elected. The last time was in 2019 and this year, elections will be held from 6-9 June.

Elections take place in a four-day period, with each country running the elections to their own processes. Every EU citizen can vote and stand for election. The number of MEPs elected from a political party is proportional to the number of votes it receives.

After elections, MEPs organised in political groups elect a President. In a subsequent session, they elect a new President of the European Commission and approve the full College of Commissioners.

It is important for every EU citizen to vote in these elections as MEPS influence all aspects of lives in the European Union around rights, law and also approve budgets. So it is so important to know how European democracy works and how this shapes the institutions of the European Union.

Narcisa Amália the activist

Narcisa Amália the feminist

Narcisa Amália the translator

Narcisa Amália’s legacy

A beacon of the Brazilian intellectual scene

Narcisa Amália de Oliveira Campos left an indelible mark on the literary and socio-political landscape of her time. She shattered social norms as the first professional female journalist in Brazil, and made exceptional contributions as an intellectual, journalist, poet, translator and abolitionist. This year marks the 100th anniversary of her death.

Born on 3 April  1856, in São João da Barra, Narcisa Amália de Oliveira Campos was the daughter of Brazilian writer Joaquim Jácome de Oliveira Campos Filho and primary school teacher Narcisa Inácia de Campos. At the age of 11, she relocated to the picturesque city of Resende, which she came to adore. Her father played a pivotal role in her education, imparting to her his knowledge of languages and philosophy.

She was married twice, first to the artist João Batista da Silveira and later to the baker Francisco Cleto da Rocha. Both marriages ended in divorce. During her second marriage, she faced defamation from her husband, who falsely accused her of not writing her own poetry and instead attributed it to her alleged lovers. This defamation compelled her to leave the city of Resende, her beloved hometown, and relocate to the Brazilian capital, Rio de Janeiro.

In Rio de Janeiro, she pursued a career as a teacher and continued her work in journalism. She contributed to the magazineA leitura(Reading), where she was employed from 1894 to 1896.

Narcisa Amália’s  literary journey began with fervent activism against slavery, supported through her first book,Nebulosas(Nebulae). In this groundbreaking work, she highlighted the crucial role of the press in the fight against slavery, challenging entrenched systems of oppression.

Beyond her literary prowess, Narcisa Amália was an unwavering force in the abolitionist movement, collaborating with fellow activists like Maria Firmina dos Reis (who is considered Brazil's first black female novelist and the author of the first Brazilian abolitionist novel) in challenging racist ideologies and advocating for social justice.

In an era dominated by patriarchal structures, when women's voices were often silenced, Narcisa Amália emerged as a symbol of resilience and empowerment. She is viewed as a foremother in her country's feminist movement.

Despite a literary landscape dominated by male figures, Narcisa Amália challenged conventions and carved out her space as a prolific poet and writer. Her verses were imbued with themes of emancipation, love, and social change, reflecting the aspirations and struggles of a generation yearning for liberation.

However, her journey was riddled with challenges, emblematic of the social obstacles confronted by women during her era. Controversy arose with the publication ofNebulosaswhen her authorship was disputed, wrongly attributed to a male pseudonym. Undeterred, Narcisa Amália persevered, reclaiming her rightful place in the annals of Brazilian literary history.Nebulosaswas first published in 1872 and reissued in 2017 by Gradiva Editorial and the Fundação Biblioteca Nacional, and garnered significant acclaim upon its release. It was widely praised by renowned Brazilian writer Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis and even caught the attention of Pedro II, the Brazilian monarch.

Through works such as “Miragem” (Mirage), Nelumbia, and O Romance da Mulher que Amou (The Romance of the Woman Who Loved), she wielded her pen as a powerful tool for change, inspiring generations to challenge injustice and strive for a fairer society.

In her work,A Mulher do Século XIX(Women of the Nineteenth Century), she issued a clear call for gender equality, urging women to assert their worth and demand their rightful place in society. Her advocacy reverberated throughout Brazil, igniting lively discussions on women's empowerment and laying the groundwork for future generations of activists.

Today, Narcisa Amália's legacy endures as a testament to the power of literature to incite social change and elevate marginalised voices. Critical analyses of her work, such as Christine Ramalho'sUm espelho para Narcisa: Reflexos de uma voz romantica(A Mirror for Narcisa: Reflections of a Romantic Voice), provide deep insights into her life and lasting influence, ensuring that her contributions continue to inspire and resonate with contemporary audiences.

Amalia's translation work should not be neglected either. She translated the work of George Sand, who inspired her in both her literary and activist endeavours. She also translated the work of Gaston de Saporta, a French aristocrat, palaeobotanist and non-fiction writer.

Narcisa Amalia's legacy extends beyond her advocacy for women's rights. She was also a pioneer in challenging societal norms regarding gender roles and expectations. Through her actions and words, she encouraged women to break free from traditional constraints and pursue their passions and ambitions.

In addition to her activism, Narcisa Amalia was a symbol of resilience and courage in the face of adversity. She confronted prejudice, discrimination, and backlash with grace and determination, never wavering in her commitment to the cause she believed in. Her unwavering spirit continues to inspire activists and changemakers around the world to this day.

In honouring Narcisa Amalia's memory, it is essential not only to celebrate her achievements but also to heed the lessons of her life. Her legacy serves as a reminder of the ongoing struggle for gender equality and the importance of collective action in effecting meaningful change. As we pay tribute to her remarkable contributions, let us recommit ourselves to the pursuit of justice, equality, and human rights for all.

What miracles did Saint Isidore perform?

How is Saint Isidore celebrated?

How is Saint Isidore related to the Spanish monarchy?

Who was San Isidro, the patron saint of Madrid?

Saint Isidore is the patron saint of Madrid, where he lived and died. Born around 1082, he was a peasant who worked his lord’s land as a tenant in exchange for rent, as was normal at this time.

Saint Isidore is also considered the patron saint of farmers and rural communities. He is often pictured in peasant clothing, carrying the tools needed to work the fields. Sometimes he is portrayed next to springs of water or fountains, as well as his oxen, alluding to the miracles he is said to have made.

In Isidore’s time, Madrid and the land around it belonged to one of the independent Muslim kingdoms formed after the dissolution of the Caliphate of Cordoba.

His family was likely Mozarab, which meant that they kept their Christian faith even though they lived in Muslim territory. The area would return to Christianity in 1085, shortly after he was born after Alfonso VI besieged its capital, Toledo.

The saint's life and miracles are found in theCodex of Saint Isidore, which dates from the 13th century.

The text narrates how he would often miraculously multiply food for those less fortunate, as well as for his fellow field workers and birds that suffered from the lack of food in winter. It is also said that his oxen could plough the fields on their own while he prayed, so he never lost a day of work.

Other tales of his miracles have survived thanks to oral tradition.

The most well-known among them is the miracle of the fountain. One summer day, Saint Isidore's lord was thirsty, so, using one of his farming tools, the saint made a fountain spring from the ground where they stood.

He is said to have had an exceptional skill to find water sources and wells, and thus it is common to ask him for rain in springtime.

Every year, on May 15, the feast of Saint Isidore (Fiesta de San Isidro) is celebrated in Madrid with a pilgrimage to his temple.

There, people drink water from his fountain, which has been previously blessed, eat pastries, dress as achulapaorchulapo(like in the poster below), and dance thechotis, the traditional dance of Madrid.

Saint Isidore is also the patron saint of other Spanish towns, like Rosal de la Frontera, in Huelva, or La Orotava, in Tenerife. He is also worshipped in other parts of the world, such as Honduras, Argentina and the Philippines.

Saint Isidore's remains are located in the Collegiate Church that bears his name, alongside those of his wife, Saint Mary of the Head. She receives the name 'of the Head' because her skull was venerated as a relic in Torrelaguna, where it is said she was born.

According to popular belief, Saint Isidore and Saint Mary had a son, Illán, who, unlike his parents, is not considered an official saint by the Catholic Church. However, he is worshipped like a saint in some towns such as Cebolla, in Toledo, where he is believed to have settled and worked his miracles.

Saint Isidore is also closely related to the Spanish monarchy. All the royal houses have worshipped the saint, believing, especially, in his healing powers.

His body has been taken out in procession and prayed to as a way to ask for help in cases of illness or imminent death of a member of the royal family. This was the case of Mariana of Neuburg and Maria Amalia of Saxony, both queens consort of Spain.

It is also said that King Felipe II was cured of an illness after drinking from a spring believed to be the same Saint Isidore made appear for his lord.

As a way to thank the saint, Felipe’s mother, Isabel of Portugal, ordered a hermitage to be built in that place, which is now known as 'la Pradera de San Isidro' (Saint Isidore’s meadow).

Hi, Jack and Mark. Tell us a bit about yourselves.

We have to ask - why bums?

How do you use Europeana.eu?

What has been your best find on Europeana.eu?

What are you thinking about at the moment?

Where do you find inspiration?

What plans do you have for Museum Bums in the future?

Mark Small and Jack Shoulder’s 'Museum Bums' uses statues and artworks to explore public and social histories.

‘Museum Bums’ started out on social media, grew into a thriving online community and at the end of 2023, became a print book. We talk to its authors.

Jack: I live in Bristol, UK. I’ve worked in museums, galleries and cultural spaces since 2010. I work for a young people’s mental health charity, and in my spare time, I coordinate LGBTQ+ tours at the V&A. I love finding ways to get people excited about history, and looking at the past with fresh eyes. I like to explore what we can understand better, what evidence can be challenged, and what our assumptions are.

Mark: I also live in Bristol, and worked in a national heritage charity on youth empowerment projects. Then I moved to Bristol Museum and Bristol Archives. I’m interested in public history - making it accessible, available and interesting, trying to tell stories in interesting ways. I now work at Bristol Register Office and I like to include some cultural heritage when I can - for example next year we’ll celebrate the 200th anniversary of the building we’re based in. And together, Jack and I have written a book aboutMuseum Bums!

Jack: Bums are universal. They get people talking, they’re a bit cheeky - in art and sculpture, bums are often overlooked - we tend to focus on the face and the front. So when we look at bums, we’re looking at things from a different perspective. We find out more about how an object or artwork was supposed to be displayed, what the artist wanted us to see, whether the artist was good at proportions and posture. Bums are a way in to exploring art and art history in a way that is fun and a bit silly, but can really get people thinking.

In about 2013, we started putting pictures on our own social media of bums from statues we saw in museums. We were getting some attention, so in 2016 we decided to team up and established Museum Bums onTwitterandInstagram.

In the book, there’s also a series of essays exploring bums through various lenses like a feminist lens, or a queer lens. Even questions like ‘Why are so many people at the beach in these paintings?’

Mark: Bums are ubiquitous. You can go into any gallery or cultural space and there will be a bum somewhere. The Polar Museum in Cambridge has abronze statuein its grounds by Captain Scott’s widow and modelled on the young brother of Lawrence of Arabia. At the British Library, you can find bums in atlases, in constellation maps, as a popular decorative feature. They cross time too -  neolithic fertility statutes, 20th centuryHenry Moore statues, Japanese art that includes the story of theKappa, a mythological creature you can fend off by farting in its face.

Jack: I think around 10% of the images in the Museum Bums book are sourced from Europeana.eu. During lockdown, our online community grew - people would send us a grainy picture of something they’d seen and want to know more about it. We’d use our research skills to work out what it was. Amazing resources like Europeana.eu really helped.  Europeana is a great source of rich information. So if there is sparse information on Wikimedia, for example, we know we can go to Europeana.eu for a breadth of collections and information that helps us piece together what people are sending us. We then share it back to them with our new information.

Mark: We like to share things in a jokey way but sneak in some art history research. We know people are scrolling Instagram on the bus, and we want them to go ‘Ha!’ but also ‘Ah!’

Jack: This year we wanted to do a social media post for Mother’s Day in the UK, and using Europeana.eu, we found a shot from the filmThe Mother. It’s really hard to find something that is so specific - maternal images tend to focus on the front of the body or a mother and child. Being able to find something that specific really worked for our brand.

Mark: In 2020, we trawled Europeana for Olympic-themed bums. One of our favourites we used on our socials was at the Swedish Olympic Stadium.The statuehas two figures running through the main entrance. I loved how the juxtaposition of art, culture, sport and international events all came together.

Jack: Photo manipulation has been on my mind as there have been conspiracy theories about the Princess of Wales editing a family photo. I’m thinking about how we are receiving images and how they can be manipulated. And the fact that people are developing critical thinking about what we’re seeing on the internet. We’re thinking ‘Is this fake or real?’

Mark: I have been thinking about the Oscars! We went to the Barbican to see anexhibition of costumesfrom the film Poor Things. The storytelling that people did with the outfits is incredible.We saw the film at an indie cinema, then going to the exhibition really extended the experience.

Mark: During lockdown, museums and archives used their social media accounts as their main way to engage with people.Orkney Library’s social media was very good at finding a random object and saying this is why it’s interesting.The National Library of Scotlandalso did really fun social media that wasn’t necessarily about their collections, but you learned something.

Jack:Suzy Dentand her word of the day always cheer me up. And I like the website that tells ushow many people are in space.

Mark: I like theNASA picture of the day. It reminds me that we’re tiny and insignificant.

Jack: We’re doing a lot of work on events with UK museums, such as tours and talks with organisations like V&A Dundee, Dundee University as part of Dundee Pride celebrations as well as working with Leeds City Museum and on events in Liverpool. We’ve also got plans for book two, and possibly book three. We’ve still got plenty to say about bums.

Mark: With events like this, we get a chance to highlight what’s not there - what people have decided isn’t important in art. In Liverpool with the Walker Art Gallery, we’re doing a drawing event where the life models are people of colour or people who don’t have normative bodies. We want to make the point that there are galleries and collections full of white bodies, but that’s not representative of everyone. A lot of art is based on Greek and Roman art and a pursuit of perfect proportions. But bodies are messy and they aren’t perfect.

Sculpting across Europe

Vukosava’s personal notebook

Vukosava in World War II

Unveiling the legacy of Vukosava Velimirović

Serbian women have long exemplified creativity, leaving indelible marks on the nation's cultural history. Among these remarkable individuals stands Vukosava Velimirović, the pioneering figure hailed as the first Serbian sculptor. Yet, her legacy remains relatively obscure within her homeland, despite earning recognition in various foreign encyclopaedias.

Throughout her life, Velimirović grappled with the dual nature of her creative fervour - a source of both empowerment and burden. In an era when women's involvement in the arts was often frowned upon or deemed unfeminine, she courageously navigated these societal constraints, steadfastly asserting her right to contribute to the cultural landscape.

Vukosava Velimirović's journey took her across numerous European capitals, where she not only honed her craft but also engaged with influential figures on both local and global stages. Despite her prolific output and encounters with greatness, her name gradually faded from memory as time marched on.
Today, as we reflect on the rich tapestry of Serbian cultural heritage, it's imperative to shed light on Velimirović's invaluable contributions. Her story serves as a poignant reminder of the resilience and determination exhibited by women in pursuit of their artistic passions, transcending barriers and leaving an enduring legacy for generations to come.

Vukosava Velimirović was born in 1888 in Pirot, in a large family to father Miloš and mother Jelena, who was a teacher. She received her primary education in Pirot, primarily growing up in an intellectual and patriarchal family. It is recorded that Vukosava showed an interest in art from her earliest youth, especially writing and drawing, but also modelling. She wrote poems, fairy tales, travelogues, drew comics for children, made various shapes from clay and thus confirmed that her life’s path will be marked by art.

In 1911, Vuka Velimirović's family moved to Belgrade. Enrolling in the School of Arts and Crafts marked the beginning of her artistic journey in the Serbian capital. Renowned for her beauty, Vuka stood out among her peers, who collectively formed an extraordinary generation of schoolgirls, leaving a lasting imprint on Serbian cultural history. Notably, her talent for sculpture was recognised early on by her professor, the renowned Đorđe Jovanović, shaping her artistic career thereafter.

Following the First World War, she relocated to the artistic epicentre of Paris. Upon her arrival in Paris, Vuka became a student in the studio of the renowned French sculptor Antoine Bourdelle, who was equally captivated by her talent, much like the esteemed Serbian artists who had known her.

In an issue of the magazine ’Word and Image’ from 1926, Bourdelle expressed his admiration, stating, ’I am happy to once again affirm the intellectual and artistic prowess of the Serbian nation.’ He further praised Vuka Velimirović, likening her sculptural talent to that of the Serbian masters, noting the strength of her busts and the radiance of her faces. Her dedication to her artistic studies in Paris earned her recognition, and Bourdelle considered it an honour to have witnessed her work.

Under the mentorship of the renowned French sculptor, Vuka Velimirović gained entry into the prestigious Academy of Fine Arts in Paris, where she trained from 1919 to 1921. Her initial days in Paris were enriched by connections with Russian refugee artists, many of whom were acquaintances of her brother, Dr. Milorad Velimirović, and her sister Zorka, a Russian translator. This circle comprised writers, actors, opera singers, and ballet dancers, forming an elite community. Inspired by these friendships, Vuka conceived the idea to sculpt busts of Georgy Yevgenyevich Prince Lvov, former president of the Russian government, and the renowned Russian ballet dancer Anna Pavlova.

Vuka Velimirović's captivating artistic presence and sculpting prowess won acclaim in France, as evidenced by an excerpt from a ‘Figaro’ article: ‘Her powerful expressiveness and charm, captivating viewers, establish her among today's foremost sculptors. Traveling the world, she left true masterpieces in many lands, yet we hope France will be privileged to preserve the legacy of her immortal art...’

As an already established sculptor, Vuka Velimirović left Paris for Rome, where she also tried to perfect her sculpting skills. It was in Rome that Vukosava Velimirović's brilliant sculpting career began. She studied further at the Art Academy there, but also at Eton Ferrari's studio. During that period, she worked on the bust of the famous Italian baritone Mattia Battistini. It was this bust that would bring her world fame.

What the Serbian sculptor was known for were numerous trips to European countries where she left her artistic mark. Thus, in France, she portrayed the rich Russian emigration, the French nobility, and artists such as the famous bass Fyodor Chaliapin, and the singer and dancerJosephine Baker. In Spain, she made portraits of marquises and intellectuals, and in Turkey, at the invitation of Ataturk, she made his portrait, which was followed by an offer for a monument to the Republic of Turkey, which was never implemented. Vukosava is the creator of sculptural compositions on the house of the Veljković family, which was used by the Turkish embassy, and which was declared a cultural monument.

Vuka is also the artist behind a bust of Vincent de Moro-Giafferi, a famous Parisian politician and lawyer who was known as a lawyer for the poor.

Vuka exhibited this bust for the first time in 1926 in the Georges Petit Gallery (Galerie Georges Petit), along with several other busts, mostly of prominent Serbs, such as Miroslav Spalajković, the Yugoslav minister in Paris, and industrialist Đorđe Vajfert. Three of her sculptures cast in bronze are also famous, showing her extraordinary talent and distinctive sculptural expression.

The recently discovered memorial notebook of Vuka Velimirović sheds light on previously obscure aspects of her life. Within its pages, readers can delve into her vibrant artistic and social circles, her connections with European and international artists, her marriage to Count Martineri, her intriguing encounters with figures like the Indian poet Tagore and Tolstoy's daughter Tatiana Suhotin, and the admiration she garnered as a student of sculptor Alfred Pina.

Notably, Vuka is the second Serbian woman known to have captivated the Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore, following in the footsteps of Serbian writer, feminist, and adventurer Jelena J. Dimitrijević, who was among the few women to visit Tagore in Santiniketan and later penned the acclaimed ‘Letters from India’ based on her experiences.

Although she spent a portion of her life abroad, Vuka Velimirović consistently remained a representative of her country and culture. Therefore, upon the outbreak of World War II, she made the decision to return to Serbia to stand alongside her people amidst the German occupation and the horrors of war.

Her visits to Paris were limited, occurring only once after the war, where she confronted the stark reality that much of her work had either vanished or been destroyed. She lived out her remaining years in the Serbian capital, exhibiting her art until her passing in 1965 at a very old age. Her burial at the New Cemetery was modest, with little public attention, as newspapers of that era scarcely covered her death.

Where does the word brandy come from?

Where does gin come from?

What is the meaning of the word rum?

What is the etymology of vodka?

How did whiskey get its name?

Alcoholic drinks are part of European life, part of how we celebrate good times on special occasions. The alcoholic drinks industry is a substantial multi-million pound industry in Europe, with many major manufacturers.

Did you know that many of these drinks get their name from European languages? This blog looks at the etymology of some of the most popular alcoholic spirits.

Brandy is a shortened form of an older English word 'brandywine', which itself derived from a Dutch wordbrandewijn, meaning 'burnt wine'.

This term refers to the process of distilling wine to increase its alcohol content, which results in the creation of brandy.

Brandy is believed to have originated in wine-producing regions of France in the 12th century.

Over time, brandy production spread across Europe, with various countries - such asSpain,ItalyandPortugal- developing their own unique styles and methods.

Gin has its origins in the Dutch wordjeneverorgenever, which means juniper.

This word reflects gin's distinctive flavour, which is primarily derived from juniper berries during the distillation process.

Originally developed inthe Netherlandsin the 17th century, gin is now produced all across Europe with many varieties and flavours.

Rum is a spirit that is drunk across the globe. It is associated with parts of the world where sugarcane grows.

However, there is no consensus as to where the name rum comes from. Some sources suggest it derives its name from the Latin wordsaccharum, a species of sugarcane. Others suggest that it is related to 'rumbullion', a beverage made from boiling sugar cane stalks.

Both of these theories reflects the historical association of rum with sugar production, as it was originally distilled from sugar cane by-products.

The etymology of the word 'vodka' is rooted in Slavic languages.

The word 'vodka' is derived from the Slavic wordvoda, meaning water. The addition of the diminutive-kamakes the name 'little water'.

Historians do not agree on the origins of vodka as a drink. The first written mention of the word was in Polish, as the wordwódka. This was in court documents from 1405.

Vodka production is associated withPoland, Russia and many other countries across eastern Europe, as well asSweden.

Depending on the geographic origin of the drink, the word whiskey is spelled differently. Whiskey - with an e - is the word for whiskey fromIrelandand the United States. Meanwhile, whisky fromScotlandand other countries is spelled without the letter e.

The name 'whiskey' derives from the Gaelic worduiscewhich means 'water'. In Irish, this is now written asuisce, while in Scottish Gaelic it's written asuisge.

The phraseuisce beatheoruisge beathamean 'water of life', which come from the Latin phrase 'aqua vitae' which applied to all distilled alcohol.

The Gaelic term was anglicised touskebeaghe,usquebaughand eventually shortened to simply 'whiskey'.

Genevieve

Héloïse

Marianne

Gertrude Stein

Exploring stories of remarkable women in Paris

There is a well-known film documentary (produced in 1996) entitledParis Was A Woman. It celebrates famous women in Paris between World War I and World War II.

One might extend this premise to include both the city as woman and render some of her other famous women from the past a voice, as evidence of the verisimilitude (representation) of this title.

The beauty of Paris is embodied in her architecture from ancient to modern times, imbued with lines and curves and magnificent spires. Ornately decorated buildings and colourful gardens reflect the artistry of those that built her.

Paris was the home of such women as her patron saint Genevieve, Christine de Pizan - the first woman to be paid for her writing - and Héloïse, the famous nun andwoman of lettresof the 12th century.

Paris is also known for contemporary women from the 20th and 21st century such as philosophers Simone de Beauvoir and Hélene Cixous and, of course, the famous fashion designerCoco Chanel.

Paris has played host to these remarkable women who have left their spirit in a city that, like them, reflects grace, intelligence and courage. Paris provided a space for her women to create, to think and to act - despite the political, economic and social restrictions that historically made their voices and work often invisible.

Let us take a look at a few of the many great women ofParis.

Genevieve, a Gallo-Roman woman of noble birth, was the patron saint of Paris. She lived in the 5th century, and was instrumental in saving Paris from the invading armies of Attila the Hun (ruler of the nomadic Huns people).

Paris's townspeople were at first sceptical of Genevieve's motives, as she was a descendant of what they considered to be 'outsiders'. She gave good advice to the people of Paris for the women to not flee but to stay and pray- this saved them from slaughter.

Respect for her advice succeeded in securing her place as a wise and honourable woman saint of Paris. Later, a church was erected in her name where her relics are buried.

Themedieval periodproduced a number of great women thinkers, writers, composers, theologians, and artists. Héloïse of Paris was one such woman. She was a revolutionary thinker in the field of theology and the way(s) it was interpreted by church scholars.

Her critical considerations were respected by her private tutor, Abélard, a cleric, who proclaimed in a letter to her:

I am inferior to you in every way, because you surpass me even where I seemed to surpass you

He saw her as a person of intelligence. They later became passionate lovers which led to a rather tragic end for both of them.

The love they expressed was not considered appropriate - Héloïse and Abelard could not legally marry since clerical marriage was forbidden. They did, however, marry secretly and had a child together. Héloïse was not able to raise her own child, Astrolabe. He was put in the care of Abelard's sister, Dionysia.

Abelard insisted Heloise should spend the rest of her days cloistered from society as he did himself. The separation was painful for two people who so deeply loved one another. She remained in his mind and he in hers.

Through their letters to one another, we see a love that burned bright despite their separation. Ultimately, we remember Héloïse as a woman of great learning and grace, who loved Abelard to the end. They are buried together in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

Marianne is the allegorical symbol of a widerFrance, representing the tenets of French political ideals such as liberty, equality, fraternity and reason.

It becomes quite clear, therefore, that there is little wonder Paris is imagined as a woman. Marianne takes her place among other goddesses of reason and intelligence, such as the Roman goddess Minerva or the Greek goddess Athena - at once fierce and wise women.

She was not a real person, however. She is imagined as real in various forms: paintings, marble busts, memorials and statues as the one found in Paris.

Paris has also embraced women from outside of France who came to the city in search of support for their intellectual and artistic work.

One of the most notable was Gertrude Stein who, in Paris, founded an avant-garde movement that spoke to her own artistic thinking about the structure of literature - that challenged late 19th century notions of style, content and language. It was also a place that accepted what would have been considered an alternative lifestyle.

Stein lived there with her life-long partner Alice B. Toklas and nurtured many modernist writers. American writers Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald as well as artists such as Spanish painter Pablo Picasso and French painter Henri Matisse gathered at her salon.

The salons of Paris were places where women might test the acceptance and appreciation of their artistic work. Stein established her own salon that supported her, Alice B. Toklas and others in their own artistic endeavours.

It is in the establishment of such places that we see her innovative drive to continue the tradition of supporting women - one that the city of Paris offered to her. She is famous for saying

America is my country, and Paris is my hometown.

She and Alice remained in France even through the turmoil and deprivation of theWorld War II.

After the war, they both returned to their beloved city of Paris where they continued their work. Stein wroteWars I Have Seenthe year before her death in 1946. Like Héloïse and Abélard, Gertrude Stein and her partner Alice B. Toklas are buried together in the Pére Lachaise Cemetery.

Many more women artists, writers, philosophers, scientists and innovators benefitted from the gifts of Paris. The city of Paris is indeed a woman: a place where women did and can today still find solace, support, and inspiration for their work.

In celebration of all the contributions women have made to human history, the city of Paris should be counted among those who have offered women an opportunity to, as Simone de Beauvoir said,become a woman.

Partisan, pioneer and politician of the European Union

Leonilde Iotti, known as Nilde was born in Reggio Emilia, Italy on 10 April 1920, into an anti-fascist family, persecuted by the fascist regime. Her father Egidio, a railway worker, was fired because of his socialist ideas and his subsequent commitment as a trade unionist.

When her father died in 1934, Nilde’s family faced considerable economic difficulties. This however did not prevent her from being a brilliant student. She obtained a scholarship that allowed her to enrol at the Catholic University of Milan where she graduated in Literature and Philosophy in 1942.

She distanced herself from religious faith precisely during her university studies.

I rationally said no to belief, because it was absurd.

After the armistice of Cassibile on 8 September 1943 during the Second World War, she participated in the Resistance. Initially she participated as a courier, then joining the Women's Defense Groups, an anti-fascist formation of the Italian Communist Party, becoming a leading figure.
In 1946 she finally joined the Italian Communist Party.

That same year Nilde was a candidate and elected member of the Constituent Assembly, in which she was one of the 75 members of the Committee responsible for drafting the Italian Constitution.

During this time, she began an affair with Palmiro Togliatti, an economist, journalist and politician, who led the Italian Communist Party from 1927 until his death in 1964. Palmiro was married to Rita Montagnana, who was also a member of the Constituent Assembly.

Nilde joined the Chamber of Deputies in 1948, and sat in Palazzo Montecitorio (the seat of the Chamber of Deputies) continuously until 1999.

In 1963, she was part of the Constitutional Affairs Commission, focusing her activity on the relevance of women’s roles in the world of work and family relations.

Nilde committed herself to the reform of civil laws. This included the recognition of children born out of wedlock and the introduction of divorce into the legal system, winning in 1974 the abrogative referendum (popular referendum) wanted by Catholics and Christian Democrats.

The Communist participation in the European Parliament happened for the first time in 1969. Nilde was part of the first Italian delegation and committed herself to the promulgation (enactment) of the law on direct European suffrage.

Nilde remained a deputy until the first direct elections in 1979.
At the opening of the Legislature VIII of Italy, she was elected President of the Chamber of Deputies, a role she held from 1979 to 1992. In her inauguration speech she placed women in society at the centre:

I myself, I won't hide it from you, I experience this moment almost emblematically, sensing in it a profound meaning that goes beyond myself and affects millions of women who, through tiring, patient and persistent struggles, have opened the way towards their emancipation.

Nilde resigned from all duties on 18 November, 1999 due to serious health problems. She received a standing ovation by The Chamber of Deputies at her resignation. 
On 4 December 1999, she died in Poli, near Rome. Nilde was honoured with a civil rite because she was an atheist. She is buried in Rome, at the Verano Cemetery.

We must humanise work, the rhythm of life. We must introduce into politics the everyday experiences, the small details of life, forcing everyone - politicians, ministers, economists, local administrators - to finally come to terms with the actual lives of women.

Discover the works of these influential female authors

Women's contributions to literature across Europe have often been overlooked.

This blog looks at six female writers from across Europe, who have left a mark on the world of literature.

Matilde Serao was a journalist and novelist. She was born in Greece, and moved toItalyin her childhood. She was the first woman to edit an Italian newspaper and, in 1904, her own newspaperIl Giorno.

Serao was the author of several novels, and was nominated for the Nobel Prize for Literature six times. In 1916, she publishedParla una donna, a collection of articles which had been originally published in her newspaper - these looked at women's experiences in Italy duringWorld War I.

'…Esso non è uscito dalla penna di una scrittrice: in esso, parla una donna. Non vi troverai nessuna veste letteraria: ma vi sentirai, io spero, io credo, la sincerità di un vivo ma contenuto dolore, il fervore di una immensa speranza.'

'…do not be deceived about what this book is. It did not come from the pen of a writer: in it, a woman speaks. You will not find any literary guise in it: but you will feel, I hope, I believe, the sincerity of a lively but contained pain, the fervour of an immense hope.'

Jelena J. Dimitrijević was Serbia’s first feminist author. Born in Kruševac in centralSerbiain 1862, she was well-educated until an eye injury forced her to quit school. Doctors even forbade her from reading or writing!

Dimitrijević ignored their advice, and continued her education. Over her lifetime, she learned to speak English, French, German, Greek, Russian and Turkish.

At the beginning of the20th century, she moved to Belgrade, where she quickly became a prolific writer and a member of the Serbian Writers’ Society. Over the next forty years, she travelled extensively and wrote: she published poetry, novels and travelogues.

'…šta bi bilo od žena - putnica? Jer za muškarce - putnike, ili bar za nekog od njih našla bi se neka Kalipsa, ako ne bi našli svi u moru grob. Nisam čula još ni za jednog boga koji bi spašavao žene - putnice prilikom brodoloma; niti sam čitala o ijednom bogu koji bi ih posle katastrofe zadržavao u svojoj pećini.'

'…what would become of women travellers? Because for men travellers, or at least for one of them, some Calypso would be found - if not, all of them would find a grave in the sea. I have not yet heard of any god who would save women passengers during a shipwreck; nor did I read about any god who would keep them in his cave after the disaster.'

Swedish author Selma Lagerlöf was the first woman to win aNobel prizein literature, which she was awarded in 1909.

Lagerlof was born in 1858 in westernSweden. She worked initially as a teacher between 1885 to 1895, while writing her first novelGösta Berling's Sagawhich was published in 1891.

The novel's success attracted financial support, which allowed her to concentrate on writing. In the early 20th century, Lagerlöf was prolific, publishing many plays, novels and short stories. Her Nobel Prize was awarded for her 'lofty idealism, vivid imagination, and spiritual perception that characterise her writings'.

From 1894, Lagerlöf was in a relationship with Sophie Elkan, also a Swedish writer. Their writings suggest a deep emotional bond between them. However, as homosexuality was taboo between women, neither publicly revealed their relationship.

'För så länge det finns intressanta böcker att läsa, tycker jag inte att varken jag själv eller någon annan behöver vara olycklig.'

'So long as there are interesting books to read, it seems to me that neither I nor anyone else, for that matter, need be unhappy.'

Carolina Coronado was a Spanish writer and poet of the Romantic period in the 19th century.

She was born in 1820 in Extremadura. Her education was mostly focused on fashion and housework, but she was interested inliterature.

In 1839, her first poemA la palmawas published, in a newspaper calledEl Piloto. In 1843, a collection of her poetry was published with new versions re-published in 1852 and 1872. In addition to poetry, she published novels and plays.

Her work addressed diverse themes, with a strong criticism of social injustices and violence and prejudice towards women.

'En esta población tan vergonzosamente atrasada, fue un acontecimiento extraordinario el que una mujer hiciese versos, y el que los versos se pudiesen hacer sin maestro, los hombres los han graduado de copias y las mujeres, sin comprenderlos siquiera, me han consagrado por ellos todo el resentimiento de su envidia.'

'With this shamefully backward population, it was an extraordinary event that a woman wrote verses, and that the verses could be made without a teacher, the men have graded them as copies and the women, without even understanding them, have consecrated me with all their resentment and envy.'

Bulgarian Jewish author Dora Gabe published poetry, aimed at adults and children, as well as essays, short stories, translations and travel books.

She was born in 1888 in Dabovic, a village in rural north-easternBulgaria. Her father was the first Jewish person elected to the Bulgarian National Assembly. Dora attended high school in Varna, and university in Sofia. She also studied in France and Switzerland.

Пролет ('Spring'), one of her first poems, was published in 1900 when Gabe was still a teenager. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, she wrote extensively. In 1922, she founded the Bulgarian-Polish Committee and served as its president for many years, fostering relationships between the two countries through the arts.

Today, Dora Gabe is regarded as one of the most successful Bulgarian poets and is respected for her art and charity.

'Тия ниви! Ечемиците лъкатушат. Окото трепери, като ги гледа, и вятърът тича по тях. Вятърът е весел и ляга по гръб, влачи се по зелената черга. Дига се, хуква и размътя зеленият цвят на най-далечната нива, чак оттатък белите облачни кълба... Нивите пеят. Всяко стръкче си излива гласа, а вятърът грабва песента.'

'Those fields! The barley is meandering. The eye trembles looking at them, and the wind rushes over them. The wind is cheerful and lies on its back, dragging along the green brush. It rises, runs and blurs the green of the farthest fields, all the way beyond the white balls of cloud… The fields sing. Each blade pours out its voice, and the wind grabs the song.'

Writer, educator and activist Gabrielė Petkevičaitė was a pioneer of women's rights in Lithuania.

Gabrielė was an active part of the Lithuanian National Revival, a cultural and political period in the history of Lithuania that led to the formation of the modern nation. In 1920, she chaired the first session of the first parliament of the independent state ofLithuania.

She wrote regular articles forVarpas, a monthly Lithuanian language newspaper. It was published despite the Lithuanian press ban, which prohibited Lithuanian language publications in the Russian Empire from 1865 to 1904.

In all, Gabrielė wrote around 400 articles to various newspapers under her pen-name Bitė, which means bee, as she had a keen interest in beekeeping.

'Tik sąmoningumui išsiplėtojus, sakant, žmogui iš kūdikio vystyklų išaugus, patiriame visi, kokia mes, kiekvienas skyrium, dulkelė pasaulyje, tiesiog nepastebimas pasaulio didybės atomas... Todėl nesipykdinkime, pastebėję vaikų ir jaunuolių savingumą. Tai paprastas gyvenimo kelias.'

'It is only as consciousness develops, as a human being grows out of a baby's nappy, so to speak, that we all experience what a speck of dust we are in the world, just an invisible atom of the world's greatness... So let us not get angry when we notice the selfishness of children and young people. It is a simple way of life.'

Hi Maria! Tell us a bit about yourself.

When did you start working on child education?

Can you tell us about how you founded the Casa dei Bambini?

What difficulties did you encounter in your professional career?

How do you think your legacy has lived on into the present?

The woman who developed a new way of teaching children

The Montessori method was championed by Maria Montessori (1870-1952), who found new ways to educate children that were before deemed 'uneducable'.

The following is a fictional interview with Maria Montessori, in which she speaks about her life and her work helping children.

My name is Maria Montessori, I was born in Chiaravalle, Italy, in 1870. I ended up studying Medicine in Rome, graduating as the fifth woman inItalyto receive the diploma. I was 26 years old when I graduated in 1896.

The same year I participated in the International Congress on Women's Rights in Berlin, fighting for the rights of women to have equal education opportunities and salaries as men.

During my studies I worked with so-called 'phrenasthenic' children: children with some kind of cognitive delay that could lead to learning difficulties. At that time, a lot of these children were neglected and abandoned in mental institutions.

I set out to develop different study materials to help these children learn through practical play. The five senses (sight, touch, hearing, taste, smell) lay at the core of my method. All my pupils graduated from primary school with excellent results!

At the end of the 19th century, while I was carrying out my studies, Rome underwent considerable urban development which led to a wave of urban migration bringing a lot of unemployed families and 'lost people united only by poverty and malaria' to Rome.

I was called upon to solve issues with the children of these families, especially the little ones aged 3 to 6 who had never been to school. In 1907, I thus founded the firstCasa dei Bambini, or 'Children's House'. The first 50 children arrived on 6 January that year.

TheCasa Dei Bambiniis still in operation today. Everything in it is tailored to the child: all of the furniture is made of light wood and is easily movable by children. My pedagogic materials are designed to feel like games to play, but are aimed at facilitating learning from a  pre-school age onwards.

From this experience, my book (published in 1909) entitledScientific Pedagogy as Applied to Child Education in the Children's Houseswas born and then translated into many languages. The Montessori Method is largely based on the methods I employed at theCasa Dei Bambini.

It was hard for me to go and study medicine in the first place. People strongly discouraged me from starting my studies, and when I did persevere I encountered hostility and harassment by my fellow students and my professors.

In 1934, after I had been working on the Montessori method for decades and more Montessori schools had started popping up across the world, I was forced to flee Italy due to the rise of the fascist regime. In the same year, Mussolini and Hitler both ordered the closure of all Montessori schools. I returned to Italy after the war, in 1947, by invitation from the new Italian government.

I hope that my methods of education have helped children learn and thrive. Today, the Montessori method is being used by more than 60,000 schools across the world.

I died in 1952 inthe Netherlands, when I  was 81 years old. I had expressed the desire to be buried in the place where I died, so now I rest among the dunes of Noordwijk, facing the sea. On my tombstone it is written: 'I ask the dear children, who can do anything, to join me in building peace among men and in the world.'

Anna Boberg's early life and education

When did Anna Boberg paint the northern lights?

Painter who captured Arctic landscapes in Lofoten and northern Norway

Anna Boberg was a versatile self-taught artist renowned for her depictions of Arctic landscapes from Lofoten, Norway, a place she held dear and frequented throughout her life.

Anna was born in 1864 in Sweden. Her family carried a strong artistic heritage: she inherited her passion for art from her father, Fredrik Wilhelm Scholander, a prominent architect, and her mother, Carin Scholander, a theosophist and translator.

By 1887, she had dedicated herself to painting, primarily favouring watercolours. Her first exhibition was held in 1888. Her landscape paintings include studies from Jerusalem, the south ofFranceandItalyamong others.

Despite lacking formal artistic training, aside from a brief stint at the Académie Julian in Paris in the late 1880s, Anna's talent flourished.

During her time inParis, she crossed paths with her future husband, architect Ferdinand Boberg. In the photograph below, Anna is sitting among her paintings at an exhibition in 1914, chatting to Ferdinand.

Even though Anna started painting after a trip toSpain, in her autobiography, it seems like her artistic life only really began in 1901.

This was when she went to the north ofNorwayfor the first time, accompanying her husband. The landscape of Lofoten bewitched Anna so much that she refused to return home with Ferdinand, who had had to travel back without her. He sent Anna painting materials so she could capture her new obsession.

Anna's paintings of the Northern Lights and the midnight sun are especially captivating, depicting the aurora borealis in all its mystique and vivid colour.

In winter 1901, Anna returned to Norway, writing in her memoir:

…when the full moon, like a sun made of ice, disperses the night of noon, when the aurora borealis flares among the stars and storm clouds and waves chase each other, when the Lofoten Wall forms a wondrous stronghold with bastions and towers of alabaster… and the sea becomes dotted with armadas of Viking ships. Return then, stranger, to behold the apotheosis of Arctic beauty and wilderness!

Ferdinand quickly realised that, as a good husband and architect, he would have to design and build a house for them in Norway.

Over the following 33 years, Boberg returned to her beloved Lofoten more than three dozen times, capturing its ethereal beauty in her paintings. The cabin in Svolvaer that Ferdinand had created for them was her pied-à-terre in the icy north.

Although the Swedes were slow to warm to Anna's Norwegian scenic paintings, her work gained a lot of attention in Paris and the United States. The American press even went as far as calling her 'Sweden’s greatest artist'.

Anna's last exhibition took place in 1927. In 1929, Ferdinand and Anna went back to live in Stockholm,Sweden, where she died after surgery complications in 1935.

Anna has only recently been reconsidered by the Swedish art world as one of the great Scandinavian landscape painters. Since 2018, her art has been on permanent display at Nationalmuseum, Sweden's museum of art and design.

The self-portrait

Women’s metamorphosis

Cindy Sherman – transforming into the stereotype of myself

Libera Mazzoleni – the witch

Carolee Schneemann – turning myself into a sofa

Tomaso Binga – an alphabet made of me

A look at women transforming themselves to fight for gender rights during the ‘70s and the ‘80s

The ancient Roman poet Ovid's 'Metamorphoses', depicted women turning into elements of the natural world: plants, rocks, animals. A shift from the male gaze happens in the renaissance period when women start to represent themselves through self-portraits. By the 70’s and 80’s self-portraits become tools that allow women to redefine themselves through transformation.

To make a self-portrait is a schizoid act.

Susan Butler, 'So How Do I Look? Women Before and Behind the Camera'

American journalist and biographer Susan Butler claims that there is a significant difference the photographer has to face between self-perception and the way people perceive their appearance. When looking at a photograph, one is essentially observing a part of the world through the eyes of the photographer at the precise moment when the photo was taken. When a woman takes a self-portrait, she compels the world to see her as she desires.

Self-portraits are, in the modern era, a way for women to exert control over the perception others have of them, especially in a society where the representation of women is often mediated by the male gaze in art, cinema, and media.

During the '70s and '80s, the voices of women spread across Europe and America, advocating for a more equal society. The intentions and ideas behind the movements were diverse. Some groups advocated for changes in individual laws, while others believed that rebellion had to target the structure of society. This phenomenon witnessed women breaking free from family isolation and coming together.

From the need to be individually seen as they desired, some female photographers leaped into the power of depicting categories of women (from different socioeconomic classes and ethnicities to different eras), or all women, as they wished, to make the world see all women as they intended.
But they also altered their appearance through art to convey a message.

Ovid's ‘Metamorphoses’ is one of the few examples of ancient Latin narrative texts that consists of tales explaining ancient myths, where individuals were transformed into something different –Echointo a stone,Daphneinto a tree – by gods. With a modern sensibility, Ovid also put himself in women’s shoes and represented in ‘Metamorphoses’  women's inner struggles.

Photography in the ‘70s and 80’s showed women transforming themselves. They changed their appearance through self-representation as a reflection of a significant societal change. They played with the metamorphosis that society had historically imposed on them: turning women into objects of male desire and stereotypes.

Cindy Sherman is a renowned American artist, photographer, and filmmaker. She has always been passionate about costumes and transformation. Her 'Untitled Film Stills' series (1977-1980) consists of over 70 pictures. She portrays herself dressed as iconic Hollywood stars, shedding light on the voyeuristic gaze of cinema, representing women’s body and identity as a simulacrum of male desire.

Recently, she was featured in a Marc Jacobs campaign for its upcoming 2024 spring/summer collection. At 70 years old, Sherman was selected because of her role in transforming the perception of beauty and identity. In the advertisement, Sherman once again undergoes a transformation, turning herself into a rebel punk rocker and into a businesswoman in sky-high heels.

During the 1970s, feminist movements turned their attention towards the history of witches. Feminism reexamined the witches' story and the historic oppression of these women that took rise from the 1400s and saw from 40,000 to 60,000 trials ending with capital punishment in Europe. Rediscovering it and aligning with the role of witches, women in the '70s felt they were consistently transformed into a demonised version of themselves when they gained power.

The Italian artist Libera Mazzoleni worked on 'Le Streghe' (the Witches) from 1975 to 1976. 
It is a series of 12 pictures in which she used the technique of photographic collage to juxtapose her self-portraits inside portraits of witches from lithographs dating back to the 1500s.

I am part of the history of the demonisation of women, like every woman who has been destroyed by the violence of a history that erased non-absorbable existences.

Carolee Schneemann was an American artist and painter who scandalised modern society with her works and performances due to their explicit content.
Her first work,Eye Body: 36 Transformative Actions(1963), is a captivating exploration of the objectification of women.

Through 36 pictures, she depicts herself gradually transforming into an object among the other items in her loft, surrounded by feathers, heels, and broken mirrors, as shown in the picture above.

Bianca Pucciarelli Menna, known as Tomaso Binga, is an Italian poet and conceptual artist. Particularly interested in blending art and language, in 1976 she brought to life her most famous work 'Alfabetiere murale' (Alphabet mural) , in which she recreates the alphabet using her body – a concept now referred to as ‘scrittura vivente’ (asemic writing).

Her work stemmed from the need to change the way society talked and thought about women and the female body – a real body and not an idea of the male mind – and to remember that change is also in the words we use.

In Ovid’s 'Metamorphoses', women transform into flowers because they become the victim of a god who doesn’t know what “no” means.
With the rising of feminist tides, women are reclaiming control over how the world perceives them: no more like flowers, rocks and robins due to men’s behaviour.

Hildegard von Bingen

Anna Botsford Comstock

Octavia Hill

Rachel Carson

A Look at today’s women environmentalists

A look at women from the past and present who continue to inspire climate action

The direct link between humankind’s impact on the environment and our chances of survival within it is not a recent discovery. Environmental concerns have been around for a very long time and women have used different ways to share this knowledge and work towards bringing positive changes. Let’s meet some of them.

Hildegard von Bingen, who lived in present day Germany from 1098 to 1179, can be considered one of the early environmentalists. Her understanding of the importance of respecting the environment and all creation came through a religious lens.

In each creature that comes from God, even the one that seems most useless, there is some usefulness, even if humans do not know it.

Her view of the word  ‘creatures’ meant flora, fauna, elements, metals and all existing natural things.

Hildegard maintained that the body, the spirit, the soul and the environment are the four pillars of health and are closely connected. She understood that humans are made of the same material as other beings and that destroying nature was the same as destroying humanity. She asserted that nature takes care of us and we must take care of it in return.

Ann Bostford Comstock shared the importance of understanding our wild and natural landscape through her educational text for children. Through her books, she fostered love and appreciation of nature and wanted people to understand that they play a crucial role in it.

She worked with other nature educators at Cornell University and compiled her collective work and publications into ‘*The Handbook of Nature Study (1911)*’. The book is still in print and is still used throughout the world. In this handbook, she wrote about diverse topics from ‘Stone and Minerals’ to the seasons, weather and astronomy.

The book includes lessons on mammals, fish, birds and their habitats. Her lessons transcend time and are still relevant and inspiring to people today.

nature-study gives the child a sense of companionship with life out-of-doors and an abiding love of nature

Anna Bostford Comstock was one of the first educators to take students and teachers outdoors to study nature. She was an advocate for conservationism by imprinting a love and respect for our environment through her educational tools.

English social reformer Octavia Hill had a strong commitment to alleviating poverty and improving the welfare of inhabitants of cities. She felt that natural spaces needed to be accessible and were essential for the wellbeing of everyone and especially those who didn’t have money to travel far to reach nature. She campaigned against developments on suburban woodlands and helped save London’s Hampstead Heath and Parliament Hill Fields from being built on.

Octavia supported the Common Preservation Society’s efforts to safeguard open spaces around London in the face of unchecked expansion. She spoke of the dangers of reproducing inner London’s problems in the outer suburbs.  In a paper of 1888, she marked the imbalance between open space to the west and that to the east of London, and used her evidence to argue for rapid adjustment.

She was one of the three founders of the Natural Trust, set up to preserve places of natural beauty and historic interest for the public, which still plays an important role in the maintenance of parks, landscapes and stately homes in the UK.

The right of access to beauty and nature is an essential element towards the wellbeing of every man, woman and child.

American marine biologist and author Rachel Carson challenged the belief that humans could dominate nature through the use of chemicals, for example in farming and agriculture. She questioned the scope and direction of modern science and initiated the contemporary environmental movement.

Her bookSilent Spring, which highlighted problems caused by synthetic pesticides, was met with fierce opposition by chemical companies but gradually led to a ban on the insecticide DDT and other pesticides.

But man is a part of nature, and his war against nature is inevitably a war against himself.

There are prominent women working towards supporting climate actions such as Brazil’s Minister of the Environment and Climate Change, Marina Silva, Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg and more.

But there are some voices in the environmental cause that rarely reach the spotlight - those of people with disabilities. Climate change affects everyone but those affected first are marginalised groups, with the disability community affected the most.

Climate activist Pauline Castres has spent decades working on global health and disability rights policies. She also writes for The British Medical Journal and The Lancet on the effects of air pollution on public health.

success is when a policy delivers concrete and sustainable changes to help those who are most left behind. There are huge inequalities even within activism spaces, and we can only call ourselves successful when the poorest and most marginalised experience a real difference in their lives

Disability policy researcher Valerie Novack works on issues that affect multiply marginalised people with disabilities. She focuses on climate action and the effects of  urban planning on housing and transportation. She realised that few states in the US had plans for protecting and evacuating disabled citizens in the event of a disaster.

If a global pandemic or an unlivable increase in rent costs don’t push our government to make changes, what can I accomplish?

She focuses now on her community, providing food locally and researching programmes run by people with disabilities.

Within discussions and actions around creating better environments for our future, no one should be left behind. Marginalised people's needs need to be at the forefront.

SustainedAbilitya disability led network working on environmental justice and disability is a space were the disability community and allies can co-create empowering changes.

How did Jenny Nyström create the Christmas tomte?

What inspired Jenny Nyström?

Why did Jenny Nyström paint portraits?

Jenny Nyström was the first person in Sweden to make a profession from illustrating children’s books and became Sweden’s most productive painter and illustrator.

Jenny Nyström was the first person in Sweden to make a profession from illustrating children’s books and became Sweden’s most productive painter and illustrator. She is also thought of as the mother of the Swedish Christmas tomte (a gnome-like figure from folklore).

Jenny was born in 1854 in Kalmar Sweden and moved to Gotherburg when she was eight years old. There, she started art school, and went on to the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in Stockholm, then to further study in Paris.

Jenny tried to convince a Swedish publisher to start producing postcards - she had seen these gain popularity during her stay in Paris - but was unsuccessful at the time. Instead, she produced some drawings for a children’s story called Lille Viggs äventyr på julafton (‘Little Vigg's Adventures on Christmas Eve’).

The author, Viktor Rydberg, saw these drawings and in 1871, his book was published with Jenny’s illustrations and has since become a much beloved Christmas story in Sweden. It was for this project that Jenny researched the folk figure of the tomte.

The Swedish tomte looks like a gnome, with a long robe, a woolly hat and a long beard. The word ‘tomte’ comes from ‘tomt’ meaning a plot of land, or literally ‘homestead man’. The tomte works hard to care for animals, children and the home. All he asks for in return is a bowl of porridge. But he is mischievous and has a bad temper, so if he spots any bad behaviour he will not hesitate to throw the household into chaos!

Featuring in Rydberg’s Christmas story, Jenny’s depictions of the tomte - which bear more than a passing resemblance to Santa’s elves - linked the Swedish version of Santa to these gnomes of Scandinavian folklore. Subsequently, her depictions of tomte were used on many Christmas cards - and continue to be used in creative designs, memes and animations today.

via GIPHY, by Aleksandra Strzelichowska, 2022.Based on' 'Julkort, brevkort'by Nyström, Jenny (1854-1946) - 1970 - Malmö Museum, Sweden - CC BY

In 1911, Jenny won a contract to illustrate greetings cards for a publishing house. She was required to produce many illustrations each month to fulfil her contract. These drawings provided a great deal of exposure for her.

Jenny’s career as an illustrator was, if not prompted, then sustained and motivated, by a need to support her family. Her husband Daniel became ill with tuberculosis and was unable to finish his studies to become a doctor. So to support him and their son Curt, Jenny became both artist and entrepreneur.

Lots of her illustrations are of children living idyllic lives that recall her own childhood, they are full of joy and whimsy.

Jennyexplained her inspirationas follows: ‘The reason I mainly illustrate children’s books is probably because I have always loved children and have always wanted to show children something of the fair sunny land east of the sun and west of the moon, beauty which has remained in my memory from my childhood in Kalmar.’

Jenny’s work wasn’t all about Christmas or idyllic childhoods. She had a fine arts education and also produced artworks in a much more classicist, traditional style.

She painted portraits, including those of convalescents. This was a popular theme in visual art at the turn of the 20th century and would also have found resonance in Jenny’s own life with her husband’s illness. Daniel died in 1927.

At the time, there was a rise of - and a backlash against - what had become known as the ‘New Woman’ - emancipated, rule-breaking, decadent women. The proliferation of convalescent pictures is thought to be an attempt to return feisty professional women to their rightful place in the home, either as sickly yet idealised subjects or as doting nursemaids.

Jenny’s convalescent painting follows a classicist academic style, full of overt symbols of death, religion and stereotyped female ideals. Did this represent her own perspective, or was it a (successful) attempt to tap into the fashion of the day with the Salon-going public interested in ‘tear-jerking subjectsand dazzling technical bravura’? It is interesting to note that herStudy for the convalescentis more spontaneous, less idealised and more realistic.

Jenny Nyström is an example of a woman who was talented artistically and also showed great business acumen, turning her prolific hand to the types of works that could sell and support her family.

Who proposed the first International Women's Day?

When was the first International Women's Day celebrated?

What were the origins of Women's History Day?

How did International Women's Day expand?

From Women’s Day to a women’s month recognition

Women’s History Month is an annual celebration every March of the achievement of women throughout history and around the world. It’s a moment to showcase women’s often under-recognised, silenced and important achievements from history.

Let's take a look at how Women's History Month developed.

Before Women’s History Month, there was International Women’s Day. According to Britannica and CNRS News, International Women’s Day was first formed at a women’s conference in 1910.

At the second International Socialist Women’s Conference in Copenhagen, German activist Clara Zetkin proposed that International Women’s Day be recognised as an official holiday.

Early feminists of the time were already fighting for equal rights. Clara Zetkin believed that the feminist movement consisted of upper and middle class women who had their own agenda at heart. She did not believe they were working towards the interests of working class women.

In her view, ‘bourgeois feminism’ aimed to minimise sexism but preserved class divisions. She felt that the socialist movement was the only way to end oppression of women and so set out to create a space outside of mainstream feminism for working women.

On 19 March 1911, several European countries officially celebrated International Women’s Day.

Over 1 million activists from Austria, Poland, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Denmark took part in demonstrations. In Austria-Hungary alone, there were 300 demonstrations. Across Europe, women demanded the right to vote, hold public office and protested against employment discrimination.

International Women’s Day began to be celebrated in late February or early March in different countries, with no set date for almost a decade.

In 1921, Zetkin proposed that 8 March be International Women’s Day. This was in honour of the 1917 worker’s strike in Petrograd on that day which had marked the beginning of the Russian revolution. As a result, a new tradition was created which brought on an opportunity for communist parties to mobilise women.

The idea of having a day to celebrate women workers spread in Europe.

However, the most popular story behind the origins of Women’s History Day tells a different story.

One version says that the day started on 8 March 1857 or 1908 (depending on the story), as women from multiple factories in New York City organised strikes to protest working conditions and child labour.

French historian Françoise Picq argues that this strike is a myth.

It was fabricated and mentioned for the first time in 1955 in the French daily newspaperL’Humanité. There was no mention of a strike in the US newspapers in 1857, nor was it brought up by the leaders of the International Socialist Women’s Movement who founded International Women’s Day.

Picq believes that the then-leader of the largest French trade-union Madeleine Colin brought the story to the attention ofL’Humanité, as she might have wanted to separate International Women’s Day celebrations from its communist origins.

Believing that the celebration had become too traditional and conservative, Colin wanted the celebration in France to be independent of the dominant French Union of French Women and the Communist Party. The story about the US workers would shed a different light on the struggle of women workers and also make it more accepted by U.S feminists who would have had concerns over the holiday’s communist origins.

With increased popularity in America, in 1970, US feminists turned International Women’s Day into Women’s History Week in order to increase women’s history education in schools.

By 1975, the United Nations formally sponsored the annual celebration of International Women’s Day. More groups around the world began to mark the full Women's History Week. In 1980, the US president Jimmy Carter nominated the first National Women’s History Week, which included 8 March.

Women’s history observations grew from there. By 1986, fourteen states in the US recognised March as Women’s History Month.

The following year, the U.S. Congress established Women’s History Month as an annual federally-recognised observance. This was an effort that was led by theNational Women’s History Alliancewith thousands of individuals and women’s organisations.

National Women’s History Month is now recognised throughout the world. Women’s History Month is now celebrated in March in the US, UK and Australia, in August in South Africa and in October in Canada.

Every year at Europeana, we celebrate Women’s History Month with cultural heritage institutions and women’s organisations across Europe and beyond by sharing stories and movements honouring women from the past and present.

Who was Fern Andra?

What work did Fern Andra do in Europe?

What were Fern Andra's films?

Fern Andra's later life

Since the earliest days of film, women have been writing, producing, and directing films. Exceptional talents such asAlice Guy-Blachéand Germaine Dulac in France, Elvira Notari in Italy, Lois Weber in the US and Esfir Shub in the USSR were pioneers in film-making.

Despite their significance during the era of silent films, their names have been inexplicably omitted from film history for decades. Thanks to the efforts of feminist film scholars and curators, these remarkable filmmakers and their works have been rediscovered.

Fern Andra was one of thesefilmpioneers.

Born Fern Edna Andrews or Vernal Andrews in Illinois in 1893, her career was as spectacular as her life.

At just four years old, Fern performed in a tightrope act in a vaudeville show. In 1899, she made her film debut inUncle Tom's Cabin. She played the role of Little Eva, making her one of the first child actors in cinema.

Later, she joined the Millman sisters, a well-known group of acrobats, as a tightrope walker, and toured the US, Canada, and Europe. Bird Millman, the troupe's head, was one of the most celebrated female high-wire performers and a star of the Ziegfeld Follies at that time.

After her time with the Millmans, Fern Andra continued her career in Europe.

She produced and starred inRagtime Revuein London before settling in Vienna. In 1913, she joined forces with Leo Gaumont, a French pioneer of the motion picture industry. She became part of the German branch of his film production company in Berlin. During this period, she also attended acting lessons at Max Reinhardt's drama school.

The beginning ofWorld War Iled to the closure of Gaumont's German branch, prompting Fern Andra to establish her own production company.

In 1915, she was credited as producer and writer for the first time for her film,Geheimnisvolle Gewalten. The same year, she directed her debut film,Eine Motte flog zum Licht.

The film was the first to be set in the circus milieu, a setting also favoured by Andra's later works. In 1916, she opened the Fern-Andra-Filmatelier (Fern Andra Film Studio) in Berlin and also owned movie theatres in Munich and Düsseldorf. Georg Bluen, a former colleague from Gaumont, became her business partner and directed some of her films.

As a producer, director, screenwriter and actress, Fern Andra made more than 40 films inGermanyalone.

Her roles varied widely, portraying characters such as a millionaire's daughter, a burgher's wife, a circus performer, a ballet dancer, a florist, a snake dancer, a queen, and an enslaved person. Many of her films were set in the circus, allowing her to showcase her artistic talent in roles like trapeze artists, tightrope performers, or animal tamers.

While some critics debate the quality of her melodramatic films, Fern Andra, like Asta Nielsen and Henny Porten, was a massive star and audience favourite in Germany during the 1910s and early 1920s.

She was a 'self-made woman' with a lifelong background in show business. Her two autobiographies recounted sensational adventures, attracting ironic comments from the contemporary press.

Fern Andra's private life was equally spectacular. As an American, she faced suspicion of espionage during World War I and was considered an 'enemy foreigner'. Her marriage to a German baron allegedly saved her from death.

In 1919, Fern Andra left her production company and began working with Robert Wiene, the director of the Weimar silent film classicDas Cabinet des Dr. Caligari(The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari). In Wiene'sGenuine(1920), a expressionist horror film sequel to Caligari, Andra received wide recognition in the title role, with some critics hailing the collaboration as ideal.

In 1922, the American magazine Variety declared that Fern Andra had died after a plane crash. She had, in fact, survived. However, during the early 1920s, her fame began to decline in Germany, as her movie subjects and acting style did not align with the changing landscape of modern film performance.

In 1928, she left Germany for the UK and then returned to the USA two years later, unable to recapture her earlier success.

In 1943, she played her final role in the American dramaLotus Lady. Afterwards, she pursued a career directing plays, working in radio, and serving as a manager and costume consultant in Hollywood.

Married to a US military officer, she returned to Germany in the early 1950s and appeared in the stage playTragödie einer Diva(Tragedy of a Diva) in 1966. She lived in Wiesbaden, Germany until 1973, dedicating much of her time to tracking down her films, many of which are now considered lost. A copy of her filmUm Krone und Peitschehas survived at theNetherlands EYE Film Institute, though it is no longer available due to copyright reasons.

Fern Andra passed away in 1974 in Aiken, South Carolina, leaving behind a legacy of pioneering contributions to the early film industry.

Ingenious recipes

Incredible inventions

The first recorded recipe for an ice cream cone

Who was Agnes Marshall?

Inventor and entrepreneur Agnes Marshall was a Victorian celebrity chef. She founded a cookery school, wrote cookbooks, and published a magazine,'The Table'. Nicknamed ‘Queen of ices’, she is credited as having invented the ice cream cone.

Behind its inconspicuous cover, a cookery book namedThe Book of Icesfrom 1885 guards many delicious, tongue-tingling treats. See if you can read the subtitle without your mouth watering: The Book of Ices including cream and water ices, sorbets, mousses, iced souffles, and various iced dishes, with names in French and English, and various coloured designs for ices.

Self-published by her own School of Cookery and priced at half a crown in 1885 (about €0.13 in today’s money), the book shows how to make, mould and freeze ices, as well as how to make custards for cream ices. Would you like yours ‘Very rich’, ‘Ordinary’, ‘Common’ or ‘Cheap’? Agnes offers recipes for all these variations!

The book boasts ice recipes for the kinds of flavours you might expect, like banana, vanilla and strawberry, as well as more unusual ones like brown bread, rice, tea, white wine, and ‘spinach à la crème’.

As you can see, not all of her recipes were sweet. Take ‘Souffles of Curry à la Ripon’ as an example, which includes fish fried with butter, onions, herbs, sour apples, coconut and almonds, which is then boiled with milk, lemon, curry powder, curry paste, saffron and tamarind, before being pureed and mixed with whipped aspic and cream to thicken, put into paper souffle cases and frozen, then served garnished with prawns.

The Book of Icesis only part recipe book - its other purpose was to promote and sell Marshall’s inventions.

The Marshall’s Patent Freezer, designed by Agnes and patented by Agnes’ husband, Alfred Marshall, could freeze a pint of ice cream in less than five minutes.

The Marshall Ice Cave was an insulated box for storing ice cream - a little like the cool box you might take camping.

As well as these inventions, Marshall’s book advertises three variations of an ‘Improved ice breaker’, as well as moulds of various designs. Agnes designed over 1,000 different moulds in total. Would you like your ice or mousse shaped like a hen on her nest of eggs, or as a cauliflower? No problem! ‘Moulds for these designs can be had of A.B. Marshall.’

In another of her cookbooks,Mrs A. B. Marshall's Cookery Book, published 12 May 1888, we find what might be her most influential recipe of all - ‘Cornet with Cream’.

Wafers date back to ancient times, but it is hard to pinpoint exactly when they started being used for ice cream. There are some earlier hints of ice cream cone-like creations - see the following painting by Debucourt from 1807, in which at the bottom right you can see a lady eating something that looks a lot like an ice cream - but the first hard evidence comes from Agnes Marshall’s book, which is why she is often credited as being the inventor of the modern ice cream cone.

Marshall’s cornet recipe uses finely chopped almonds, fine flour, caster sugar, one egg, a pinch of salt and a tablespoon of orange flower water, mixed to a paste. The paste is spread over greased baking tins, then briefly baked. Once baked, the cornets are quickly cut out of the paste and wrapped around a cornet tin to make the shape we know and love. Then baked again ‘till quite crisp and dry’.

To make them extra fancy, Marshall suggests to ‘Ornament the edges with a little Royal icing by means of a bag and pipe, and then dip the icing into different coloured sugars’.

Unfortunately, there is no picture in this book of the cornets. Involume 2ofMrs. A.B. Marshall's larger cookery book of extra recipes, Marshall uses a number of cornets (coloured red with liquid carmine) inside a square mould to make what she calls ‘Fleur a la Florence’ which can be served ‘for a dinner sweet or for ball supper’.

And in her final bookFancy Ices, this recipe appears as ‘Margaret Cornets’, which are then used as the basis for both ‘Christina Cornets’ (filled with a vanilla ice cream mixed with ‘any nice dried fruits’ and ‘as much ground cinnamon as will cover a threepenny piece’) and ‘Dorothy Cornets’ (filled with champagne ice).

Agnes Beere Smith was born in 1852, an illegitimate child, raised in a poor part of the east end of London. She was brought up by her grandmother in Walthamstow and had three half-siblings.

When her own daughter Ethel was born in 1878, Agnes was working as a domestic servant. A few months later, Agnes married Alfred William Marshall (who was not Ethel’s father), with whom she had three more children.

In 1882, the ‘Married Women’s Property Act’ came into English law, allowing married women to purchase property. In 1883, Agnes and Alfred jointly purchased their cookery school, which quickly became a success. Shortly after opening her cookery school, she was teaching high-end English and French cuisine to 40 students, five or six times a week.

It isn’t quite clear how Agnes learnt to cook. In the preface toMrs A.B. Marshall’s Cookery Book, she writes that her recipes are ‘the result of practical training and lessons, through several years, from leading English and Continental authorities, as well as a home experience earlier than I can well recall.’ Perhaps, as a domestic servant and kitchen maid, Agnes paid close attention and learnt on the job?

Agnes was adept at self-promotion as the advertisements in herBook of Icesshow. In the preface toMrs A.B. Marshall’s Cookery Book, she states that the book is ‘published at the repeated solicitations of some thousands of my old pupils’ and directs particularly interested readers to ‘Volumes V., VI., and VII. of the ‘TABLE’’ which ‘contain very many recipes of new dishes of my inventions’ but urges readers to hurry because ‘they will doubtless be shortly out of print.’

Her touring showA Pretty Luncheonin 1888 made her a household name across England. In it, Agnes cooked meals in front of large audiences (up to 600 people) to promoteMrs A. B. Marshall's Cookery Book. After an initial run of shows in Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, Glasgow and London, Marshall went on tour again with shows in another 12 towns and cities. She also toured the United States but didn’t see the same kind of success there as she did in England.

Agnes died of cancer in July 1905. Her legacy of popularising ice cream in England, and the ice cream cone worldwide, lives on. And if you see chefs today freezing food quickly using liquid nitrogen - as in the clip below showing UK-based chef Heston Blumenthal's eggs and bacon ice cream - you can thank Agnes for that too - as she was the first person to suggest the idea!

How was the Hill House built?

What architectural styles are in the Hill House?

How was the interior of the Hill House designed?

The Hill House as a home

Further reading

How Charles Rennie Mackintosh and Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh created a domestic masterpiece in western Scotland

In 1902, at the height of his powers, the famous Scottish architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh (1868-1928) was commissioned to design a family home for book publisher Walter Blackie (1860-1953) in Helensburgh, a town situated about 50km northwest of Glasgow.

The project also involved Mackintosh’s wife Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh (1864-1933) - a well-established artist and interior designer, talented and with useful experience in many different mediums and crafts.

Walter Blackie had admired Charles' work at the Glasgow School of Art – maybe the public building he is most well known for. He designed a new building to house the school, on two occasions - between 1897-1899 and 1907-1909.

Today, Glasgow School of Art is recognised as one of Europe's top universities in the visual creative disciplines. Unfortunately it has twice been severely damaged by a fire, in 2014 and in 2018.

Both Charles and Margaret were working in the Scottish Art Nouveau movement called Glasgow Style. They were most probably a perfect team to take on this 'total art project', which included both exterior and interior design.

So let’s take a closer look at the house, considered as Mackintosh’s masterpiece of domestic homes: The Hill House.

Walter Blackie seems to have had a clear vision about the exterior of the house when he told Charles: '...grey roughcast for the walls, and slate for the roof; and that any architectural effect sought should be secured by the massing of the parts rather than by adventitious ornamentation'.

Since the house was going to be designed inside out, Charles wanted to learn the Blackie family's needs for their new home. In order to do so, Charles actually lived with the family for a few days.

The Hill House is built in local sandstone and is rough-cast rendered, giving it the look of austere simplicity.

With its massive walls and the overall design, the house seems to bear a tradition of Scottish baronial buildings. For example, it is said that there are details of the Hill House that are similar to parts of the 16th century Scottish Crathes Castle.

Mackintosh embraced vernacular architecture too. At the beginning of the 1890s, he spent several summer holidays in the Cotswolds in England, where he sketched vernacular buildings. He liked their unaffected simplicity and the emphasis on function and domestic connection.

Mackintosh continued the work on the Hill House by adding various forms, making it asymmetrical with different roof levels and shapes. In previous designs by Mackintosh, organic forms like circles and curves were prominent features. Now in the Hill House, squares and rectangles are his top priority.

Take the windows for instance: The Hill House has 58 asymmetrical windows in about 40 different designs! They vary in many ways, but they are all geometric in shape.

Mackintosh’s fascination for squares and rectangles is followed inside the house, like the square carpets showing the way through the house. This indicates that Mackintoshes did not rule out one over the other when designing. They did not only design geometrically for decorative purposes, but also to be used in a functional way.

Evidence of Charles’ and Margaret’s avant-garde style is constantly present in the building's interiors. Female and male forms and schemes of colour vary in each room with the room's intended use.

The walls in the house are mostly white, some delicately decorated with stencilled patterns in pink, green, grey and silver. A geometric rose is a common motif.

The hall appears sober, framed in rectilinear dark wood. It leads to a lighter, brighter drawing room.

Here the Mackintoshes chose to create three different zones for different activities. This is similar to something we often want for ourselves nowadays, like an open plan kitchen, which also serves as a dining room as well as a comfortable sitting room.

In the drawing room of the Hill House, there are places for music, for sitting in the sun and a snug to keep warm and cosy during the winter. In the middle of the room, they placed a large carpet with squares, maybe to encourage other ways of furnishing and using the room.

There is also a fireplace. Above the mantel shelf is a gesso panel by Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh. This was an artwork made on site:The Sleeping Princess. Gesso is a technique with a special kind of plaster mixture which is used to prepare a surface for painting. Margaret often used it when creating art.

When entering the principal bedroom there are two mirrored linen and silk embroidery panels on both sides of the bed. Both were designed by Margaret, as well as the bedspreads. Charles’ iconic black ladder-back chair is also to be found there. It’s more an object d’art than a chair to sit on, and also a perfect place to drape clothes before going to bed.

Charles and Margaret designed nearly all pieces of furniture, light fittings, textiles and decorative items custom–made for the Hill House. The lamps, especially those hanging from the ceilings, are aesthetically unique. The design combines the Glasgow Style with Japanese influences.

The Blackie family moved into the Hill House in 1904.

The Mackintoshes handed over their new home, with Charles saying: 'Here is the house. It’s not an Italian Villa, an English Mansion House, a Swiss Chalet, or a Scotch Castle. It is a Dwelling House.' Walter Blackie and his family lived nearly 50 years in their home on the hill.

Over the years, the Hill House has suffered severely from water damage. Its location on a very exposed site in the west ofScotlandhas made it vulnerable for rain and wind.

Since 1982, theNational Trust for Scotland (NTS)has been responsible for the Hill House, and are working intensely to save it for the future. During this important work, the Hill House is still open for visitors.

Hi Jānis, Tell us a bit about yourself.

How did you find out about Europeana.eu and what do you use it for?

What are you feeling inspired by currently?

Jānis Jankevics uses the annual creative competition as a way for his students to hone their digital skills, and discover ready-to-use cultural materials from Europeana.eu

Teacher Jānis Jankevics tells us how introducing Europeana’s collections to his students hones their technical skills and activates their artistic flair too.

I’m head of audiovisual communication design at Liepaja Music, Art and Design Secondary School for 16-20 year olds. I also teach new media art to students at Liepaja University in Latvia. In both places, I teach video technologies and animation.

I have a Master's degree in Art and a Master's degree in Philosophy. Last year, I began writing a PhD at the Art Academy of Latvia in Riga.

In my free time I do parkour and free running, and make videos to prove it! Here’s one from 2020.

I discovered Europeana through the GIF IT UP contest. When a colleague sent me a link about it, I thought ‘Yes! I can integrate this into my classes!’ So we started to take part, and have joined in for the last five or six years. Five of my students got prizes in the competition this year.

Having participated in the GIF IT UP contest for two years and receiving awards for both years, I can say that this event is really cool. In my opinion, creating a small story in GIF format is both creatively challenging and technical, but each year it is like a small challenge for our course. The fact that this is a competition, in my view, also inspires us to try harder, because everyone wants to represent the school's name. I would gladly participate in contests in several other subjects because then it's not just a learning process but an artistic challenge.

Leons Skudrītis, student

Before we joined GIF IT UP, I ran a similar task with students, asking them to animate a still image - to cut it into layers and animate it. With GIF IT UP, they could do that task and participate in a competition.

The students enjoy it - taking part in GIF IT UP has become a tradition. There is some competition between themselves - every year, I show the previous year’s works and the new students try to make something better. I really like that there are a lot of prize categories, not just one grand prize, and that makes it more attractive for the students too.

Kill Me Now Language Learning GIF, by Nikola Tērauda (Riga, Latvia), 2023.Based on' English 3 third step, children’s book with illustrations from Mauritius'published by Museon, the Netherlands, CC BY.

As a teacher, it’s a nice exercise to do with students. All I do is show them how to search Europeana.eu for material with the right licences. Often, students use materials that they shouldn’t and then they get into trouble because they can’t publish them. So GIF IT UP is a good opportunity for them to learn about resources they can use safely, without infringing copyright.

Everything else is up to them. I don’t intervene. They do the work. It’s quite easy for them. It’s not a complicated website.

Dance like nobody is watching GIFby Rainers Dāboliņš (Liepaja, Latvia), 2023.Based on'God Krishna Dancing on the Head of the Snake Demon Kaliya (Kaliyadamana)'published by Art Institute Chicago, USA. CC0.

Joining GIF IT UP consolidates students’ skills. Before the contest, I show them all the tools and then they get on with it. They already have the technical skills, it’s the artistic part that they get the most out of. I always say they should make it clever in the sense that it’s not just a showcase of their technical skill, I want them to make something that’s funny and clever. That’s what they can express with their GIFs.

In my opinion, it is cool that our teacher offers us to participate in GIF IT UP. It is a good way to showcase our skills to a wider audience. Those works are seen and evaluated by creative professionals. And when I found out that I had won, I felt especially pleased. From GIF IT UP I learned to make my works more personal, based on my feelings.

I haven’t made my own artwork for about two years, but when I do, I always work with other people. For me, as a teacher, it’s very good because I have artists all around me all the time. If I need something specific, I can always find someone who can help.

I don’t follow artists a lot on social media. I mostly follow freerunning and parkour athletes and some local artists. I am more inspired by reading philosophy books. I’d recommend Camera Lucida by Roland Barthes.

In my PhD I’m focussing on virtual reality as a medium. It’s a bit different to what I teach - I teach classical flat animation. My PhD is on virtual reality and more especially VR in documentary contexts - VR experiences that are reconstructions of real events.

I have an ambition about a virtual reality experience that I want to make. My masters degree in philosophy looked at technological metaphors applied to people in various times. For example, Plato compared the human soul to a chariot with two horses. Freud used a metaphor of a hydraulic system when he was talking about human emotions. Today, we tend to use a metaphor of computers - mind as an information processor. Sometimes we use them unreflectively and start to believe it’s real and not a metaphor. I want to make a VR documentary experience that goes through these metaphors chronologically. I think it’d work well through the VR medium. I think Europeana could be useful for some references here, like old drawings for mechanisms like the chariot.

Serving behind the lines

African American soldiers in the Netherlands

Who is the enemy?

‘Faites comme home’

The hidden story of African American soldiers in the Netherlands

More than 15,000 African American soldiers were stationed in the Netherlands during World War II, but their stories have not been represented in the overall narrative about the war. In this blog, historian Sebastiaan Vonk introduces the stories of the Black Liberators.

'We fought gallantly. When I say we, I mean people who looked like me.' Matthew S. Brown would repeat these words numerous times when he returned to Europe for the first time in 2019.

Brown was one of the 1.2 million African American soldiers who served during World War II.

War was not their only battle. They faced racism at home, and abroad. Late historian Stephen Ambrose once captured the absurdity of it all when he wrote that 'the world’s greatest democracy fought the world’s greatest racist with a segregated army.'

In the segregated U.S. armed forces, African American soldiers were largely assigned to supporting units, partly as a result of racist notions that African Americans were incapable of being good combat soldiers. (There were some notable exceptions, such as the Tuskegee Airmen.)

In the Netherlands, the 784th Tank Battalion helped to liberate the city of Venlo alongside the 35th Infantry Division in March 1945. The battalion, like pretty much every unit African American soldiers were assigned to, was made up of African American soldiers, with the exception of the officers. There were only three Black tank battalions in the U.S. army duringWorld War II.

In theNetherlands, over 15,000 African American soldiers were stationed during the war.

The majority were in the south of the province of Limburg, which served as the logistical hub for the 9th U.S. Army from October 1944 until March 1945.

African American soldiers were vital to the operation of the hub. They largely operated the depots, bakeries, laundries, etc. in cities like Maastricht, Heerlen and Sittard as well as in smaller rural towns. Trucks chauffeured by African Americans brought supplies to the front.

More to the north, they supported the 7th Armored Division, which fought the bloody Battle of Overloon. African American units also provided support to the airborne operations during and in the aftermath of Operation Market Garden, which took place in September 1944.

The most gruesome work was done by the men of the 960th and 3136th Quartermaster Service Companies, who had been tasked with digging graves at the military cemetery in Margraten. Staff Sergeant Jefferson Wiggins remembered: 'In all the eight, nine, sometimes ten hours a day we were digging there, there was fear in the air. Or maybe it was sadness. Every day was the same. Yet you didn’t get used to it.'

African American soldiers often had to deal with blatant racism from their fellow countrymen. Corporal Rupert Trimmingham wrote to Yank Magazine, describing how he and his fellow soldiers would not be served or even be allowed in establishments when they were on the road in the United States, while German prisoners of war were seated and served at the table.

It led Trimmingham to ask: 'Are these men sworn enemies of this country? Are they not taught to hate and destroy all democratic governments? Are we not American soldiers, sworn to fight for and die if need be for this country? Then why are they treated better than we are?'

Corporal James Baldwin, who served with the 784th Tank Battalion in the Netherlands, remembered that 'white soldiers said that we had tails.' These rumours were efforts to maintain the racial status quo overseas by soldiers themselves, complementing official policies.

African American soldiers not only served in segregated units, they also were quartered separately and supposed to use separate facilities for rest and recreation.

Failure to maintain the status quo caused tensions. 'It meant trouble when a Black soldier was seen with a white girl. And locals invited us to their homes or to go to a café with them, angering white soldiers,' Corporal Baldwin recollected.

Mieke Verkuyl, who was 12 years old at the time, invited some African American soldiers to have a drink in her father’s café in Valkenburg. Reluctantly, they entered. Angry, the white soldiers started swearing and forced them out.

Despite this, there were friendly encounters between locals and soldiers, and long-lasting friendships were founded. Out of some relationships, children were born.

'We totally did not feel superior towards our Black liberators,' said Clim Daemen, a 12 year  old boy in Maastricht at the time. 'That is why my mum and dad welcomed these soldiers at their home, even though it was the first time they had seen people of colour.' They tried to overcome the language barrier. 'My mother spoke French, but no English.' So, when Alex Brothers, one of their regular visitors stops by again, she says 'faites comme home,' make yourself at home. Alex was 'a friendly, easy boy with a contagious laugh,' Clim remembered.

Not every African American soldier felt at home, nor were they seen as equals by everyone.

African American soldiers complained about Black Pete, a blackface character that serves as the helper of Saint Nicholas. A promise was made that the figure would not be seen as long as African American soldiers were in the country.

Some newspapers in Limburg felt the need to run articles on how to address these soldiers. One article discussed the use of the term Black people, of which 'you might not know that this term has an unsympathetic meaning.”

It is true that many Europeans had never personally met people of colour before, and their thoughts were shaped by colonial imagery. Many locals recollected how the soldiers were, at least initially, seen as ‘exotic’ and, therefore, interesting.

But while how these soldiers were treated may have in part been caused by ignorance, the articles also allude to a bigger issue: racism. One article called out the false rumours and stories that the people of Limburg were spreading. In another article, the author recalls how African American soldiers were turned away when looking for billeting, because there was no space. Soon after, white soldiers were welcomed.

When asked why, the answer was: “African Americans are not as civilised”. The author wondered whether “the way we treat blacks is any different than the racism of the Nazis.”

'That was how it was in those days,' Jefferson Wiggins sighed. 'And that is how it still sometimes is today.' He wondered whether Europeans ever saw African Americans as equals. 'I am sure that our role in the liberation was appreciated, but without a gun, you were not considered a real liberator.'

Even though he was forced to sit in a dirty, segregated train wagon again when he got back home, by then he had been promoted to first lieutenant, he knew change was to come. 'We no longer accepted that we were treated as belonging to some kind of inferior human species. I think every Black American who had witnessed the war in Europe was determined to bring change upon coming home.' It was time for victory at home.

Stories from last year’s residency

This year's theme

A special 3D resource

Mentors

Online info session - 21 February 2024

Our 2024 residency has a new theme, new formats and new mentors - find out what it’s all about and how you can apply!

Every year, the Europeana Initiative runs a Digital Storytelling Festival. This international event encourages cultural heritage professionals, educators, creatives, and students from Europe and beyond to boost their storytelling skills and tell stories exploring culture. Our Online Creative Residency is now a key part of the festival.

The residency brings students and new professionals who want to gain storytelling skills in a professional setting together with experts in a range of formats. Last year, participants explored stories in writing, social media and animation, and this year, we’re introducing two new formats - collage art and storytelling with 3D - and we’re looking for creative, enthusiastic and committed participants to join us!

In 2023, residency participants worked with specialist mentors to produce writing, social media posts and animations celebrating queer stories, narratives and cultural heritage from all around Europe. All their stories were added to ourLGBTQ+ page.

This was an opportunity to have their work published, as well as a chance to explore queer culture. For some, it was a way to feel accepted within that culture. One participant, Aida Naasan Agha Spyridopoulou, told us that, ‘Being part of the queer narrative through a creative process made me feel part of queer culture, and doing so made me feel more comfortable with my queer identity and my sexuality. In the end, feeling you have a queer heritage is very important.’

Our theme this year is ‘Journey’. That might bring up thoughts of travel, holidays, or the juxtaposition of destination and home. It might lead to personal or reflective journeys, or maybe invoke stories about journeys taken using various modes of transport, and the interesting people met along the way. 
Will we see famous historical journeys reflected in our residency stories? Or find out about solo adventurers or group migrations? Residency stories might be factual, fictional, personal or political - we can’t wait to find out!

Residency participants will use the openly licensed material available on the Europeana website to illustrate or inspire their creations in all the format categories.

This year, we have a new set of 3D items that we would love participants to explore. This set of 3D items comes from a campaign calledTwin it!, in which every European Union member state is digitising one or more cultural heritage items (buildings, statues, objects) and making them available on the Europeana website. We hope that these will be available from March onwards to be included in the residency.

This year, we have six mentors! Beth Daley (writing), Carola Carlino and Marianna Marcucci (social media) and Nick Cave (animation) are returning, having enjoyed the residency so much last year. And they are joined by Cosmina Berta (collage art) and one more mentor (details to come soon) who will lead our storytelling in 3D strand.

Cosmina says, ‘I am thrilled about the opportunity to take part in the upcoming residency and mentor the collage art group! Collaborating with the participants and guiding them through workshops is a chance to share my passion for collage art using Europeana material and hopefully inspire their creative journeys. Our time together is an exciting prospect that resonates with my dedication for creative discovery and self-expression.’

In this event, we'll showcase last year's Creative Online Residency, have some creative fun together and tell you everything you need to know about the application process for this year.

We hope you'll join us, although please note, everyone can apply for the residency - so don't worry if you can't make it to the info session. A recording will be made available of this session after the event.

Celebrating Saint Brigid today

How a 5th century saint from Ireland is celebrated today

Saint Brigid's Day is celebrated on 1 February, and has been marked in Ireland for many years. Saint Brigid is the only female among Ireland's three patron saints. She is also a patron saint of healers, poets, beer, blacksmiths and dairy workers, as well as a figure associated with creativity and womanhood.

Let's look at the life of Saint Brigid and find out the traditions that celebrate her life and legacy.

Brigid has been many things to many people - the accounts of her early life are debated in many differing biographies, myths and legends.

In general, it's agreed that she was born in the 5th century. She is said to be the daughter of a chieftain and an enslaved woman who had been baptised bySaint Patrick.

Some biographies say that she spent her youth as a farm worker. For the first eighteen years of her life, Brigid was an enslaved worker alongside her mother. Already in her youth, she is credited as having performed some miracles.

Brigid also shares her name with a Celtic goddess of pre-Christian Ireland. This deity was a goddess of inspiration, creativity, the arts, childbirth, and healing. There is some speculation over whether the 5th century Brigid existed at all, with theories that she was invented to Christianise the old Celtic goddess, while others suggesting she was simply named after her.

Around 480, Brigid founded a monastery at Kildare. This is a site that is now a town to the west ofDublin(though that city was not founded until a few centuries later).

The monastery was founded on the site of a shrine to the Celtic goddess Brigid, under a large oak tree. In Irish, Kildare isCill Dhara, which translates as 'the church of the oak'.

Along with a group of seven companions, Brigid developed the site at Kildare. She is often credited as founding a convent, which was the first communal consecrated religious site for women in Ireland.

Over the years, Brigid's site in Kildare became a centre of religion and learning, and Kildare developed into a cathedral city.

She is said to have founded a school of art, which producedmanuscripts, metalwork and more.

Biographers write of Brigid's travels across Ireland and to sites in England.

Many miracles are attributed to her, often around healing and charitable acts to deserving people. One miracle says that she transformed a lake into beer to serve a leper colony which had run out of beer. Her prayers were said to calm winds and stop rain.

Brigid is believed to have died on 1 February 525. This day is now celebrated as Saint Brigid's Day - the first mention of this was in the 7th century. It was also the date of Imbolc, a pre-Christian seasonal festival which marked the beginning of spring.

Many traditions have developed around Saint Brigid's Day.

In Kildare, a sacred fire was said to burn continuously in Saint Brigid's honour. The original flame extinguished in the 16th century. A more modern tradition inspired by this ancient custom has emerged. In 1993, a flame was lit again. Each year since, people come to take a flame back to their communities - representing the light and warmth of Saint Brigid spreading throughout the country.

People often celebrate Brigid by participating in creative activities, music, storytelling and artistic expressions that pay homage to her creative spirit.

In some parts ofIreland, there have been parades dedicated to Biddy (Saint Brigid), which can include making and carrying Saint Brigid's Crosses.

The Saint Brigid's Cross is the symbol most associated with Saint Brigid.

Traditionally made from rushes or straw, it is woven into a distinctive four-armed design - though there are many regional variations.

The cross is believed to protect homes from harm and evil spirits. Many households in Ireland still craft and hang Saint Brigid's Crosses on the eve of her feast day to bless their homes. It was common to give a St Brigid’s Cross as a gift to newlyweds and those buying a new home, to offer protection and to wish the couple well in starting a family.

Today, many churches are dedicated to Saint Brigid as well as Saint Bride, a shortened and Anglicised form of her name. Placenames, including East Kilbride, Rathbride and more, take their name from Saint Brigid.

In 2023, the first Monday in February became a public holiday in Ireland to honour Saint Brigid. It is the first Irish public holiday named after a woman. Many festivals and organisations take the opportunity on this holiday to celebratewomen's achievements and creativity.

How the Fuggers shaped cities

Kingmaker

Deals with the devil - and the Pope

After the Fuggers

The story of the Fugger family, who controlled Europe's economy and society in the 15th and 16th centuries

Jakob 'the Rich' Fugger and his family were bankers and merchants who controlled much of Europe's economy in the 15th and 16th centuries. One of Europe's wealthiest families, the Fuggers created kings, gave life to cities and led to a split within the Church.

Originating in the Bavarian city Augsburg, they accumulated enormous wealth and controlled a significant amount of trade, particularly in mining.

This blog introduces some stories of the Fugger family from across Europe, in particular looking at Jakob Fugger 'the Rich' who is considered to be one of the wealthiest people ever to have lived.

The Fugger fortune stemmed from their textile and weaving businesses, in addition to their banking activities.

The many branches of the Fugger family amassed their fortunes by trading in a diversity of products: textiles, spices, jewels, and even religious relics such as martyrs' bones and fragments of crosses. By expanding his capital in the late 15th century, Jakob 'the Rich' became the banker for increasingly affluent individuals.

However, it was the family’s involvement in mining that significantly expanded their wealth, as rulers offered them mining rights inHungaryand Tyrol as a form of debt repayment.

In Schwaz, Tyrol, Archduke Sigismund ofAustriaoffered Jakob 'the mother of all silver mines' as a repayment for a loan which had funded his lavish lifestyle.

Due to the Fuggers’ industrial activities, people flocked to Schwaz, making it the largestminingmetropolis in the world in the first half of the 16th century.

The population boomed, which meant that the parish church in Schwaz had to be enlarged. A brick wall in the central aisle was built to separate miners from wealthier individuals.

In Augsburg, the Fugger family's hometown, Jakob established one of his most renowned philanthropic endeavours: theFuggerei.

Founded in 1521, the Fuggerei provided affordable housing for the city's poorest citizens at a cost of one florin (equivalent to 0.88 euros) per year, along with the obligation to offer three prayers for Jakob.

Remarkably, the rent has remained unchanged to this day. It remains the oldest existing example of social housing.

Banská Štiavnica is one of the one of the most important cities in CentralSlovakia, it is included on the UNESCO World Heritage List because of its uniqueness. For centuries, it has been the site of mines, yielding copper, silver, and gold that were traded throughout Europe.

From 1495, many mines in the area of Banská Štiavnica and the nearby Banská Bystrica were controlled by the Fugger family. They controlled the 16th century copper trade - copper was a highly valuable resource, as it was essential for producing cannons and bayonets.

The Fuggers were one of the most influential families of the era. Jakob 'the Rich' is considered one of the wealthiest individuals in history, with an estimated fortune equivalent to 400 billion euros today. With this great wealth came great power.

Jakob supported Maximilian I of Habsburg in his accession to the Holy Roman Emperor throne by paying 800,000 florins. While this might be seen as corruption by today's standards, it was customary for rulers of that time to demonstrate their economic power by offering such payments to elector princes.

Jakob was known for being a businessman who regularly chased his debts and would often send letters demanding repayment.

In 1523, he wrote a letter demanding a payment not to the spice trader who owed him money, but toCharles V of Habsburg, then the most powerful man on Earth. Charles V - the grandson of Maximilian I - held 81 titles, including Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, King of Spain, King of Naples, King of Jerusalem, Duke of Burgundy, and Lord of Asia and Africa. People considered Charles V to be divine and tried to touch him because of his supposed healing abilities.

In his letter, Jakob reminded him 'It is worth noting that His Majesty would not have the imperial crown without me. You must calculate the money you owe me and pay me without further delay.'

The Fuggers served as bankers to Popes, financing projects like the Sistine Chapel.

They managed the sale ofindulgences, which were a way to reduce punishments for sins committed. Criticism of this system contributed to the Protestant Reformation led by Martin Luther. Their trade in indulgences led to accusations that the Fugger family had connections to the devil.

The Fugger family were attracted to Trento, a city inItalywhich played a pivotal role as a trade hub connecting northern Europe, Spain and Venice.

They owned a palace in the city known as 'the Devil's Palace'. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe recounted the legend behind its name: when Georg Fugger arrived in Trento in early 1600, he fell in love with the noble Elena Madruzzo. However, her parents would only consent to their marriage if Georg had a beautiful house in Trento. Georg supposedly invoked the devil, who constructed the palace in a single night.

The Fugger family's influence waned over the generations. In 1657, the Fuggers’ company came to an end.

The resources of Banská Bystrica had been depleted by the Fuggers' mining operations, resulting in a decline in global interest and the depopulation of the region from the end of the 16th century.

Today, the mines and mining villages of Central Slovakia play an important part in promoting the country'shistory and heritage of miningin light of a new wave of cultural tourism.

Who was Hendrick Avercamp?

What were Hendrick Avercamp's frozen landscape paintings?

Painting in the 'Little Ice Age' and the so-called 'Golden Age'

What were the influences and techniques in Avercamp's paintings?

Exploring the Dutch artist's frozen landscape paintings

Hendrick Avercamp's 1608 artwork Winter Landscape with Ice Skaters has been a popular painting for centuries. Art lovers over the years have been charmed by its skating figures and their antics, whether funny, domestic or risqué.

Often confused with artworks by Bruegels, Avercamp specialised in painting winter scenes.

Let's take a look at the life of Hendrick Avercamp.

Hendrick Avercamp was born in Amsterdam in 1585. He moved to Kampen as a child when his father was appointed as the town's apothecary.

Avercamp was born with adisability- he was non-verbal and it is assumed he was deaf. In several documents, Avercamp is mentioned as 'the Kampen Mute' ('de Stomme van Kampen').

His mother taught him to write, but through his drawings and paintings we see Avercamp's creative skill.

When he was 12, Avercamp started taking drawing lessons locally. Aged 18, he moved toAmsterdamwhere he trained with the Danish artist Pieter Isaacsz.

In Amsterdam, Avercamp encountered and was influenced by the work of Flemish landscape painters such asGillis van Coninxloo IIIandDavid Vinckboons.

These landscape paintings influenced Avercamp's own works. Over time, he became known for highly-detailed winter landscape paintings.

Avercamp's paintings were more than just frozen snapshots - they were vibrant and full of life.

His scenes show crowds of people engaged in various activities: skating, sledding, and playing games amidst the frozen landscapes. He captured the bustling atmosphere of winter leisure with a sense of joy and fun. Some are doing more naughty activities: throwing snowballs, making fun of others and urinating.

Painted at the beginning of the 17th century, his artworks reflect the creativity, optimism and a sense of Dutch identity that arose when Holland became independent from Spain, the start of a time often described as the Dutch Golden Age of art and culture.

His paintings reveal a lot about life then inthe Netherlandsand how the Dutch adapted to harsh weather conditions in what was known as theLittle Ice Age. This was a time of cooler climates and weather, at various periods during the 16th to 19th centuries.

The last quarter of the 16th century, during which Avercamp was born, was one of Western Europe's coldest periods in the Little Ice Age.

Winterssaw more snow and ice, often starting as early as November and lasting until March or April. Canals and rivers were frequently frozen deeply enough to support ice skating and winter festivals.

Avercamp's paintings were composed in a studio, based on watercolours and studies.

To focus on the activity on the frozen ice, Avercamp uses a high perspective - a style which follows Flemish landscape painting.

He also uses a technique called aerial or atmospheric perspective which suggests distance - figures in the foreground are painted more vividly and those in the background are painted with lighter colours.

Avercamp's paintings were popular in his day, selling for high prices. Avercamp passed away in 1634 at the age of 48. His paintings have remained as popular throughout the centuries as in his time.

Hi, Cosmina. Tell us a bit about yourself and how you got into creating art.

What has been your best find on Europeana.eu so far?

How do you use Europeana.eu?

Where else do you find or share your inspiration?

What is influencing your work right now?

Cosmina Berta uses Europeana's rich resources to craft new art and narratives that inspire audiences and generate commercial success.

Artist Cosmina Berta tells us how she browses the Europeana website for artistic inspiration. Cosmina bases her artworks on cultural heritage imagery, enhancing and reimagining it using both digital and traditional techniques.

For me, art is more than a hobby. I grew up in communist Romania when artists had to teach in schools. So we had very famous artists teaching us and I was inspired by them and their passion. One teacher came to school and drew magic birds from stories, and I started to draw like she did. I never stopped.

I’m from Romania and I came to live in Germany in 2000. I think of myself as a European citizen. When I came to Germany, I was a bit lonely and art was my refuge. I started working for the German Digital Library and discovered its pictures, and Europeana.eu’s too. I was practically amazed by these pictures, and I wanted to show them to the world, to give them new life, to craft a dialogue between the past and the present. I also learn a lot myself about the events and the people shown in the pictures.

In 2013, I saw some Europeana blogs that used fashion photos from Gallica - I loved the style, the dressing, the atmosphere - and so I started digging. And I found more things I liked. I found pictures taken by a press agency in the 1910s-20s. The flavour of the pictures was so different then. Such as pictures taken during a solar eclipse with people silhouetted against the sky. I mixed them with patterns and made collages that I transferred onto wooden panels I’d found. Wood is organic and warm, it has its own story. Gallica has restrictions on how you can use their collections, so I got in touch with them to clarify how I could use them in my art. I put five pictures in a coffee shop and I sold four of them.

One buyer studied geography and saw contour lines of topographic maps in the pattern I added. She saw something in it that I hadn’t.

Then I started adding stories to the pictures and in 2020, just before the pandemic, I did my first art show, with three stories about three pictures. One of these was about a ship. I added a red pattern to its sails andthe storyis about how the ship lost its sails.

A set of portraitsof Michel Fokine, a choreographer. When he died in 1942, his choreography for Les Sylphides was performed in 17 opera houses around the world as a tribute to him. He worked in the 1920s, 30s and 40s and his work is still being used today,  but I imagine people have forgotten the man behind the dances. I added harlequin patterns and colours to his portrait because I thought it should be colourful and happy. I could work in so many ways with the five or six photos there are of him. I could do an art show just with him.

I also love the pattern papers featured ina blog about booksthat had been restored. I combined one of these with a portrait of three sisters. The person I sold this to said it reminded them of a feminist version of Lenin, Marx and Engels. I love how other people see things that I don’t see. It’s fascinating. These pictures are so relatable, they communicate,  and people see a story and relate it to themselves.

I like Europeana.eu because I don’t have to search for things on ten different websites. Everything is there. I know how to use the facets and the search and the rights statements. You have to find stuff that clicks for you, and it clicks very often with the pictures in Europeana.

I like looking through the blogs, and when I search, I start very broadly looking for all images with an open licence. That’s it. Then I go with the flow.

I don’t follow people on social media. I follow museums. Every visit to an art show or to a museum changes my direction a little bit.

As do conversations with people. A friend of mine’s house flooded, and she gave me a piece of floorboard that had been damaged in the flood. I transferred a collage of butterflies onto it and made it optimistic and colourful. I wanted her to have something bright to take away the bad memories.

Sometimes I like to let technique take control. I work with Photoshop to cut out images and it can see nuances of colour that I cannot see, so I let the software do it. It’s a combination between human and machine and this works very well for me.

I use Photoshop and Illustrator to work with the images, and I likeMediumfor sharing my stories. I also share my work onInstagram, and my art is listed on theSaatchi Artwebsite but I don’t have my own website.

I also work in a gallery with 10 people. Everyone’s styles are very different but we inspire each other a lot, in how we use patterns, various techniques, or in the harmony of colours. It’s good to be in a community and to have that exchange of ideas. And it’s great to have input from the people who look at the pictures. It’s like reading tea leaves, I read one thing and someone else reads something else.

I’d say 90% of my art is of women. One series is based on pictures from a Europeana blog featuring images of women on a seashore. I used them to make pictures that I found optimistic and uplifting.

But people still need to fight for their rights. In the 2000s we all thought we had gained some ground, but apparently not. I want to communicate this in my art. I want to convey energy, freedom, reflection, hope, inspiration! In my collages with old masters like Rembrandt, I noticed that most women are looking down, they’re very submissive. I’m doing a series now with pictures from the 1930s and 40s because they are starting to be released with open licences. They  have a different atmosphere, they’re communicating differently - the women in the pictures from these times are starting not to look down any more.

The rediscovered city

Objects and people

Bibracte today

Discover the past and present history of a major European archaeological site in Burgundy

Bibracte is an archaeological site in the French region, Burgundy. Located on Mont Beuvray, it was the capital of the Aedui, a Gallic tribe that lived during the late  Iron Age and the beginning of Roman period.

A few decades after the Roman conquest of Gaul during the Gallic Wars, Bibracte was abandoned by its inhabitants, who moved to Autun, the new capital of the region built by the Roman administration 20km away from the Bibracte site.

Bibracte remained undisturbed and unexamined, lying under vast woodland.

It was discovered by archaeologists in the 19th century, then abandoned again after 1914, before being revived in 1984 with the resumption of large-scale archaeological excavations. Since then,a museum and research centre have been constructed at Bibracte, where the archaeology of tomorrow is being developed!

At 821 metres, Mont Beuvray is the third-highest peak in the Morvan, a small mountain range in Burgundy.

The meadows at the summit of Mont Beuvray were used to graze cattle until the 19th century. The boundaries of the pastoral and agricultural space can still be seen in the rows of queules, twisted trees that are the remains of ancient folded hedges. The view from the summit makes it a top-rated destination for hikers.

Except for a few clearings, the mountain is now completely covered in woodland. Its majestic beech forest is a major contribution to the heritage value of the site.

Because of the importance of its archaeological remains and the quality of its landscape, Mont Beuvray is protected as both a cultural heritage site (a historic monument) and a natural heritage site (a listed site). In 2008, it was awarded the 'Grand Site de France' label, which recognises the quality of the site's sustainable management.

When Emperor Napoleon III wanted to write a history of Julius Caesar, research was undertaken to locate Alesia, Gergovia and Bibracte, Gallic strongholds that had played a major role in the Gallic Wars. Bibracte is mentioned in Julius Caesar'sDe Bello Gallico, his treatise on the Gallic Wars, as the main town of the Aedui, a Celtic people of great importance.

However, its precise location had been lost over time and, from the Renaissance onwards, scholars began to wonder whether it was Mont Beuvray or Autun. Both locations can be found right above the word 'AEDUI' on the map below.

Long-term archaeological explorations by local scholar Jacques-Gabriel Bulliot began in 1865 and lasted more than three decades. These quickly demonstrated that Bibracte and Mont Beuvray were one and the same.

Bulliot's successor, Joseph Déchelette, one of the fathers of European protohistoricarchaeology, took over at the turn of the 20th century.

Observing that the remains of the structures found on Mont Beuvray had been the blueprint for identical structures found in Bavaria, Hungary and Bohemia, he realised that Bibracte was the point of emergence of a Europe-wide urban phenomenon.

However, the excavations stopped after the death of Joseph Déchelette in 1914 and Bibracte gradually fell into oblivion. It was not until 1984 that a vast research programme in collaboration with researchers from all over Europe was re-launched at the instigation of the President of France, François Mitterrand.

Excavations carried out since the 19th century have fully revealed the importance of Bibracte as not just a settlement but an oppidum, a large fortified town.

As an oppidum, its urban framework was initially formed by two ramparts. The first dates from the second half of the 2nd century BC. It was 7 kilometres long and was quickly replaced by a second, which was 5.2 kilometres long. Their gates are linked to a road system organised around a main artery and secondary streets that distribute public spaces, workshops and numerous houses.

The building techniques, plans and decorations reveal the influence of the Roman empire in the area. This began just after the Gallic War, particularly in the form of a group of monuments which have been interpreted by scholars as being a forum and domus built on a plan that was typical of Roman Italy.

As well as uncovering the urban remains, hundreds of thousands of objects have been discovered on the site since the 19th century.

Those from the earliest excavations are now divided between theRolin Museum in Autunand theNational Archaeology Museum in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, while more recent finds are kept in the European Archaeological Centre's archives.

Nearly 2,000 objects are on display at the Bibracte museum. Studied and restored by various specialists, they provide irreplaceable evidence of life in the oppidum.

The many objects from everyday life illustrate, among other things, how food was prepared, such as by hand-operated rotary millstones, which were owned by every household.

The care Bibracte's inhabitants took with their appearance is evident in the variety of objects they used to adorn themselves.

There are a large number of fibulae (brooches for fastening garments), reflecting the specific skills of the oppidum's craftsmen. While wine amphorae (two-handled storage jars) were the main items that were imported to Bibracte, rarer items such as amber and pigments point to more complex and extensive trade routes.

Finally, several objects, such as writing tools, weapons and luxury items, reveal the presence of an elite. Others, such as a sculpted head, religious dedications and ex-votos are evidence of religious  practices that were also in the process of being Romanised.

The European Archaeological Centre, which is adjacent to the site, welcomes researchers and students who have come to take part in the exploration of Mont Beuvray or to take advantage of its extensive library.

Over the years, it has become a centre for experimenting with new techniques in archaeology, particularly in the field of digital technology. The Bibracte museum, welcoming 50,000 visitors a year, is an unrivalled place to discover a little-known chapter in European history and learn about diverse archaeological methods.

The EUreka3D project enables the most representative objects discovered at Bibracte to be digitised in three dimensions so that they can be shared on Europeana.

This blog is part of theEUreka3D project, which aims to build the capacity of small cultural heritage institutions in digital transformation, particularly on issues related to 3D digitisation.

Bad Ischl, Austria

Bodø, Norway

Tartu, Estonia

Cities in Austria, Estonia and Norway hold the title

Each year, the European Capitals of Culture programme celebrates the rich tapestry of cultural heritage across Europe, showcasing the historical significance, cultural lives and artistic legacies of different cities and regions.

In 2024, the spotlight falls on Bad Ischl in Austria, Bodø in Norway and Tartu in Estonia.European Capitals of Culturedon't have to be big, busy cities - this year, three of the smallest places in the programme's history hold the title.

Each place encapsulates a unique blend of heritage, history, and artistic innovation, offering a glimpse into Europe's vibrant heritage. Let's make a virtual visit to each one and explore their cultural heritage.

Bad Ischl is located within the alpine Salzkammergut region of Austria. It is made up of 23 municipalities, and together they hold the 'Capital of Culture' title.

Bad Ischl is a spa town renowned for its imperial history. In 1849, Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria chose the town to be his summer residence. Its elegant architecture and picturesque landscapes reflect the opulence and grandeur of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy.

Franz Joseph and his wifeEmpress Elisabeth of Austria (known as Sisi)spent their summers in the mansion Kaiservilla.

It was in this villa in 1914 that Franz Joseph signed Austria-Hungary's declaration of war against the Kingdom of Serbia, which beganWorld War I.

But the region was important long before World War I. It has a rich Bronze and Iron Age heritage.

So much so that the lakeside village of Hallstatt gave its name to an entire epoch of the Iron Age - the period referred to as Hallstatt culture (850 to 500 BCE). In the 19th century, an excavation of a large prehistoric cemetery revealed tools and other artefacts relating to nearby salt mines.

The region has inspired many artists, most notablyGustav Klimt who spent summers at the lake Attersee, painting many artworks inspired by the lake's natural surroundings.

Salzkammergut's European Capital of Culture plans are focused on four areas: Power and tradition, Culture in motion, Sharing Salzkammergut and 'Globalokal'. Through these activities,Salzkammergut 2024aims to connect prehistoric, imperial and more recent history to the future.

Every three years, localities from countries outside the European Union are invited to bid for the European Capital of Culture title. Bodø is a town in the north of Norway, and is the most northerly place to hold the European Capital of Culture title.

Bodø is set among breathtaking landscapes above the Arctic Circle and has a population of around 50,000.

It developed from a village to a town in the early 19th century, due to its fishing and maritime industries. Bodø also has a Royal Norwegian Air Force base, and is the location of theNorwegian Aviation Museum.

Today, Bodø is home toFram Kino, the first cinema in Norway which opened in 1908. It also boasts football clubBodø/Glimt, the most northerly club to win a European national league competition. They won the Eliteserien, the championship of Norway, in 2020, 2021 and 2023.

In 2024, more than 1,000 events will take place inBodøand across the Nordland region, with a focus on young people.

In Bodø, these will be centred on Stormen, a concert hall, theatre and library, which opened in 2014.

Tartu is the second city of Estonia, and known as its intellectual capital. The University of Tartu, founded in 1632, is Estonia's oldest university.

Tartu's history dates back to the 5th century. By the 7th century, fortifications had been built on Toome Hill and, in medieval times, a bishop's castle was also located there.

Today, landmarks such as Tartu Cathedral, the Supreme Court of Estonia and Angel's Bridge are located on Toome Hill.

Over the centuries, Tartu has been ruled by Sweden, Poland and Russia and so has been known by several names - Tarbatu, Dorpat and Yuryev. Since Estonia's independence in 1918, the city has settled on the name Tartu.

Tartu has a vibrant cultural scene. TheTartu Art Museumshowcases a diverse collection of Estonian art, reflecting the nation's artistic progression through different eras. It is home to theEstonian Sports and Olympic Museumand theTartu City Museum.

TheVanemuine Theatrewas founded in 1870, and is one of the oldest theatres in Estonia.

In 2024,Tartuplans a series of events, exhibitions and activities relating to the concept 'Arts of Survival'. More than 1,000 events will take place, sharing stories about the knowledge, skills, and values that will help us lead a good life in the future.

In Krakow, Poland, making nativity scenes is seen as a cultural tradition going back centuries.

A nativity scene is a traditionally Christian display of the birth of Jesus. It often shows a manger with baby Jesus, surrounded by Maria and Joseph, barn animals, and the three wise men that come and bring gifts to the newborn prophet. Nativity scenes come in all shapes and sizes: they might be life-sized, using actors to represent the protagonists, or they might be tiny wooden scenes made to display in a living room.

In Krakow in Poland, making nativity scenes is seen as a cultural tradition going back centuries. The Krakow nativity scene, as a cultural phenomenon, was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2014. They contain selected fragments of Krakow's architecture, in which people associated with Christmas are placed, as well as fictitious characters from legends.

This tradition was initiated by bricklayers who sometimes could not do their work erecting buildings when the weather was too bad. This was especially true in autumn and winter. So they started to create small substitute buildings instead, like nativity scenes, that they could sell at local markets. They also created large moving cribs, which acted as a puppet show of sorts with which they carolled around homes to get some income during their unemployment.

In 1937, on the initiative of the director of the Historical Museum of the City of Krakow, competitions for the most beautiful Krakow nativity scene began to be organized. In 2022, the 80th edition of the competition took place, the results of which are always solemnly presented in front of the monument of the national poet Adam Mickiewicz.

Nativity scene makers taking part in competitions create their works for many months, reproducing in detail the rich architecture of Krakow. However, their nativity scenes are a product of the creator's imagination and a stylistic mix. The best example of cultivating this tradition is the Malik family from the Zwierzyniec district of Krakow, which has been participating in this phenomenal project for the fourth generation, winning numerous awards.

Stanisław Malik

Stanisław Malik received the Honoris Gratia medal in 2022 for numerous award-winning works that he has been creating since 1978. His nativity scenes have won prizes in more than 27 competitions. In 2018 Stanisław received one of his most treasured prizes, the honorary badge "Meritorious for Polish Culture" awarded by the Minister of Culture.

His works are present in many Polish museums, as well as in foreign institutions and private collections. Nativity scenes in the Malik family are a tradition initiated by grandfather Walenty, cultivated by Włodzimierz, Stanisław's father, and now continued by his son Andrzej.

One of the most common motifs Stanisław incorporates in his nativity scenes is the churches of Kraków: the soaring towers of St. Mary's Church or the golden domes of the Sigismund Chapel in the Wawel Cathedral. His nativity scenes are made of wood, cardboard and tin foil. They sparkle with numerous colours, among which the dominant colour is the red colour of the Gothic bricks of Krakow's buildings.

Włodzimierz Malik

Stanisław's father, Włodzimierz Malik (1912-1990), became interested in creating nativity scenes at the age of 4, watching his father's work. In Włodzimierz's nativity scenes, apart from the Holy Family, the 16th-century nobleman Twardowski is often present, who, according to legend, was the first to land on the moon. His nativity scenes were also awarded numerous times. In 1959 he received a gold badge from the Presidium of the National Council of the City of Krakow, awarded "For social work for the city of Krakow".

Walenty Malik

Walenty Malik, Stanisław's grandfather, was the first nativity scene maker in the family. He created large nativity scenes, often more than two meters high. His work were used to put on display in parishes, and at the Krakow Industrial Museum. He even lugged these scenes around to go carolling!

Andrzej Malik

Andrzej Malik made his first nativity scene at the age of 10. He's the youngest in the family, being born in 1990. Andrzej specializes in smaller nativity scenes, but he also does not avoid larger installations. He mostly plays with Gothic architecture, but he is also inspired by the works of the artist of the Secession period, Stanisław Wyspiański (1869 - 1907). Especially Wyspiański's stained glass windows fascinate him. In 2020, Andrzej Malik received the Creative Scholarship of the City of Krakow. He's also run workshops for creating nativity scenes for children in Frankfurt and Orléans.

Why were the first jigsaw puzzles invented?

How did jigsaw puzzles develop?

How did jigsaws become more popular?

Competitive puzzling

From an invention by a London cartographer to competitive puzzling championships

Jigsaw puzzles have been a beloved toy for centuries, captivating both young and old across the globe. This blog looks at the history of jigsaw puzzles, from their origins in the 18th century until today.

The origins of the jigsaw puzzle can be traced back to the 18th century.

European mapmakers mounted their maps onto wood and cut them into small pieces to create educational tools for teaching geography. These were used to familiarise children with the world's geography in a fun and interactive way.

London cartographer John Spilsbury is often credited with making the first commercial jigsaw puzzle. In the 1760s, he sold puzzles with world maps cut into wooden pieces along country boundaries. At the time, these were known as 'dissected maps'.

Over time, jigsaw puzzles expanded from featuring maps to including paintings, scenes from the Bible, landscapes and various other scenes.

Initially, as they were crafted by hand in wood, they were considered to be both luxury and educational items. Puzzles on cardboard first appeared in the early 1800s but were not popular initially, as both producers and customers perceived them as being of lower quality.

During the 19th century, industrial advancements led to jigsaw puzzles becoming more mass produced.

The jigsaw - a vertical saw moving up and down and capable of cutting out intricate shapes - was invented in 1855. It was also known as a fretsaw or scrollsaw.

It's hard to say exactly when but around 1880, the name 'jigsaw' began being associated with the puzzle, named after this tool for cutting the shapes. The term 'jigsaw puzzle' is generally believed to date to the early 1900s.

By the beginning of the 20th century, jigsaw puzzles were being produced both on wood and on cardboard.

Over the next few decades, cardboard became the major material for jigsaw puzzles, making them more popular and accessible. Jigsaw puzzles also developed new features such as more intricate interlocking pieces.

In the 1880s, two companies were founded which would become the market leaders in jigsaw puzzles.

The American company Parker Brothers - whogave the world the game Monopoly- was founded in Massachusetts in 1883. They marketed their first jigsaw puzzle in 1887.

German game company Ravensburger was also founded in 1883, but did not start to produce jigsaw puzzles until the 1960s. They are now the leading makers of jigsaw puzzles in Europe.

By the 1930s, companies were using jigsaw puzzles as advertisements, giving them away to customers with products.

In particular, during the economic hardships in the 1930s, jigsaw puzzles surged in popularity as an affordable form of entertainment.

Over the years since, jigsaw puzzles have remained a popular toy. In particular, during the Coronavirus pandemic, jigsaw puzzles became a perfect past-time while staying indoors.

While most people play jigsaw puzzles to relax and be inspired by beautiful paintings, some take it more seriously and have made jigsaw puzzling into a competition.

Since 2019, theWorld Jigsaw Puzzles Championshipshave been held in Valladolid, Spain, with team and individual competitions.

The first championship had more than 1,000 competitors from 40 countries, all competing to complete a jigsaw puzzle in the fastest time. In 2023, the individual competition winner Alejandro Clemente León completed a 500 piece jigsaw in just under 38 minutes!

So, now you know about the history of jigsaw puzzles, how about playing some?

Apple of my eye

Apple phrases in English and other languages

Unique apple phrases

How apples found their way into everyday language from Shakespeare to Cockney rhyming slang

How far does the apple fall from the tree? Should you avoid comparing apples with pears or oranges? Apples appear in our everyday language no matter what language we speak. Explore some uses you’ll know and discover some you might not!

Let’s start with ‘the apple of my eye’. This phrase is used several times in the Old Testament, for example in Proverbs 7:2: ‘Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.’ It means something, or someone, that you care deeply about.

Its origins may be from a Hebrew phrase meaning ‘little man of the eye’, referring to the reflection of yourself you see in other people’s eyes - expressing the idea that you are held close or cherished by that person.

Shakespeare famously used the phrase too, but interestingly, he used it without that romantic meaning of care, closeness and love. In Shakespeare’s day, there was no word for the pupil in an eye, and the phrase ‘apple of the eye’ was used as an anatomical reference, because apples are round and so is the black hole in your eye! So inA Midsummer Night’s Dream, when Shakespeare wrote ‘Flower of this purple dye, Hit with Cupid’s archery, Sink in apple of his eye’, he meant simply that the love potion would go into Demetrius’ eye.

The first recorded use of the phrase with this meaning is thought to be in a ninth-century English translation of a Latin text by Alfred the Great.

The English language is full of apple idioms. If you climb the 'apples and pears' (Cockney rhyming slang for ‘stairs’) to make your friend ‘an apple-pie bed’ (a practical joke with the sheets folded so that their legs can’t stretch out), you might ‘upset the apple cart’ (disturb the normal state of affairs). But don’t worry, this doesn’t have to be ‘the rotten apple that spoils the barrel’ (a bad influence that ruins everything), you can ‘take a second bite of the apple’ (have another go) and put everything back in ‘apple-pie order’ (make it neat again), even if you also have to do some ‘apple-polishing’ (flattery) along the way.

But English isn’t the only language that uses apple phrases.

Many languages have a version of ‘the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree’, which, from a physics perspective, I’m sure Isaac Newton would agree with! In this phrase, it means that a child is very like their parent.

And many languages use ‘Adam’s apple’ to mean that bit that sticks out in your throat, more so in males than females, a phrase which is thought to refer to that forbidden fruit taken from the Garden of Eden.

Another one that appears in a lot of languages is ‘You can’t compare apples and pears’, which in English tends to be apples and oranges.

And many of us agree that ‘An apple a day keeps the doctor away.’

But there are also some great apple phrases that aren’t so ubiquitous.

Take the Dutch ‘Appeltje-eitje’ (apple-egg) to mean something that’s easy, which also appears in German as ‘Für einen Apfel und ein Ei’ (for an apple and an egg). Or the French ‘Haut comme trois pommes’ (as tall as three apples) to mean short when referring to children.

If you are arguing with someone, you might find ‘Il pomo della discordia’ in Italian, (the apple of discord), which in English might be a bone of contention. This phrase is thought to refer back to the apple that might have started the war between the Trojans and Greeks.

Sometimes you might have to ‘In den sauren Apfel beißen’ (bite the sour apple) - do something you don’t want to because it’s necessary. Perhaps you start to make fun of someone in German - ‘Jemanden veräppeln’ (apple joke) and, if things escalate, in Polish, you might ‘Stłuc kogoś na kwaśne jabłko’ (beat someone into a sour apple) to mean beat to a pulp.

In happier idioms, if you find your kindred spirit in Italian, you might ‘Trovare l'altra metà della mela’ (find the other side of the apple). Similarly in Persian, two love birds might be ‘ مثل سیبی که ازوسط نصف شده ‘ (like an apple cut in half).

From Anne Frank to Cornelis Lely: commemorating 20th century figures and events in stone

Mari Andriessen was a Dutch artist whose sculptures depict people and events of the 20th century in the Netherlands. His statues and memorials, in particular, pay tribute to victims of the Holocaust and the events of World War II.

Mari Andriessen was born in 1897 in Haarlem. His Catholic family were artistic: his mother was a painter, his father was a musician and his brothers went on to become a musician and a composer.

He attended the Haarlem Applied Arts School and then the Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten in Amsterdam, followed by the Academy of Visual Arts in Munich, Germany.

Andriessen began his career as a sculptor in the years preceding World War II, receiving commissions for sculptures in churches and the new train station at Utrecht. During the Nazi Germany occupation of the Netherlands from 1940 to 1945, he was not allowed to receive commissions and was banned from exhibiting.

When the war ended, many municipalities wanted to install memorials. Andriessen's first war memorial was unveiled in Heemstede in 1948. He became a sought-after artist for such monuments, sculpting dozens of statues and memorials.

Let's take a look at six of Andriessen's sculptures.

Man voor het Vuurpeloton(Man in front of the Firing Squad) commemorates the lives of 15 members of the Dutch resistance who were executed at Frederikspark in Haarlem in 1945. The statue is almost two metres high, and was unveiled in 1949. Willem Termetz, a carpenter and friend of Andriessen's, was the model for the statue.

De Dokwerker (The Dock Worker) was installed in Amsterdam in 1952.

It remembers theFebruary Strike of 1941, a powerful act of resistance by Dutch workers against the Nazi occupation during World War II. The memorial immortalises the defiance, resilience and unity of the workers.

Cornelis Lely was a Dutch politician and engineer, who oversaw the construction of theZuiderzee works, which reclaimed land from the sea.

In 1953, a statue of Lely by Andriessen was constructed on the Afsluitdijk, the dam and causeway which encloses the Zuiderzee making it an inland lake rather than open sea.

Not all of Andriessen's sculptures depict real people. His 1962 sculpture Mestreechter Geis pays tribute to character traits of the people of Maastricht, their sense of humour and how they live, drink and sing.

Wilhelmina was Queen of the Netherlands between 1890 and 1948. She reigned throughWorld War I, economic crises in the 1930s  and World War II.

Andriessen produced a number of statues of Wilhelmina. One was displayed in the town hall of Velsen in 1963, while another was erected at a hospital in Amsterdam in 1967 and another in the Wilhelminapark in Utrecht in 1968.

In 1975, Andriessen made a small bronze statue of Anne Frank, the young Jewish girl from Amsterdam whokept a diaryin which she documented life in hiding under Nazi persecution.

Andriessen worked on the statue for a long time, first making it with a seated pose and later standing. He wrote: 'It's actually the first time that, when such a statue goes away,... I would prefer to keep it!'

The statue stands at the Westerkerk (Western Church) in Amsterdam, near the Anne Frank House where Anne and her family hid.

Andriessen worked mostly with stone as the medium for his sculpture. Many of his statues are free-standing, placing their subjects on plinths with little other architectural details. They symbolise the resilience of people in the 20th century who showed great strength in facing adversity. During World War II, Andriessen had been involved with the Dutch resistance, bringing additional meaning to his sculpture.

During his life, Andriessen won many awards and honours. Late in his career, he was often spoken of as 'the national sculptor' of the Netherlands. Mari Andriessen died, aged 82, in 1979.

Starting in Leuvehaven

Transatlantic slave trade

The power of personal stories

Weaving stories of port and city with present-day personal testimony

Destination Port City at the Maritime Museum, Rotterdam, sees visitors board a virtual metro exploring how Rotterdam has been shaped by water, its ports, labour - and the slave trade.

In this exhibition, which opened in December 2022, and will remain on display for the next six years, maritime stories are told in eight stations, each with its own theme. It starts with the story of the birth of Rotterdam in 1270 and ends looking into the future. The stories of port and city are interwoven with personal stories of inhabitants of present-day Rotterdam.

The Maritime Museum is located at Leuvehaven, and the exhibition’s Leuvehaven station is where the story about a colonial past begins.

In the 17th century, large sailing ships were moored in the Leuvehaven, ready to sail to Asia, Africa, the Caribbean or Brazil.

They brought back sugar, coffee, tobacco, cocoa and spices. The goods were stored in the basements of the merchants’ houses. Rich families lived in the most desirable premises. They invested in trade in Asia, where the Dutch East India Company (the VOC) used both diplomacy and violence to acquire the spice trade. They also had plantations in Suriname and on the island of Curaçao, where enslaved people from Africa cultivated the products that were so desired in Europe.

It was not only the rich merchants who profited from the trade: other Rotterdam residents earned nicely from it too.

The ships had to be built and provisioned, and the products that were brought in had to be processed and transported further. The city grew and flourished: you could come across the name ‘Rotterdam’ all over the globe, from the forts called Rotterdam in Macassar (now in Indonesia) and on the island of St. Eustatius, through to plantations bearing the name Rotterdam in Suriname. Wealth for Rotterdam went hand-in-hand with exploitation on the other side of the world.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, ships from Rotterdam set off for the west coast of Africa, loaded with textiles, spirits, gunpowder and guns. Those goods were used to buy enslaved Africans and transport them to the Caribbean and Suriname. 
From the colonies, the ships sailed back to Rotterdam with produce grown on the plantations there by enslaved people. Rotterdam merchants had their ships converted for this trafficking. For the captive Africans, the journey was terrible. On average, one in seven died on the way, their deaths caused by infectious diseases, poor nutrition and suicide. Africans also died in  revolts that broke out on board.

The Scottish officer Stedman is one of the few who recorded the violence against enslaved people in drawings. His book ‘Narrative of a five years' expedition’ is included in the exhibition.

Other archival records show how enslaved people were used as commodities. They lost their own names and were given new names by the plantation owners where they were put to work.

A model of a ship is displayed in front of an image of Brooks' famous depiction to show the degrading way in which enslaved people were stowed in ships. Next to the model is an auction ticket announcing a slave ship and its inventory. The inventory includes 'slave chains and shackles'. The note comes from one of the largest Rotterdam slave traders of the 18th century, Coopstad & Rochussen.

Also on display is one of the two oldest printed maps of Suriname showing tobacco and sugar plantations and the names of the plantation owners.

The images make an impression, but even more impressive is Maureen Mollis' personal story.

Maureen is a descendant of enslaved people, and is leader of the municipal programme for colonial and slavery history of the city of Rotterdam. When visitors enter the exhibition, they first encounter her portrait and further on, hear from Maureen as she recounts the city's colonial past and explains what this past means to her personally.

‘I love the Netherlands – I grew up here. When I cycle across the Erasmus Bridge, You see a black woman. But I’m not just a woman of colour – I’m Maureen, I’m a Rotterdam native, I’m a mother and a partner and proud to work for the city. I’m well aware that the prosperity of Rotterdam was earned at the expense of others, and that’s not a pleasant thought.’ – Maureen Mollis

The exhibition space is split into two sides. One side is dedicated to shipping, colonial trade and the Rotterdam merchants who not only got rich from that trade but also exercised influence in all levels of government in the city. The other side shows the impact on the inhabitants of the colonies, who were exploited, enslaved and transported to the other side of the world.

Interweaving personal stories from Rotterdam’s present inhabitants demonstrates that this turbulent past still resonates throughout life in the city today.

You can find out more about the exhibition on theMaritime Museum Rotterdam’s website.

Did Eve really eat an apple in the Garden of Eden?

Did a poisoned apple kill Snow White?

Did an apple start the Trojan war?

Why did William Tell shoot an apple off his son’s head?

Did an apple fall on Isaac Newton’s head?

Why is New York called the ‘Big Apple’?

Symbolic apples from Adam and Eve to Isaac Newton, via fairy tale and ancient myth

InGenesis chapters 2 and 3, we read that Adam and a woman are put into the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it. God tells them not to eat the fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil or they will die. But a serpent convinces the woman to take a bite. God is angry and as punishment tells the woman that he will ‘make your pains in childbearing very severe’ and that ‘Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you’. He punishes Adam with the promise of ‘painful toil’ and ‘the sweat of your brow’ until ‘to dust you will return’. It is only at this point that Adam names his wife Eve, ‘because she would become the mother of all the living’. They are both banished from the Garden of Eden.

So, where’s the apple? The fruit of the tree of knowledge is often depicted as an apple, but the Hebrew Bible doesn’t actually name it as such. The apple originated in central Asia and so its familiarity may be one reason it became the focus of this story. Another could be that when the Hebrew Bible was translated into Latin, a confusion arose from the similarity between the Latin words for ‘evil’ and ‘apple’ - both versions of the word ‘malus’. In modern Italian, apple is ‘mela’ while evil can be expressed as ‘male’. So, no, we don’t know for sure that Eve really ate an apple in the Garden of Eden.

The idea that apples can represent some kind of a fall persists in the fairy tale of Snow White. When the queen hears the mirror tell her that Snow White is the fairest of them all, the queen makes a poisoned apple - one that looks totally irresistible. She gives herself the appearance of a peasant woman and goes to knock on Snow White’s door. Such is the queen’s deceitfulness that she has made the apple only half-poisoned. When she splits it to share with Snow White, the queen is safe, but Snow White takes a bite and falls down dead.

Well, not quite dead.

After a ‘long, long time’, a prince turns up who persuades the dwarves to give him the coffin with Snow White inside it. Carrying the heavy object, one of the dwarves stumbles, causing the piece of apple to be dislodged from Snow White’s throat. She opens her eyes, sits up, marries the prince and lives happily ever after. So, no, an apple didn’t kill Snow White. But the ending is not so happy for the wicked queen, who, in theoriginal Grimms’ tale, is forced to wear iron shoes that have been heated in burning coals and to ‘dance until she fell down dead.’ Nasty.

Here’s another example of the temptation of the apple, this time from Classical Greek and Roman mythology.

One day, a wedding party is thrown to which all the gods are invited - except Eris, the goddess of strife or disagreement. Annoyed by this, Eris throws a golden apple amongst the party guests. This fruit of temptation is inscribed ‘To the fairest goddess’ but the guests can’t decide who this is. So they let Paris - a human Trojan prince - decide. He has to choose between Juno, Minerva and Venus (also known by their Greek names Hera, Athena and Aphrodite, and who in the Greek version offer him gifts in return for him choosing them). He chooses Venus/Aphrodite, and this is why she is often depicted in art with an apple. According to mythology, this led to the start of the Trojan war. So, yes, it’s possible that an apple did - indirectly - lead to the start of the legendary Trojan war.

With war comes the theme of bravery. You probably know the tale of William Tell shooting an apple off his son’s head, but do you know why? His legend comes from the early 14th century.

The story goes that in 1307, William Tell is arrested, along with his son Walter, for not bowing to a hat on a pole. The hat belongs to Albrecht Gessler, the newly appointed Vogt (a kind of feudal lord) of Altdorf, Switzerland. As punishment, Tell and his son are to be executed - unless Tell can shoot an apple off his son’s head in one attempt. Tell takes up his crossbow and the rest is history.

When that apple split and fell to the ground - and when later in the story Gessler himself fell to the ground from the impact of Tell’s second crossbow bolt - a force was acting upon them. A force that another apple helped scientist Isaac Newton to understand in the late 1660s. It wasn’t the ‘Eureka’ moment it is often described as - and no, the apple didn’t hit Isaac Newton on the head - but it was a significant moment in Newton’s development of the theory of gravity.

Newton saw an apple fall from a tree of the ‘Flower of Kent’ variety - the tree still stands in the grounds of Woolsthorpe Manor in Lincolnshire, UK - and it set off a train of thought. Why did an apple always fall perpendicular (at right angles) to the ground? There must be something in the earth drawing it in. And does it actually fall perpendicularly, or does it fall towards the centre of the earth?

Newton concluded that the apple is drawn towards the earth but that the earth is also drawn towards the apple. Expanding this thought, he realised that there could also be a gravitational relationship between the earth and the moon affecting both their movements and orbits.

We've seen apples symbolising scientific innovation - or put simply, a big idea. Elsewhere, the apple came to mean a big prize - a big apple - especially in horse racing. And this is where we get the name ‘Big Apple’ for New York City - a place of big prizes. It was officially adopted as the city’s nickname in 1971.

From Dracula’s castle to coral reefs, experience world culture with this global webcam tour

In Bram Stoker’s 1897 novelDracula, there is a ‘wild and uncanny place’ - a castle in the Carpathian mountains of Transylvania built ‘on the very edge of a terrible precipice’.

Finding himself a prisoner in this castle, one of the book’s narrators, Jonathan Harker, describes ‘broken battlements’ showing ‘a jagged line against the moonlit sky’ and ‘tall black windows’ from which ‘came no ray of light’.

He writes in his journal that:

To the west was a great valley, and then, rising far away, great jagged mountain fastnesses, rising peak on peak, the sheer rock studded with mountain ash and thorn, whose roots clung in cracks and crevices and crannies of the stone.

Bram Stoker never visitedRomaniabut the detailed descriptions of Dracula’s Castle have given rise to the opinion that it must be based on a real castle -Castelul Bran. It is the only castle in Romania that matches Stoker’s description.

Is it foreboding and wild? Or majestic and serene? That depends on your viewpoint, and perhaps on the weather. Take a look at Castelul Bran’s webcam and see how it makes you feel today.

There are many reasons to love coral. It acts as a buffer to protect shorelines from the worst of the ocean’s attacks. It is home to incredible and valuable ecosystems with mind-blowing levels of biodiversity which benefit local communities by driving tourism. And it even has medicinal qualities - scientists are looking to coral reef animals and plants for cures to human diseases like cancer.

But human activity is also destroying reefs through pollution and climate change, fishing and harvesting of coral for building materials. It takes hundreds of thousands of years for a single coral larvae to turn into the kind of structure we see today in coral barrier reefs and atolls. Yet more than half of our coral reefs have been lost since the 1950s.

With this webcam, you can meet Karla, the Blacktip Reef Shark as she swims aroundGermany’s largest living coral reef at the State Museum of Natural History in Karlsruhe. Sometimes, you can also catch divers in the tank, making it clean and safe for its inhabitants.

Set on a clifftop 27 metres above the sea, the dramatic open air Minack Theatre is the result of the vision and hard work of Rowena Cade who built it almost single-handedly in the 1930s. Minack means ‘a rocky place’ and Rowena bought this rocky place for £100 in the early 1920s and built her home, Minack House, there.

After offering the use of her garden for an open air performance of Shakespeare’sThe Tempest, Rowena had to create a stage area and somewhere for the audience to sit. And so she started digging and cutting rocks to create terraces, and later, carving complex designs into wet concrete. Now, the theatre stages over 200 performances a year. Its webcam provides the exact same view as the photograph we've featured here!

Japanese garden design is based on Buddhist, Shinto and Taoist philosophies inspiring calm and peaceful contemplation. TheAdachi Museum of Art, Yasugi, Japan, is home to gardens designed as a ‘living Japanese painting’ in line with the belief of the museum’s founder, Adachi Zenko, that ‘the garden is also a picture’.

Watch the webcam from the Champaign Aviation Museum in Ohio, USA, and you can step inside a hangar and see a Boeing B-17G ‘Flying Fortress’ being restored. This type of aircraft was developed as a bomber for the United States Army Air Corps and dates from the 1930s. It dropped more bombs than any other type of aircraft in World War II.

TheB-17G at the Champaign Aviation Museum, nicknamed ‘Champaign Lady’, was manufactured in 1945 and is being rebuilt using parts from other airframes. When replacement parts are not available, a team of volunteers makes them using original drawings as reference.

If you’re in Europe, check this one in the afternoon or evening, Ohio is six hours behind Central European Time.

The Vitra Design Museum is in Weil am Rhein in Germany, just across the border from Basel, Switzerland. It was founded in 1989 to display a private furniture collection.

Over time, it has produced small exclusive exhibitions, internationally acclaimed exhibitions and travelling exhibitions, as well as establishing an independent publishing house and its own product lines. Amongst its 7,000 items of furniture is a collection of trulyiconic chairs.

The buildings at the Vitra Design Museum are definitely worth a look in their own right. Since the 1980s, the Vitra company has erected buildings with structures by international architects such as Herzog & de Meuron, Zaha Hadid, Tadao Ando, Frank Gehry, Nicholas Grimshaw, SANAA, Álvaro Siza and others.

The webcam gives a view over the South entrance of the Vitra Campus. Inside the buildings you see in the webcam are amazing collections of design objects (in the Schaudepot designed by Herzog & de Meuron) and sharp-edged, high-ceilinged exhibition spaces (in the Fire Station designed by Zaha Hadid).

Do you know your elk from your moose or wapiti?

The North American elk (Cervus candensis) - also known as wapiti - is one of the largest members of the deer family. They can grow to stand 1.5m tall at the shoulder and weigh up to 540 kg. But the Eurasian elk (Alces alces) - also known as moose - is bigger. The record breaker was a moose killed in Yukon in 1897, with a shoulder height of 2.3m and weight of 366 kg.

At the National Museum of Wildlife Art in Wyoming, USA, which houses more than 5,000 artworks of wild animals around the world, you can look for elk (wapiti) as well as coyotes, hawks, foxes and even wolves with its webcam that overlooks the National Elk Refuge.

The Mevlevi Sema ceremony as intangible heritage

Mevlevi music today

Mevlevi music found its way to Europe through a combination of historical events, cultural exchange and the global fascination with Sufism and mysticism

Mevlevi music is a form of music which accompanies the Whirling Dance ceremony of the Mevlevi Dervishes, a school of the Sufism branch of Islam.

Originating more than 700 years ago, Mevlevi music has gradually become more known across Europe due to historical events and cultural exchange. In this blog, Özgür Önal looks at how Mevlevi music found its way to Europe.

Sufi mysticMevlana Celaleddin Rumiinspired and planted the seeds of the Mevlevi order which was established after him in Konya, Turkey in the 13th century. The Mevlevi Order emphasises the pursuit of divine love, spiritual transformation through a disciplined and ritualistic approach to Sufism.

The Mevlevi Order cherishes music in their rituals. Whirling dervish rituals, which is the fundamental ritual of this order, may be described as a form of worship. Music is one of the main elements of the ritual.

The Ottoman Empire had a significant presence in the European continent for several centuries.

As a result of the Ottoman Empire's diplomatic relations and cultural exchanges, elements of Turkish and Ottoman culture, including Mevlevi traditions, began to leave their own legacy in Europe.

Many Mevlevi Lodges were founded in Balkan cities during the Ottoman era. The most important are in İsa Bey (Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina), Filibe (Plovdiv, Bulgaria), Peçoy (Pécs, Hungary), Gözleve (Yevpatoria, Ukraine), Üsküp (Skopje, Macedonia), Atina (Athens, Greece) and Hanya (Crete, Greece).

The İsa Bey Zâviyesi in Sarajevo, one of the first Mevlevi lodges in Europe, was established in the 13th century.

The lodge was built in 1462 or 1463 by Isa Bey Ishaković and was one of the first Islamic places of worship in Sarajevo. The lodge was destroyed and rebuilt several times in different periods.

The lodge restoration was financed by donations from the Municipality of Selçuklu in Konya (Turkey) and the lodge was officially reopened in the spring of 2013.

Many important musicians were trained in Mevlevi lodge education as part of the Mevlevi tradition. Ismail Dede Efendi was one of those remarkable Mevlevi musicians.

Ismail Dede Efendi was a prominent Turkish composer and musician known for his contributions to Turkish classical music during the Ottoman Empire.

He composed more than 500 masterpieces in different forms as well as Mevlevi ritual music. Ismail Dede Efendi's compositions continue to be celebrated and performed today, making him a significant figure in the history of Turkish classical music.

Ismail Dede Efendi composed Gülnihal as a response to the influence of Western music and the changing musical landscape in the Ottoman Empire during the 19th century. This composition is a testament to his desire to express how rich and inclusive Turkish music is, marking it as the first waltz in Turkish music.

Ismail Dede Efendi composed Ferahfeza Ayin using all the subtleties and possibilities of musical tradition. It is considered as a symbol of modernisation in a  period of Turkish music where westernisation began to influence musical norms.

Austrian composer, organist and priest Maximilian Stadler is an important figure who bridges Mevlevi music with European tradition in the 1820s.

In 1821, Stadler was introduced to Mevlevi music by Herr von Hussard, the translator at the German embassy in Istanbul.

During his years in Istanbul, Hussard had translated Mevlana Celaleddin Rumi's Mesnevi into German. He listened to and watched many Mevlevi rituals, and memorised the melodies of some rituals. Stadler transcribed these melodies of 7 Mevlevi Ayins and authored the bookOriginal Chöre Der Derwische Mewlewi in Arabischer, Persischer ve Türkischer Sprache. This book was published asPietro Mechetti qui Carloedition in 1825.

Mevlevi music is an integral part of the Mevlevi Sema ceremony, a religious ritual performed by dervishes.

The ceremony involves music, rhythm and belief, and aims to act as a bridge between God and humankind through the practice of 'sema'. In 2005, UNESCO declared theMevlevi sema ceremonya Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.

Those recognitions have helped to increase the visibility of Mevlevi music and the Mevlevi Order around the world. The first Mevlevi lodge in Germany was founded in 1990. Today there are two different Mevlevi groups, which are located in Nurnberg and Trebbus.

In Europe today, Mevlevi music has emerged with both contemporary interpretations and original representations, highlighting its relevance and influence in the modern era.

Modern-day cultural exchanges, international festivals, and academic research have further promoted Mevlevi music in Europe. Musicians and scholars from both Turkey and Europe have collaborated to preserve and share this rich musical tradition.

Today, Mevlevi music and the Sema ceremony can be experienced in various European cities, where they continue to captivate audiences with their spiritual depth and artistic beauty. The journey of Mevlevi music to Europe underscores the power of cultural exchange and the universal appeal of mysticism and music.

Cultural connections between the UK and Europe

Cultural cooperation between nations and cultures comes in many forms - from informal collaborations between artists to multi-partner cultural and digitalprojects like Europeana is involved with.

Involving whole towns and cities, one of the largest forms of cultural cooperation may be town twinning. There are many twinned towns and cities (sometimes also called sister cities) across Europe.

Town or city twinning involves communities in different countries becoming connected, finding similarities in their histories, demographics, societal or cultural traditions. Some town twinning projects are formally agreed, lasting many years with comprehensive programmes of work. Some can be more informal.

Let's explore these connections. To do so, we've exploredArtUK, the online home for every public art collection in the United Kingdom. Artworks of  town or cities from each of the British nations on their website will be matched with those from Europeana, depicting their European twin city.

Exeter is the county town of Devon in the southwest of England.

Its history dates back to Roman times, with a towering cathedral founded in the 11th century. The cathedral is built on the edge of a ridge which forms the backbone of the city, meaning that the cathedral can be seen from a long distance.

The cathedral interior has been captured in this painting from 1797 by artist Thomas Girtin. It is a watercolour, typical of Girtin's style using warm browns and slate greys to capture landscapes and architecture. The painting is now part of the collections of theRoyal Albert Memorial Museum & Art Galleryin Exeter.

Exeter is twinned with Rennes inFrance, another city with a large cathedral.

The Cathédrale Saint-Pierre de Rennes has been a historic monument since 1906, but its history stretches back until at least the 6th century. The existing building was built in stages, dating between the 1540s and early 1700s.

This building has inspired a pair of photographer brothers known as Charlet. The brothers - Étienne and Louis-Antonin Neurdein - opened a photography studio inParisin 1863. Étienne ran the photo studio and specialised in portrait photography, while Louis-Antonin travelled and photographed landscapes, buildings and monuments.

Glasgow, the largest city inScotland, has been twinned with Turin in Italy since 2003.

The city of Glasgow expanded greatly from the 18th century onwards, its growth fueled by industrial development. The city centre is based on a grid system of streets - one of which, Renfield Street, is portrayed here.

Renfield Street has been a location for offices and shops, as well as cinemas and theatres. This oil painting by Patrick S. Dunn dates from 1887, and shows the street busy with transport and pedestrians.

Turin, in the Piedmont province inItaly, also saw a rapid growth due to industrialisation. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the automobile industry was found in the city, with FIAT and Lancia factories.

Much of the city's centre had already been laid out previously, between the 16th and 18th centuries. The city's baroque architecture includes castles, gardens, palazzi and public squares.

One of the main city squares in Turin, Piazza San Carlo, is depicted in this artwork by Francesco Gamba, an artist from Turin who specialised in landscape painting.

The name Piazza San Carlo is perhaps triply appropriate: the Church of San Carlo Borromeo is situated on the edge of the square (along with the Church of Santa Cristina), the square's equestrian statue was designed by Carlo Marochetti and the surrounding porticos were designed by Carlo di Castellamonte.

Aberystwyth is a town inWales, twinned with Arklow, a town in County Wicklow inIreland. Both places face each other across the Irish Sea. Aberystwyth sits on Cardigan Bay, while Arklow is situated at the mouth of the River Avoca where it meets Arklow Bay.

Both places are defined by their locations at the mouths of rivers. The word Aberystwyth means 'the mouth of the Ystwyth', a river which flows from the Cambrian mountains into Cardigan Bay. The Irish name for Arklow isAn tInbhear Mór, meaning 'the great estuary' for the Avoca river.

This geography has been captured in these paintings.

This oil paintingAberystwyth from Constitution Hillis by William Ward Gill, and dates from 1861.

This painting depicts green fields and landscapes near Aberystwyth. It was painted by Belgian artist Valerius de Saedeleer between 1914 and 1918, when de Saedeleer and his family lived in Wales as refugees fromWorld War I.

This watercolour from 1861 depicts workers on the shore of Arklow Bay. It was painted by Irish artist George Victor Du Noyer, who was often commissioned to realistically depict Irish locations.

This coloured aquatint from 1800 is by landscape painter Thomas Walmsley, and depicts the point where two rivers meet to create the Avoca River which flows on to Arklow.

Bangor, a city in County Down in Northern Ireland, is twinned with Bregenz, a city inAustria. Both towns have important tourism industries, in part due to their location near large bodies of water.

Bangor is located on the east coast of Northern Ireland, on the south shore of Belfast Lough. This part of the Lough is known as Ballyholme Bay.

During the 19th century, Bangor's tourism industry developed, as the city became a place to spend time by the sea. Many of the city's seafront buildings were built during this time.

These two oil paintings are by artist Thomas Hanna. They show buildings along two streets in Bangor, the Parade and Shore Street.

Bregenz, a city in the Vorarlberg region of Austria, is located on the shores of Lake Constance (Bodensee).

With the Alps reaching nearby, Bregenz and its surrounding region are an area of great natural beauty. This has led to the development of a strong tourism industry, focusing on outdoor sports and activities such as boating, swimming, hiking and cycling.

Though very different in style, the view of Bangor's building is echoed in this 17th century engraving which shows the buildings of Bregenz along the shores of Bodensee. It is one of several hundred views and maps of cities, published together asTheatrum Urbiumby engraver Matthäus Merian the Elder.

This view of Bregenz and Bodensee dates from the late 18th or early 19th century. It is a watercolour by artist Karl Ludwig Friedrich Viehbeck and is in the collections of theAlbertina Museumin Vienna.

The earthquake was one of Europe's worst natural disasters

In the morning of 1 November 1755, an earthquake struck Lisbon, the capital city of Portugal, which flattened the city and claimed many thousands of lives.

The earthquake had an estimated magnitude of 8.5 on the Richter scale. It began at around 9:40 in the morning and lasted for several minutes.

The earthquake caused widespread destruction throughout Lisbon, with most of the city's buildings being completely destroyed. Many people were killed in the initial earthquake, while others were trapped in the rubble of their collapsed homes.

The earthquake also triggered a massive tsunami that hit the city's harbour, causing further destruction and loss of life.

November 1 was All Saints' Day, with candles lit in homes and churches all around the city. The earthquake caused these to be knocked over, which led to fires breaking out throughout the city.

As many as 70,000 people - around a quarter of Lisbon's population - died in the earthquake and its aftermath.

The earthquake's violence demolished the city's large public buildings. Almost every important church in the city had been destroyed. The city was left in ruins, and it took many years for it to fully recover from the disaster.

The engravings here reveal the damage to some of Lisbon's historical buildings. These engravings were made in 1757 by Jacques Philippe Le Bas, who was head of Paris's largest engraving workshop in the 18th century.

Effects of the earthquake and tsunami were felt throughout Portugal and in parts of Spain and Morocco. Damage was even reported as far away as Algeria and Ireland, with some waves from the tsunami felt in the Caribbean and Brazil.

King  Joseph I and Portugal's prime minister, the Marquis of Pombal, immediately launched efforts to rebuild the city. It took nearly a year to clear the city of debris.

In keeping with urban planning of the time, the authorities wanted the new city to be perfectly ordered. They commissioned large squares, wide avenues and geometrically planned streets.

The 1755 Lisbon earthquake was one of Europe's worst natural disasters which ultimately shaped the city of Lisbon as we know it today.

The Three Musketeers

The Man in the Iron Mask

The Count of Monte Cristo

The influence of The Three Musketeers, The Man in the Iron Mask and The Count of Monte Cristo on film, theatre and music

Alexandre Dumas is one of the most prolific and widely known French authors: his works span many different genres and have been translated into numerous languages. Their influence in today’s society and culture is undeniable. This blog will look at how Dumas's literary works have been adapted into film, theatre and other performing arts.

Alexandre Dumas was born in Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti), the son of a French nobleman in the military and Marie-Cessette Dumas, a Black African enslaved woman. Her provenance and her ancestors are still uncertain - in the 20th century, it was hypothesised that she could have been of Yoruba or Dahomeyan origins.

Despite his success as a writer, throughout his life, Dumas faced discrimination and racism due to his ancestry. This influenced some of his work: the short novelGeorgesis one of the rare works by Dumas concerning matters of enslavement, racism, abolitionism and colonisation as its central theme. Many of these also appear inThe Count of Monte Cristo.

The Three Musketeersis probably the most famous and influential work by Dumas. Leadership, loyalty, friendship, romance, class and power are some of the many topics featured in the novel. Since its release in 1844, it has become an iconic piece of literature that has inspired many people for centuries.

The brave and dynamic character D’artagnan has been interpreted by many actors in movies, theatre plays and more.

There have been many adaptations ofThe Three Musketeerssince its first film version in 1909.I tre moschettieriby Mario Caserini was an Italian production, with many other film adaptations directed by Italians. For instance,D’Artagnan contro i tre moschettieriin 1964 was directed by Fulvio Tului and starred Fernando Lamas.

Versions are not limited to cinema and theatre: singer-songwriter Citizen Cope has published a song titledD’Artagnan’s Theme, with an obvious reference to the character in the title.

The Vicomte of Bragelonne: Ten Years Lateris the third and last novel concerning the character of D’Artagnan. Critic R. L. Stevenson argues that 'in the character of D'Artagnan... we must look for the spirit of morality, which is one of the main joys of its perusal, and sets it high above more popular rivals'. The novel was published between 1848 and 1850.

Inspired by an unknown convict of four different prisons in France during the later 12th century, the story ofThe Man in the Iron Maskis another iconic piece of literature by Dumas that has been represented in many performances.

Philosopher Voltaire wrote that the prisoner in the iron mask might have actually been the illegitimate child of Anne of Austria and Cardinal Mazarin and therefore Luigi XIV’s half-brother. The whole novel is based on this supposition.

The story has been adapted in many movies in the 20th century. The first poster dates back to 1895 demonstrates how influential the novel has been throughout the decades, with a Hollywood production in the 1920s.

The Count of Monte Cristois one of Dumas's few works that deals with themes like discrimination and racism.

In the 19th century, European economy and life depended on global trade, leading people with different backgrounds to mix their cultures and to come in contact with each other. The characters’ relationships with the East, and with other foreign places like Monte Cristo, demonstrate that 'otherness' was a central part of European life and society, a matter that Dumas was affected by and faced directly in his life because of his heritage.

The Count of Monte Cristohas been adapted into many films, television shows and even a musical, highlighting its importance in popular culture as well as literature in Europe – not just France.

Alexandre Dumas' works continue to inspire writers and artists to this day, and his influence on literature and popular culture is a testament to his lasting legacy, inspiring individuals of all backgrounds and reminding us of the importance of diversity and inclusion not just in literature, but in our society as a whole.

Origins

Club career

International career

First black footballer to play for the Italian national team

Miguel Montuori was a footballer in the Italian Serie A league during the 1950s and early 1960s. He was the first black footballer to play for the Italian national football team.

Montuori was born in Rosario, a city in Argentina, in 1932. His father was from Naples, while his mother was of Afro-Argentinian heritage.

His professional football career began in Chile, where he played for Universidad Católica in Santiago with whom he won the 1954 Chilean championship. In 1955, he was scouted to join Italian team ACF Fiorentina in Florence.

Montuori played with Fiorentina for 6 years, making 162 Serie A appearances. He was a forward or attacking midfielder, and scored 72 goals.

In his first season, Fiorentina won the Italian league title, and were the runner-up for years in a row. They reached the final of the Coppa Italia tournament four times between 1958 and 1961, winning the cup in 1961.

He was also part of the team which won the 1960–61 European Cup Winners' Cup, and were the runners-up in the European Cup in 1956-57.

Although born in Argentina, Montuori played for the Italy national team internationally. He made his debut against France in 1956; his final appearance was against Switzerland in 1960.

He was the first black footballer to play forItaly. In 1959, he was the first footballer who had not been born in Italy to captain the team.

Aged just 28, Montuori's playing career ended prematurely. In 1961, during a friendly match against Perugia, his face was struck by a ball which caused his retina to detach. With his vision blurred, he retired from professionalfootball.

After retiring, he worked as a coach in Italian and Chilean teams. Miguel Montuori passed away in 1998, aged 65.

Optical boxes and optical views

Discovery of the world through optical views

The first common European image market

The fascination for discovering the world through optical views endures over time

...our beloved cinema is part of a long process, emerging out of the experience of previous shows and technologies. Someday it will disappear as well to give way to a new visual spectacle, fruit of some further technological advancement, which will nevertheless continue to retain the original magic and essence that has remained unchanged since the very beginning: the capacity to move us emotionally through images.

Jordi Pons Busquet – Image Makers. From Shadow Theater to Cinema

More than two centuries ago, European citizens flocked to markets and fairs to revel in the exciting scenes shown to them through 'magical' optical views.

Through the lenses of optical boxes, a travelling visual spectacle, the spectators were able to observe images of distant and unknown scenes that these 'views' offered.

The optical box was a fair attraction that, during the 18th and early 19th centuries, allowed European citizens to see the world through a pinhole.

At a time when travelling was slow and cumbersome, not many people travelled far and wide. Additionally, neither photography nor illustrated press had been invented yet, so images were scarce. Optical boxes satisfied many people's need for knowledge of the world.

This show, touring through towns and cities, showed images with a sense of reality and visual effects unmatched in that age. The optical views were engravings or sketches that were viewed inside an optical box, bringing the world closer to many people throughout Europe.

Optical view boxes were boxes with one or more holes with lenses, through which a semi-3D image was observed with sharpness and a sense of depth; visual effects were also often added by playing with light. Often, several layers of cut-out drawings and sketches were layered on top of each other to create an effect of depth and movement.

The same box used to view these optical views in could often also be transformed into a camera obscura. By removing the sketches or drawings from the inside of the box and letting light fall through the optical viewfinder, the outside world would be projected on the bottom of the box, allowing people to trace, draw and sketch the outside world from inside the box.

The optical views allowed viewers to travel through Europe, as they showed famous cities of the time (Vienna, Paris, Rome, London), as well as inaccessible, exotic or ancient places. They also connected citizens with current issues and catastrophes or offered an approach to mythological, theatrical and religious topics.

The field of view was limited by the hole in the lens, and thanks to the details of the engraving and the sharp perspective, viewers had an immersive effect that was new to that time.

Optical views spread throughout Europe unbothered by country borders or language changes.

They contributed to something akin to a 'first common European image market', where a large number of Europeans shared the same cultural memory. Optical views worked as a universal visual media of communication at a time when access to images, knowledge and culture was a far cry from what we live in today.

Now, at the end of the first quarter of the 21st century, we continue to innovate in ways of looking at and discovering the world. Projects likeEUreka3Dallow us to access our high-quality 3D digitised heritage and make it available to cultural heritage professionals, researchers, educators and citizens.

This blog is part of theEUreka3D project, which aims to build the capacity of small cultural heritage institutions in digital transformation, particularly on issues related to 3D digitisation.

What were Folke Zettervall’s railway stations?

What were Folke Zettervall's architectural influences?

Folke Zettervall's legacy

Head architect of Swedish State Railways (Statens Järnvägar) who designed 250 train stations

In Sweden, one architect is responsible for more than 250 railway station buildings. Folke Zettervall was the chief architect of the Swedish State Railways in the early part of the 20th century.

When we pass through railway stations in a rush to catch our trains, we don't often think about the architects who designed the station. Despite being mostly functional, many train stations are beautiful buildings, which reflect art and architectural movements.

Born in 1862, Zettervall was educated in his home-town Lund, as well as Uppsala and Copenhagen. He graduated from the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 1888.

Zettervall initially worked for a Swedish government agency which administered state buildings. In 1890, he was recruited to work in the architectural office of the Swedish national railway system. By 1898, he was appointed the railway's chief architect, a role he held until 1931.

Over the course of his career, Zettervall designed around 260 different railway station buildings acrossSweden, including those in Gällivare, Jönköping and Sundsvall.

He even designed the station at Stångby, just outside his home town of Lund. It was opened in 1901.

He designed the railway station in Kiruna, a mining town inside the Arctic Circle. The brick building was completed in 1915. However, the building was demolished in 2017 as part of Kiruna's plans to move their town to accommodate the mining industry.

The culmination of Zettervall's career came in the 1920s, when he re-designed and extended Sweden's three largest railway stations: the central stations in Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö.

Zettervall's buildings were primarily built from brick and wood. He was influenced by the work of American architect Henry Hobson Richardson, who revived elements from 11th and 12th century Romanesque architecture from southern Europe.

Finnish architect Eliel Saarinenwas similarly influenced by Richardson.

As well as railway stations, Zettervall also designed offices and residences for railway employees. Outside the railways, he designed buildings such as courthouses, hotels, and churches.

Folke Zettervall married twice. He married his first wife, Emma, in 1895. Tragically, she died a few months after the wedding. He later married Ellen Bergman, in 1900. They were married until her death in 1944.

Folke Zettervall lived until 1955, leaving a legacy of hundreds of railway stations across Sweden, allowing people to travel and connect. That’s not all. In their wills, both Ellen and Folke left money to establish a foundation to support architecture students and the future of architecture.

Josephine Baker, the legendary entertainer, was not only celebrated for her remarkable talent and groundbreaking contributions to the world of entertainment but also for her distinctive sense of style that left an indelible mark on the world of fashion.

Born in 1906 in St. Louis, Missouri, Baker's journey from a humble background to international stardom was accompanied by a transformative relationship with fashion.

Baker's early years in showbiz saw her donning the flapper fashion of the Roaring Twenties. Her iconic bobbed hair, sleek evening gowns, and ornate headbands became symbolic of the era's liberated spirit.

But it was her daring performances at the Folies Bergère in Paris that truly catapulted her into the limelight.

Baker's off-stage style was equally influential. She embraced androgynous fashion, often wearing tailored suits, bow ties, and cropped hairstyles. Her fondness for menswear-inspired clothing challenged traditional gender norms.

Her striking style was immortalised by many photographers, who contributed to turning her into an enduring fashion icon.

Man Ray was one of the first to capture Baker's image as the face of the avant-garde. George Hoyningen-Huene photographed her at her most glamorous and sophisticated.

Martin Munkácsi captured Josephine Baker in a more dynamic and candid light, showcasing her vivacious energy and the excitement necessary for her stage performances.

Carl Van Vechten, known for his portraits of influential figures of the Harlem Renaissance, highlighted her beauty and unique sense of style while also reflecting the cultural and social significance of her work.

These images capturing the multifarious soul of Josephine Baker have inspired numerous fashion designers over the years.

Designers such as Jean Paul Gaultier and Marc Jacobs often spoke of Baker as the inspiring force behind their bold designs. The famous shoe designer Christian Louboutin even designed a pair of shoes inspired by her iconic banana skirt, paying homage to her groundbreaking fashion choices.

African American fashion designer Patrick Kelly gained recognition in the 1980s in the Parisian fashion scene. He celebrated black culture and cited Josephine Baker as a muse for many of his collections. Kelly was known for his playful and bold designs, often featuring humorous motifs and vibrant colours.

In a similar vein, creative director of Balmain Olivier Rousteing has spoken about his admiration for Josephine Baker's groundbreaking efforts in promoting racial diversity and has incorporated elements of her style into Balmain's collections.

Not only designers, but also models have drawn inspiration from Baker’s distinctive look and pioneering spirit.

Somali-born supermodel Iman, a trailblazer for models of colour in the fashion industry, had an impact on diversity in modelling that resonates with Baker's groundbreaking efforts to challenge racial norms.

Similarly, Grace Jones’ androgynous style and avant-garde fashion choices reflect elements of Josephine Baker's boundary-pushing approach to style and beauty.

Naomi Campbell has acknowledged Josephine Baker as one of her inspirations, as did Tyra Banks: Banks has cited Baker's confidence and ability to break barriers as a source of inspiration for her career and her mission to empower aspiring models and promote diversity on and off the catwalk.

Josephine Baker's influence on fashion extended far beyond her lifetime.

Her fearless approach to style, her celebration of diversity, and her willingness to challenge societal norms continue to resonate with contemporary fashion icons and designers. Her legacy serves as a reminder that fashion is not just about clothing - it's a powerful tool for self-expression, empowerment, and social change.

Reflections on a year honouring those who came from the Caribbean to Britain

The ship HMTEmpire Windrusharrived at Tilbury Docks in Essex on 22 June 1948, bringing more than 800 passengers from the Caribbean. It is a key symbolic moment which can be seen as the beginning of the modern multi-ethnic society in Britain today.

1n 2023, we marked the 75th anniversary of this historic moment.

Those who came from the Caribbean to the UK between 1948 and 1971 became known as the Windrush Generation, after the famous ship.

The vessel itself has an interesting history: before it came under British control, theWindrush(then known as theMonte Rosa) was used by the Nazis, initially as a cruise-ship but later to transport troops during the German invasion of Norway.

Due to the presence of British Pathé journalists at the docking of the Empire Windrush, it became the most famous of ships carrying passengers from the Caribbean to Britain.

It was not the only ship, however, nor even the first. TheOrmondedocked in Liverpool on 31 March 1947 carrying 241 passengers. Later that year, on 21 December 1947, theAlmanzoradocked in Southampton carrying 200 more.

22 June is Windrush Day, a moment to honour the contribution of migrants to Britain, with a focus on those who came from the Caribbean.

The day was only officially adopted by the UK Government in 2019, in the aftermath of the so-called ‘Windrush scandal’ and a campaign spearheaded by Patrick Vernon whowrote about the idea back in 2010.

However, Windrush commemoration activity had been taking place long before official recognition came, organised by the likes of Arthur Torrington, co-founder of theWindrush Foundation, and Windrush passenger Sam King MBE. So it should be remembered that the origins of Windrush Day came from the Windrush Generation and their descendants, not the government.

As 2023 marked the 75th anniversary of the arrival of the Windrush, efforts were made to help ensure this important moment in Britain’s history was celebrated throughout the country.

Windrush campaigner Patrick Vernon, alongside British Future, a think-tank and charity working on race and identity, convened theWindrush 75 Network, bringing together almost 500 organisations and individuals committed to marking the occasion.

The network sought to amplify the voices of those working at grassroots and national level to raise awareness of the activity taking place. Network members included those from the Windrush community, event organisers, arts and culture practitioners, faith leaders, teachers and more.

A huge variety of events have taken place across the UK this year, especially on Windrush Day, in our cities, towns and even villages, with theWindrush 75 Network events pagedisplaying more than 200 listings.

Alongside scores of local community events a number of prestigious, world renowned venues looked to celebrate this historic moment.

They included DJTrevor Nelson’s Windrush 75 Concertat the Royal Albert Hall, a Service of Thanksgiving at Southwark Cathedral, a reception at the Houses of Parliament and an event at Buckingham Palace to unveilten portraits of pioneering members of the Windrush Generation, commissioned by King Charles III.

One of the portraits from King Charles’ commissioned collection was of Alford Gardner, one of the last surviving Windrush passengers. I was honoured to meet Alford earlier this year at the launch event for photographer Jim Grover’s excellent exhibition,Windrush: A Voyage through the Generations.

Europeana’s Windrush collection includes an interview with Alford, where he discusses travelling on the Windrush and his experiences of racial prejudice in England.

Interviews like this demonstrate the resonance and importance of capturing the experiences of the Windrush Generation, while we still can.

This should be one of the key legacies of the Windrush 75 commemorations. While there are a number of oral history projects organised by various stakeholders, these precious stories are spread across a number of archives and databases. Bringing them together, while also capturing new oral testimonies, should be a priority for those of us working on Windrush commemoration.

Looking beyond this anniversary year, the network will support sustained efforts in education, culture and beyond to capture, record and memorialise the lived experiences of the Windrush Generation itself and to ensure these resonate for future generations.

While much of the Windrush commemoration was about celebrating this pioneering generation, Windrush 75 Network Convenor Patrick Vernon has often referred to Windrush Day as being ‘bittersweet’.

'Bitter' due to the ongoing injustices faced by this generation, notably with the continued issues surrounding the ‘Windrush scandal’. But ‘sweet’ as it is an opportunity to acknowledge and celebrate the Windrush Generation’s huge contribution to Britain.

As we come to the end of the 75th anniversary year, we should reflect on the progress that has been made over the last 75 years, while also looking to the future and considering the work that still needs to be done. We want to ensure that Windrush 75 has a powerful legacy beyond 2023.

Our network will continue to bring people together to honour this generation by marking the Windrush anniversary every year and using this moment to deepen the public conversation about the past, present and future of race in Britain.

But we also want to look further into the future at a more ambitious goal: where do we want our society to be, on issues of race, inclusion and equity, by the time we mark the Windrush centenary in 2048? And what are the conversations and agendas we can start to implement today to help us get there?

Realising this centenary vision – of a fair and equal Britain – would be a fitting legacy and one that the Windrush Generation would have been proud to see.

George Bridgetower was a Black violinist and composer who lived in the 18th century, an important time during the development of Western Classical music.

George was born in 1778 in Poland to a Polish-German mother and an Afro-Caribbean father. They soon moved to England, where the Bridgetower family mingled with the English high class. By the age of 10, George was already performing on stage as a violinist in venues such as theDrury Lane Theatre, in front of royalty and nobility.

George's talent and his parents' good connections led to the British Prince Regent, who would later become King George IV, taking George under his wing. George received the best violin education from renowned musicians at that time such asFrançois Barthélémon,Ivan Mane JarnovićandThomas Attwood. Attwood was himself a pupil of Mozart.

Under their tutelage and guidance, George Bridgetower played in the King's orchestra in Brighton and London. Even Thomas Jefferson, one of the founding fathers of the United States, heard George Bridgetower play, at a concert in Paris in 1789.

During a visit to Vienna in 1803, George Bridgetower's path would cross withLudwig van Beethoven. Beethoven was at the height of his creative powers, and the two musicians struck up an unlikely but profound friendship.

Beethoven's admiration for George's virtuosity led to him dedicating his Violin Sonata No. 9 in A minor (Op.47) to Bridgetower. They premiered the piece together in Vienna in 1803, with Beethoven on piano and Bridgetower on Violin. Bridgetower purportedly had to sightread some of the piece over Beethoven's shoulder while they were playing it

Something happened shortly after this premiere that led to a falling out between Beethoven and Bridgetower. Most accounts mention that Bridgetower had said something about a woman, or had insulted a woman, who turned out to be a close friend of Beethoven. Beethoven purportedly broke all ties with Bridgetower and changed his dedication of Sonata N°9 to Rudolphe Kreutzer instead. Kreutzer never ended up playing what is now unequivocally known as 'the Kreutzer Sonata'.

Listen to theKreutzer Sonataperformed by Susanne Lautenbacher, 1959.Bibliothèque nationale de France,public domain

Bridgetower was a composer of music as well. Sadly, most of his work is lost, as has happened with many compositions of that time. Only the most famous and prestigious compositions of the Age of Western Classical Music have survived until this day. A few compositions of Bridgetower do survive, includingDiatonica armonica for pianoforteand the lovelyHenry: A Ballad.

Were it not for his falling out with Beethoven, or the loss of many of his compositions, George Bridgetower might have been a much more celebrated and famous Classical composer today.

We often see European Classical music as being dominated by white men, but when we look deeper it becomes clear that this music genre has been influenced by women such asHildegard of BingenandClara Schumann, and Black people such asChevalier de Saint Georgesand, indeed, George Bridgetower.

Artist from Gotland who lived in Switzerland and Paris

Anna Gardell-Ericson was a Swedish artist whose paintings and watercolours depict the beauty of Swedish nature and landscapes.

Born in Visby on the island of Gotland in 1853, her talent was seen in her early years. Aged sixteen, she went to Switzerland to study music but soon she switched to art.

Later, she studied at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts in Stockholm. In 1879, she moved to Paris to continue her studies.

There, she was able to study French landscape painting, and honed her craft by making copies of artworks by the influential landscape artist Camille Corot, among others.

Anna participated in exhibitions and salons, earning a contract to supply watercolours to art dealers Goupil & Cie.

In 1882, Anna Gardell married Johan Ericson, a Swedish landscape painter. They lived together inParisuntil 1884, when a cholera outbreak forced them to return to Sweden.

Anna and Johan moved to Gothenburg, where Anna continued to paint.

Her paintings were included in Swedish exhibitions such as those of the Association of Swedish Female Artists. Artworks were also exhibited internationally such as at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago and in exhibitions inLondon, Montreal and Munich.

Between 1889 and 1890, the couple were the joint heads of the Gothenburg Drawing School (now known as the Valand Academy).

Many of Anna's artworks depict landscapes in or near Gothenburg.

Nature and the environment are recurring themes in Anna Gardell-Ericson's art.

She specialised in coastal scenes and landscapes with lakes or rivers. Inspired by French outdoor painting, her landscapes are romantic and idyllic. She often painted Visby, her hometown, and scenes from Marstrand, an island near Gothenburg where she and Johan Ericson often holidayed.

Anna Gardell-Ericson died in Stockholm in 1939, aged 85. Today her artworks are found in museums in Gothenburg and Stockholm, including the National Museum and several other museums aroundSwedenand abroad.

Photos capturing dramatic scenes of Finland's first-ever airline hijack

In the autumn of 1978, a dramatic airline hijacking took place in Finland - it was the first ever plane hijacking in Finland.

The scenes at Helsinki airport were captured by photographer Hannu Lindroos, which are now part of the collections of the Finnish Heritage Agency.

Finnair Flight 405 - a domestic flight between Oulu and Helsinki with 44 passengers - was hijacked on 30 September 1978 by Aarno Lamminparras, a 37-year-old unemployed building contractor.

Threatening the cabin crew with a loaded pistol, Lamminparras demanded ransom money and forced the pilots to fly the plane between Helsinki and Oulu. With ransom money paid and some hostages released, Lamminparras then demanded that the pilots fly to Schiphol airport inAmsterdam, where the plane refueled.

Then, returning to Helsinki, the remainder of Lamminparras's ransom demands were met and more hostages were released. Then the plane returned to Oulu.

Lamminparras's final demands included four bottles of whiskey, a chauffeured limousine and 24 hours alone at home with his wife. Having agreed to this, the final hostages were released. Lamminparras was arrested at his home on 1 October 1978, and later sentenced to seven years in prison.

As this was the first time this had happened inFinland, the event attracted a lot of media attention, which Lindroos's photography captures.

Reflecting on the past and present

Public monuments, memorials and art are often created and installed in urban environments. They aim to commemorate historical events, memorialise certain people, or even to help large spaces create a more intimate personal experience.

Urban environments provide accessible spaces for communicating ideas about history, culture and politics. They can work to construct ‘public memory’, often as declared by the victors of a certain nation, and can take on the function of significantlieux de mémoire(sites of memory). They can connect to ideas about a shared heritage and national identity, such as at the Nazaire French Military Cemetery, also known as 'Notre Dame de Lorette', which is dedicated to the fallen soldiers of WWI.

On one hand, this kind of heritage can be seen as honouring historical moments and people. On the other hand, we need to acknowledge that it is created by the economically and politically dominant group and can often be imposed on those that do not necessarily have such proposed shared heritage. Therefore, what is memorialised is often a controversial construction of heritage, and this kind of public art is vulnerable to strong reactions both for and against it.

We saw this especially after the murder of the American George Floyd in May 2020. The very history and ideals of the US were - and continue to be - laid bare for examination. This tragic event also led to frank discussions about public art and monuments and what they represent. These discussions also created ruptures in Europe and the UK.

Seen in the image above, Nelson’s Column in Trafalgar Square, London, was erected to honour Admiral Horatio Nelson. He defeated French leader Napoleon Bonaparte ensuring he would not invade Britain at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. Nelson vehemently opposed the abolition of slavery proclaimingin a letter:

I have ever been and shall die a firm friend to our present colonial system.

Thus, the hegemonic function of public commemorative art first noted in the 19th century with the emergence of a wealthy class who could afford to have it commissioned, reflected a silencing of other voices. The contributions of those who  were left out of the story are now being reexamined as a nation shifts how it  looks at its history.

For example, Black soldiers of the British Empire who served England during WWI were not acknowledged for the important contributions they made to the war effort in the same way as their white counterparts. The documentaryMemorials To The Missingby Stephen Wyatt, brings into focus the missing representation of Black soldiers in the Cenotaph War Memorial at Whitehall. The memorial has been the scene of protest during the 21st century, largely due to Britain's failure to recognise more than 45,000 soldiers who died in the war and who did not receive appropriate memorials. The history of WWI is not complete if Black and Asian people’s contributions are omitted in Europe.

Demonstrating against the memorialisation of a heritage of economic, social and political domination and a one-sided history that was not inclusive remains a concern for marginalised groups in many European nations.

In the 21st century, we are witnessing a marked shift away from a short-sighted understanding of certain historical events and a move toward a more nuanced approach - a way towards a creative public memorial that is more inclusive in its meaning.

In this way, memorialised events can bring attention not just to a mythic heroic understanding of national identity, but also to a history that includes oppression and prejudice. One important example of this is theDas Denkmal für die ermordeten Juden Europas(Memorial for the Murdered Jews of Europe in Berlin).

This memorial, designed by American architect Peter Eisenman, does not impose meaning, but rather in its construction represents a historical event and also invites its viewers to converse about representations such as state murder, loss of state and human rights, and responsibility for those actions against the sanctity of human existence. It encourages its audience to pause and compels them to consider history in all its horrific embodiment. This, in the end, should be the function of all memorials.

How people watched moving images at home in the early 20th century

Home cinema is a common practice in today's digital world. We consume movies, television series and social media videos at home on a daily basis. In times of YouTube and Netflix, watching moving images at home has become more popular and accessible than ever before.

Multiplehome cinema technologieshave been seen since the invention of cinema at the end of the 19th century - from screening reduction prints with analogue film projectors to viewing rental videos on the television screen with a VCR, all the way to DVDs, Blu-Rays and today's video streaming platforms.

In this blog post, we will look at one of the first home cinema technologies that emerged at the end of the 19th century: the Kinora.

While the Kinora is almost forgotten nowadays, it used to be a relatively popular technology for home entertainment in the early 20th century. According to the British film historian Barry Anthony, who reconstructed the history of the Kinora system in his bookThe Kinora: Motion Pictures for the Home, 1896-1914, it was even considered 'the most successful of the "home movie" machines marketed in Britain before 1912'.

The Kinora system was originally invented by Auguste and Louis Lumière in 1896, a year after they released theCinématographe. Instead of projecting moving images on a screen, like the Cinématographe and later home cinema systems, the Kinora was designed as an individual viewing machine similar to theMutoscope.

It made use of a flipbook mechanism to animate hundreds of paper-based photographs that were attached on a reel. By placing the reel on the Kinora viewer and turning the crank, the photographs were put in motion and could be watched while looking through the lens.

Kinora viewers varied from basic wooden hand-driven versions to luxury clockwork-driven models with multiple windows mounted on cast pedestals. The Kinora viewer depicted here is the basic model, which contains a wooden plate, a lens hood in the shape of a stereoscope viewer and two magnifying lenses inside this lens hood.

Part of the viewer's mechanism is a small metal stop that briefly pauses each of the curved image cards during rotation and thereby flattens them at the moment they become visible through the lens. This then creates an illusion of movement when watching the series of photographs in the viewer. Depending on the speed of rotation, a Kinora reel contains about 30-40 seconds of moving images.

A typical Kinora reel contains a brass core, which holds 640 curved photographic images printed on bromide paper with an image size of 24mm x 19mm each. The reel's brass core includes a small hole that is used to mount the reel to the Kinora viewer.

Hundreds of Kinora reels and various Kinora viewers were manufactured, especially in France and the United Kingdom. Most Kinora reels were printed reproductions of professionally shot films, which people could buy or rent for home viewing purposes.

A Kinora camera was introduced around 1908, which made it possible to make one's own Kinora home movies.

The camera recorded films on 1-inch (25.4mm) wide unperforated celluloid or light-sensitive paper. After recording, the film was developed and turned into a Kinora reel by the Kinora Company in London, so families could watch their own 'animated portraits' at home.

As part of the projectDoing Experimental Media Archaeology (DEMA)of the Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History (C2DH), a 3D model and replica of a Kinora were made in collaboration with the University of Luxembourg's Department of Engineering. The objective of theKinora replica projectwas to better understand how the Kinora worked and was used as a home cinema technology in the past.

Making a 3D replica provided the opportunity to do experiments that would not have been possible with the original object. For instance, by making a flexible lens hood on the replica viewer, the optimal magnification of the lenses and the distance between them could be tested. We furthermore tested the optimal distance between the lens and the image as well as the optimal relation between the recorded frame rate and the viewer's speed of rotation.

Besides a replica Kinora viewer, also a replica Kinora reel was made. For this, we used a sequence of images from a digitised 16mm home movie, which was converted into 640 successive frames.

With the help of a laser cutter machine in the Engineering 3D Lab, the images were cut in the same dimensions as the image cards on an original reel. The image cards were then attached and glued to a 3D printed core of the reel, after which they were curved using a rubber band to get the desired effect in the viewer.

Cristo de la Luz Mosque

Synagogue of Santa María la Blanca

Toledo Cathedral

How three buildings symbolise Toledo's religious heritage

Toledo is a historic city to the south of Madrid, the capital of Spain. In the medieval period, the city was home to three major religious communities: Christians, Muslims and Jews, each of whom have left impressions on the city's architecture.

Toledo's history stretches back centuries.

It was a significant Roman settlement, and, by the 6th century, was the capital of the Visigoths kingdom. It was an important city during Islamic rule in Spain, which began in the early 8th century. This was a period of religious tolerance, where Muslims, Christians, and Jews coexisted and contributed to the advancement of science, arts, and architecture.

In 1085, the Christian King of León and Castile besieged and captured the city. Over the years, Toledo had large communities of Jews and Muslims until they were expelled from Spain, respectively, in 1492 and 1502.

This complex history has left an architectural legacy in the city today. This blog focuses on three buildings - the Cristo de la Luz Mosque, the Synagogue of Santa María la Blanca and Toledo Cathedral - where history, culture and religious diversity converge.

The Cristo de la Luz Mosque was constructed in the 10th century during Islamic rule, one of ten mosques in the city at the time. During this time, the building was linked to one of the city gates.

It is a small square building, measuring around 8 metres by 8 metres. The mosque features distinct architectural elements and decorative details that are characteristic of Islamic design, including columns with horseshoe arches and intricate stucco work.

An inscription on the facade states that it was built by Musa Ibn Ali. Its eastern wall serves as the qibla wall, facing in the direction of Mecca for worship.

After the Christian conquest of Toledo, the mosque was converted into a Christian church. An apse was added to the building, marking the transition from Islamic to Christian use.

This synagogue is located in Toledo's former Jewish quarter and dates from either the late 12th or early 13th century.

It is a remarkable blend of Mudéjar and Gothic architectural styles, with distinctive white plasterwork. This has given the building the name Santa María la Blanca ('Saint Mary the White'). It has a series of arches supported on a network of octagonal columns.

In the 14th century, as a result of violence against Jews, the building was sacked and converted to Christian use. By the 15th century, it had been consecrated as a church. Over the centuries, it has been used as a military barracks, warehouse and a dancehall.

Even though it has not been used as a synagogue for centuries, it is one of the oldest synagogue buildings in Europe. Today, it is one of three preserved synagogue buildings in Toledo, and serves as amuseum.

Toledo Cathedral is a Gothic cathedral dating from the 13th century. It was built on the site of a cathedral which had been built over a mosque, after the Christian conquest of Toledo in the 11th century.

Construction of the awe-inspiring structure began in 1226. Its completion spanned several centuries. It was built with white limestone from the quarries near Toledo. The building has five naves, as well as a bell-tower and a 92 metre tall tower topped by a spire. Many elaborately decorated portals provide access to the interior from all sides of the building.

Its interior features elaborately carved altars, stunning stained glass windows, and intricate chapels that house artistic treasures and religious relics. Several monarches are buried in the Cathedral in sepulchres, such as Henry III the Infirm of Castile and Léon and Sancho II the Pious of Portugal.

During the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, various modifications were made to the cathedral. There is also a rich museum that has a series of paintings by El Greco, Francisco de Goya, Sir Anthony Van Dyck, Luis de Morales, and others.

The buildings share influences from traditional Islamic, Christian and Jewish architecutre, illustrating the often shared religious spaces in Toledo.

After the medieval period, Toledo's prosperity waned when King Philip II of Spain moved his court and capital to Madrid. The city of Toledo was declared a Historic-Artistic Site in 1940, and UNESCO later gave it World Heritage status in 1987.

Today, Toledo's religious heritage is a reflection of its complex history, where various religious communities coexisted.

Who was Felix Salten, the author ofBambi?

What is the novelBambiabout?

How Felix Salten'sBambibecame a film

Bambiis a beloved story which has entertained people for decades. Though the tale of the deer's life has been enjoyed by generations, many do not know the name of its author.

Felix Salten was a Jewish author born in Budapest whose work was remarkably different from the cute image by which we know Bambi today.

Born on 6 September 1869 as Siegmund Salzmann, his family moved to Vienna when he was just four weeks old. As a teenager, Salzmann had to drop out of school due to his family's financial difficulties. He started working for an insurance company, while also working on his writing.

His first publication came in 1889 when his poem was included in a literary journal, written under the name Felix Salten.

In 1890, his first novella was published. By 1900, he had published his first collection of short stories. Over the decades at the turn of the century, Salten was a prolific author. He wrote and edited newspapers, magazines and journals. He penned articles, plays, novels, film scripts and essays.

By 1910, he was regarded as one of the best journalists, dramatists and novelists inAustria.

Despite his many publications, one now stands out above all others.

The novelBambi, A Life in the Woods(Bambi. Eine Lebensgeschichte aus dem Walde) was published as a book in 1923.

It follows the life of a young deer as he navigates the complexities of the forest through his life to old age. The novel sparks conversations about nature, humans and the delicate balance between them.

It is often considered to be one of the firstenvironmentalnovels, and can also be read as an allegory for Jewish life in Europe. Intriguingly, despite the figure of a hunter being an antagonist in the novel, Salten himself was an avid hunter.

The novel had been serialised in a newspaper in 1922, with Salten considering it to be a tale for adults.

In 1928, an English translation of the novel was published by American writer Whittaker Chambers. He had a limited understanding of Austrian German, so many phrases and idioms were mistranslated. These changes meant that the deeper meaning of the novel was missed, and overall it had a softer tone.

Nevertheless, this translation became enormously popular and became a bestseller. More than 200 editions of the novel have been published since its publication.

In 1933, Salten sold the film rights for $1,000 to an American film director, who later transferred them to The Walt Disney Company.

The animated filmBambicame out in 1942, as a family film with cute woodland animals. Though some of the plot follows the original novel, it is generally softer and less violent.

By the time the film was released, life had changed drastically for Salten.

The rise of the Nazi Party after the annexation of Austria in 1938 meant that life for Jewish people in Vienna became severely restricted. Salten's books had been banned by Nazi Germany in 1936, but he was spared many of the harshest restrictions, perhaps due to his international reputation.

Salten's own political views were complicated and not easy to categorise. He supported Austro-Hungary duringWorld War I. Later, he admired radical, social, democratic parties, was a proponent of Zionism and even favoured some views of the Austrian authoritarian government.

Salten moved to Zurich, Switzerland with his wife in February 1939, joining his grown-up children there. He had received a visa with the condition that he could not work as a journalist. Salten died in Zurich in October 1945 and is buried in the city's Unterer Friesenberg Jewish Cemetery.

Today,Bambiis the only confirmed publication of Salten's still in print, a testament to the way this story - whether in its original German or the many translations or in its cartoon form - captured the hearts and imaginations of generations.

Gruesome stories of women being transformed to escape men in Ovid's ancient Greek text

The theme of men’s and gods’ greediness for women recurs very often in Ovid's Metamorphoses. Ovid's famous book focuses, as its name implies, on the metamorphosis of people, animals and gods in Greek mythology. Often, women are the ones that are changed as a result of trying to escape the courtings of Gods or the wrath of those gods' wives. Read more about Ovid's Metamorphoses in our first blog on the subject.

In the first book of the Metamorphoses Ovid writes about the god Apollo. Being struck by Eros' arrow, Apollo fell in love with the nymph Daphne, one of the subjects of the goddess Diana. Daphne turned down Apollo's courting and begged her father Peneus, the river deity, to change her appearance. The climax of the story is the metamorphosis of Daphne into a laurel tree.

Alpheus, river deity, was attracted by the beauty of the nymph Arethusa, who one day, after a long run in the woods, decided to cool off in a stream. While bathing, Arethusa heard a strange sounds coming from the depths of the stream. Terrified, she leapt out of the waters onto dry land. The sound turned out to be the god Alpheus who, attracted by her beauty and nakedness, leapt out of the stream after her. Desperate, the nymph called for the help of Artemis, goddess of the hunt, who enveloped her in a cloud and with a powerful breath pushed her in the direction of Sicily. Arriving near Ortygia, Arethusa turned into a fresh water spring, becoming one of the symbols of female resistance to male violence.

The story of Tereus and Philomela is a gruesome one. Procne, the daughter of the king of Athens, married Tereus, king of Thrace. The wedding was celebrated under a sign of bad luck: an owl, sent by the Erinyes, perched on their nuptial bed. The bride, struck with grief due to this bad omen, hoped that seeing her sister Philomela would help lift her spirits. Procne begged her new husband to go retrieve Philomela for her. When Tereus went to meet Philomela in Athens, he instantly fell in love with her and took her back home. There, he locked up his sister-in-law in a stable and brutally raped her. The young Philomela, outraged and destroyed in spirit, invoked the gods to punish the wicked Tereus. Tereus, fearing divine wrath, grabbed the girl and cut off her tongue with pincers so that she couldn't speak of his crimes.

Philomela, unable to speak, began weaving a web, with purple letters among the threads revealing what Tereus did. When Procne received this web, she read the painful story and decided to kill her and Tereus' son, Itys, in revenge. She served her son to Tereus as a meal before revealing to him that he had eaten their dead child. At this point, the gods intervened and transformed Procne into a swallow and Philomela into a nightingale, so that they could escape the wrath of Tereus.

San Pellegrino in Alpe Ethnographic Museum 'Don Luigi Pellegrini' in Italy

Skanzen, the Hungarian Open Air Museum in Hungary

Alytus Museum of Ethnography in Lithuania

National Museum of Ethnology of Portugal in Lisbon

Museums which shed a light on people and culture

Ethnographic museums are a specialised form of history museum that conserve, display and contextualise items relevant to the study of people and their histories. Ethnographic museums aim to give relevance to different cultures around the world, rather than just emphasising the chronology in the presentation of the various collections.

In this blog, we've gathered four ethnographic museums in different countries around Europe, which showcase cultures and traditions that may not be very known worldwide, in order to promote cultural tourism in European territories.

San Pellegrino in Alpe is the highest permanently inhabited area in the Apennine mountain range in Italy. It is both a part of two municipalities and two provinces, as well as two regions. Despite being geographically located on the Tuscan side of the Apennines, it constitutes an administrative part of Emilia-Romagna.

Since the Middle Ages, pilgrims and merchants have passed through San Pellegrino in Alpe. This made the village a crossing point that has hosted and seen many cultures throughout the centuries.

The Ethnographic Museum 'Don Luigi Pellegrini'preserves a collection of material culture objects.

It was created by Don Luigi Pellegrini in order to protect the traditions and aspects of life that have now almost completely disappeared from the rural civilisation of the Tuscan-Emilian Apennines. The collection hosts objects from the beginning of the 19th century to the present day: however, such tools have been used for centuries, and represent the material culture of a much more ancient civilisation.

The objects the museum collects come from the Appennine slopes both from the Tuscan and Emilian side, making it possible to make comparisons between the lives led in both areas that (although neighbouring and being historically linked through 400 years of Este family domination) have maintained distinct social, economic and linguistic characteristics.

Inspired by Skansen in Stockholm, the world’s oldest open air museum, the Hungarian Open Air Museum is the largest open air collection in Hungary, showing Carpathian folk architecture and life in various areas of Hungary. The museum covers 46 hectares, and is divided into eight parts, consisting of small villages each dedicated to a specific ethnographic region.

The museum undertakes research into Hungarian folk architecture, furnishings and traditional life. It collects and preserves tangible and intangible artefacts in places where Hungarian is spoken, in order to safeguard this heritage and provide access to this kind of knowledge.

Alongside the permanent museum, it also hosts numerous temporary exhibitions. To give  visitors an authentic picture of Hungarian ancient and rustic life, it’s possible to find master craftspeople working in the museum's courtyards, medicinal herbs and food being processed in its kitchens, and sheep grazing in pastures.

TheAlytus Museum of Ethnographyhas a vast legacy: founded in 1928 under as an initiative of the local intelligentsia, it holds more than 100,000 historical, ethnographic and archaeological, photographic (and more) antiques in nature, all from districts Alytus, Varėna, Lazdijai and Druskininka in southern Lithuania.

The museum hosts antiquities that originate from the Mesolithic period up until 2009, giving an extensive view on southern Lithuanian history.

The most famous objects of the museum are authentic monuments of natural, ethnic and spiritual culture.

It also houses many science and technology objects that help to speculate and study occupations, crafts, and overall everyday life of people in past centuries. Authentic documents and objective material depicting the history of rebellions, wars, resistance movements, deportation, exile and armed resistance also depict a side of the culture that is often overlooked in ethnographic museums.

The collections of theNational Museum of Ethnologyin Lisbon holds the most relevant ethnographic heritage of Portugal.

The museum has two separate collections. The first, with pieces from the 'Popular Art Museum', was assembled mostly in the 1930s and early 1940s for propaganda exhibitions promoted by the dictatorship regime of Estado Novo, which began in 1933. The second collection holds representative objects of 80 countries and 5 continents, with greater emphasis on cultures from Africa, Asia and South America, and, most of all, traditional Portuguese culture.

Since 2000, objects - such as traditional agricultural technologies, traditional music instruments and home utensils  - have been displayed in the museum's Portuguese Rural Life Galleries. The vast majority of these objects were gathered in the 1960s and 1970s, but also date back to earlier periods.

Furthermore, in January 2013, the museum presented its permanent exhibition 'The museum, many things'. It is built around seven different sets of objects which change regularly, in order to offer visitors different foods for thought. The great diversity of the collections can be discovered not only in the permanent and temporary exhibitions, but also in the museum's storage rooms, which are also accessible if booked in advance.

Since its creation, the museum has organised around 40 exhibitions, some of which became a landmark regarding the knowledge of the worlds explored and analysed in the publications that followed them.

Ethnographic museums offer a way to analyse history and culture from a point of view that is sometimes overlooked: more from the perspective of the people than historical events. Culture, tradition and folklore are fundamental for current generations to better understand our heritage and to preserve customs to pass to the next, while also disseminating them around the world.

5 sites across Europe that commemorate mining's rich industrial heritage

Often passed over in favour of more popular tourism destinations, the remnants of the mining industry can be part of an interesting discovery during cultural holidays. The industry has left behind a large amount of tangible and intangible heritage that offers many different experiences and insight all across Europe.

In this blog, we’re showcasing five stories regarding mining heritage and the cultural organisations  which preserve it, from five different parts of Europe.

The city of Banská Štiavnica has been connected with mining and rich deposits of precious metals since ancient times. Although no one really remembers when exactly it all started, an old legend about little lizards that gave Banská Štiavnica its wealth and fame is part and parcel of Slovakian cultural heritage.

According to the legend, a 13th century shepherd named Ján was one day driving his  herd out to pasture. While admiring the view and looking at the animals, he noticed some lizards basking in the sun on a big rock in the distance. He saw two in particular which shone with a kind of strange light as if they were forged from silver or gold. When he tried to get closer, they hid under the boulder. Ján rolled over the rock with great difficulty and soon noticed a lump of gold as huge as a hat hiding under it.

The rumour about this discovery spread easily in the city. People began to converge from everywhere. They dug shafts into the ground, and later created whole mines and settlements next to them. They built beautiful houses, churches, schools and gave birth to a city nestled in a valley, a city that today proudly bears the name Banská Štiavnica.

Mining heritage is not necessarily limited to caves and machinery, but also to  historical events that shaped today’s world, such as the UK Miners Strike of 1984-1985.

The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) went on strike to oppose the decision of the British Government to close collieries, which would have resulted in mass unemployment. The strike lasted a year, and was supported by many associations.

A noteworthy collaboration was between three valleys in the South of Wales (Neath, Dulais and Swansea) and the Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners Association in London. The latter raised almost £23,000 to support families who were on strike by organising fundraising events, and paying mutual visits.

An archive of the London group's work is kept at thePeople's History Museumin Manchester. It includes the minutes of the weekly meetings, correspondence, press cuttings, publicity material, enamel badges, photographs and the group's banner.

During the Cold War era, when demand for uranium was sky-high, a small mine operated from 1959 to 1961 near Paukkajanvaara, in the municipality of Eno in Finland.

It produced up to 30 tons of uranium concentrate. After the main ore body was exhausted the mine was closed, due to the decreasing demand for the material. The mine had been abandoned until the 1990s, when the area was rehabilitated, lowering the radiation in the site to the normal Finnish background levels.

Today, the site is an important field laboratory where the release of radioactive elements from uranium mining into the environment can be studied, providing  knowledge regarding a renewed interest in uranium exploration in Finland.

This mine is currently not open for visits, but a vast variety of tours in many different mines in Finland are possible, such as the wonderfulAmethyst Minein the Pyhä-Luosto National Park, andTytyri Mine, a still functioning mine near Helsinki, which both offer guided tours for tourists to discover Finland’s rich mining heritage.

TheCoal Mining Museum in Velenje, Slovenia, was founded in 1957 under the patronage of the Cultural Centre Ivan Napotnik Velenje.

Currently, the underground part of the museum is under reconstruction, but it’s possible to visit the above ground part of the mine. The museum offers a 360 experience and allows visitors to learn about coal mining conditions from the early days through to the present.

Dressed in mining clothes, an overcoat, and a helmet, it’s possible to visit the coal mine, going 160 metres deep, and a miner’s apartment. In the underground tunnels it’s also possible to see a vivid demonstration of how the miners’ work looked like in the past and how it does today, becoming familiar with the mine machinery.

Cyprus has rich and significant historical ties with copper.

On a self-driving route, it's possible to visit various copper mines and associated sites. The tour passes through many villages, the Mathiatis Copper Mines and theMuseum of Mining Heritage in Kadydata. It tells the fascinating story of how Cyprus was the largest producer and exporter of the metal to the ancient world for many centuries, and its role in shaping the island’s history.

Pure copper was a material fundamental for the development of large civilisations around the island and, by mining it, Cyprus contributed to the technological progress of the entire Mediterranean world and beyond.

The Cyprus Copper Route is an innovative way to visit the island, learn about its history and  reveals a history that may not be very well known, but will definitely amaze visitors who are up for a non-conventional tourist experience.

Europe is full of stories regarding mining heritage - and many of them are yet to be discovered.

By encouraging sustainable tourism and the diffusion of lesser known tangible and intangible heritage, we hope to spur the interest both of the institutions to enhance their legacy and tourists to engage with the latter, so that it can become more and more well known as time passes.

Explore Audrey Rose Mizzi's commentary on how Malta became a leader in LGBTIQ+ rights, created as part of the Europeana Digital Storytelling Festival Creative Online Residency

In May-June 2023, eight participants took part in the first ever Online Creative Residency from Europeana’s Digital Storytelling Festival. They worked with mentors in animation, social media stories and new writing relating to LGBTQ+ culture and communities.

Malta, a small island in the Mediterranean Sea is gay friendly for a reason. Using an Instagram carousel, Audrey Rose Mizzi explores how this historic island went from being conservative to being a leader in LGBTIQ+ rights.

Explore her post and find out more about Audrey below.

A post shared by Europeana (@europeana_eu)

Who am I?

My name is Audrey and I'm work in Marketing and Communications as an executive at Spazju Kreattiv, Malta's National Centre for Creativity. I've studied Art History, Preventive Conservation as well as Museum and Gallery Studies and have worked with institutions on different jobs from front of house to documentation and collections care.

Why did I apply to the Digital Storytelling Online Creative Residency?

I applied for the residency as I find storytelling intriguing - whether you're using it to tell a story that is fiction or non-fiction. In social media, I've learned that stories are important especially when they come from individuals who have experienced, or are closely related to the subject you're discussing. The residency focused on LGBTIQ+ stories, so I was a bit out of my depth, but similarly I wanted to look into subjects like this and contribute to the ever-growing discourse.

What have I got out of the residency?

For me personally, it was important not to harm the community and bring it into focus. The topic I chose is also very sensitive, and can easily lead down a rabbit hole of negativity. Malta being deemed the safest place for LGBTIQ+ individuals for the 8th time in a row is surprising, considering that socially there's so much more to be done. Whether it's fear of the unknown, or religion, what's written on paper is not translated in real life. That's what I wanted to work on, and am still working on.

Artworks by Spanish artist Joaquín Sorolla y Bastida, known for his luminous, outdoor scenes, evoke the sensations, light and spirit of summer. His paintings capture the quintessential sunshine experiences of visiting the beach with families, depicting lazy days and happy times.

Sorrolla was born in Valencia in 1863 but lived most of his adult life in Madrid, following periods living in Rome and Paris as young man. His home in Madrid is now amuseum.

Sorolla's artistic career lasted decades, during which he produced a great range of paintings in a varitey of styles.

He produced large canvases with mythological and historical subjects. He depicted social realities of life in late Spain at the turn of the century in paintings.

While not his preferred genre, he also painted many portraits as commissions. He  became a respected portrait artist, depicting many important people in Spanish society.

In 1888, he married Clotilde García del Castillo. Together, they had three children: Maria, born in 1890, Joaquín, born in 1892, and Elena, born in 1895.

In the summers, he liked to return to the coast - to Valencia, northern Spain and Biarritz among others - with his family and friends. There, he painted many artworks which earned him his nickname as the 'Painter of Light'.

Mostly painted towards the end of this long career, these paintings of sun-drenched summer beaches stand out. They feature bright light and summer colours, from vibrant blue skies, crystal turquoise waters and golden sands.

One such painting -Strolling along the Seashore- was painted in 1909. Sorolla's wife, Clotilde, and their eldest daughter, María, walk at sunset along a beach. The glistening Mediterranean waters, the shimmering sand, and the casually dressed figures exude an atmosphere of carefree summer days.

Sorolla painted outdoors, which allowed him to observe and replicate the ever-changing nuances of natural light. This play of light and colour in his beach and summer scenes, making these artworks a testament to his extraordinary talent.

The Türbe (tomb) of Sheikh Mustafa is one of the oldest Islamic sacred buildings remaining from the Ottoman period in Belgrade.

Located at the top of Filipa Višnjića Street, near the Student Park and the Faculty of Science, it has endured for centuries, defying the merciless ravages of time. This blog looks at the history of the Türbe of Sheikh Mustafa, an important site in the Islamic history of Belgrade.

Turbehis a Turkish word for a tomb or mausoleum where notable and wealthy people are buried. Türbes are usually quadrangular in shape (and can also be hexagonal or octagonal), modelled after the shape of a tent from the pre-Islamic era. They can be open or closed, with a dome or four-sided roof, arches or windows.

Dating from the end of the 18th century, this türbe is hexagonal and built from stone. Its interior is decorated with inscriptions from the Quran, while in the middle of the room there is a covered sarcophagus marking the grave.

The Türbe of Sheikh Mustafa, is dedicated to Mustafa of Baghdad, the head of the Haji-Sheikh Muhamed’s Tekke (Zawiya or Khanqah, a building designed specifically for gatherings of a Sufi brotherhood), which was once located in that place. A lot is known about the Tekke's history, and a lot has been preserved. There is a preserved photograph of the Tekke, so it is known what it looked like. On the Austrian miliatry officer Brusch's plan of 1789, the tekke was drawn just opposite the early 17th-century Kizlar-Aga Mosque.

During the Serbian Uprising 1804-1813 the Tekke served for some time as the seat of the Executive Council, the highest authority in the newly established state. Also, Dositej Obradović, a Serbian writer, biographer, diarist, philosopher, pedagogue, educational reformer, linguist, polyglot and the first minister of education of Serbia died in it in 1811.

A tekke is a sacred Islamic building where Islamic mystics or Sufis (dervishes) gather. It also served as a place where religious ceremonies were performed. Usually, türbes were erected next to tekkes.

There was a lively Sufi activity in Belgrade’s past, evidenced by the information provided in the travelogue by a famous Turkish travel writer Evliya Çelebi. He wrote that, in the middle of the 16th century, there were 17 Sufi lodges (tekkes) in Belgrade. Moreover, in the period between 1521 and 1867, dervishes lived in Belgrade, gathered in tekkes and regularly performed one of the most important Sufi rituals called zikr or dhikr (basically the invocation of God’s name).

Dervishes also had their own street in Belgrade called Dervish Street which was located on Dorćol (the Turkish word for crossroad) and in which, according to Evliya Çelebi, one of the oldest Sufi buildings in Belgrade was located ‒ the Tekke of Mehmed Pasha Yahyali.

Out of all of those buildings and traces of Sufi activity in Belgrade, only the Türbe of Sheikh Mustafa was preserved as a reminder of long-gone times and represents one of the most distinguished elements of Muslim heritage in Belgrade.

In the inscription, carved in 1783 on the türbe by the scribe (in Turkishdefterdar) Husni Yusuf, it is written that Sheikh Mustafa was a Sadi, which means he was a member of the Saʼdiyya tariqat or dervish order. Based on this, it can be assumed that the tekke, which was once located near the türbe, gathered members of this tariqa, which is considered a predominantly military tariqa, such as the famous Bektashis and Rifais.

Despite years of neglect and oblivion, the Türbe of Sheikh Mustafa, now shines in its full glory.

Thanks to the funding provided by the Turkish Agency for Cooperation and Coordination in Belgrade (TIKA), on behalf of the Government of Turkey, the restoration of this building was completed in 2013. The restoration project was financed by the Ministry of Culture, and it was carried out by the City Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments.

The building, however, remains closed (except during the Museums Day which is organised every May. Although its interior is mostly modest and simple, curious passers-by and tourists still have an opportunity to peek through the windows into the türbe, which is one which is one of the rare buildings of this kind in Belgrade.

In 2019, a group of dervishes (Islamic mystics) from Kosovo visited the capital of Serbia. Upon their arrival in Belgrade, they headed to the Türbe of Sheik Mustapha where they held a dervish ritual or zikr. For the first time in 236 years, they gathered to pay their respects to their spiritual leader.

With the restoration of the Türbe of Sheikh Mustafa, another building from Belgrade’s Islamic past will begin to live a new life. The city itself gets another restored cultural monument on the map of its important cultural and historical monuments to be proud of and thus confirm its epithet of being a 'city between East and West'.

Some horrible story highlights from Ovidius' ancient Greek text

The Metamorphoses, written by the Latin poet Publius Ovidius Naso in the first century AD, during the Augustan age, is a mythological poem written in hexameter. It's made up of more than two hundred tales starting with primordial chaos and ending with the apotheosis of Caesar and the glorification of Augustus. The legacy of this work, which - according to some scholars - was conceived for a female audience, was enormous and it has been a rich source of inspiration for literary and figurative works for centuries.

In this blog we'll focus on the representation of the female gender in Ovid's Metamorphoses, with a selection of stories related to motherhood.

To narrate the miraculous birth of the god Bacchus, Ovid writes that Jupiter has fallen in love with Semele (III, 259-315). This angers his wife, Juno. When Juno learns that Semele is pregnant with Jupiter's child, she decides to take revenge. Descending from Olympus, she takes on the appearance of Semele's wet nurse and works to become Semel's friend, until Semele confides in Hera that the father of Semele's child is actually the god Jupiter. Hera, in disguise, plants seeds of doubt in Semele's mind, leading Semele to go to Jupiter and ask for a blessing. Jupiter is only happy to comply with this request, but the blessing Semele asks for is for Jupiter to reveal himself in his full divinity to her, as was suggested to her by Hera. Little does Semele know that mortals cannot live after having seen divinity, and Semele is incinerated by Jupiter's lightning bolts.

Shortly before the death of his beloved, Jupiter extracts his child Bacchus from Semele's belly and sews it into his thigh to bring the pregnancy to term.

Another story of motherhood is that of Alcmena (IX, 275-305) who gives birth to Hercules after uniting with Jupiter. Once again Juno does everything to hinder the birth.

When Alcmena goes into labour, she loudly invokes Lucina, protector of women in labour. Lucina, however, has been corrupted by Juno, so Lucina clasps her hands together to prevent Alcmena's painful labour to end.  The sly maid Galanthis, however, lies and announces that the child has been born. When Lucina hears this, she stands up amazed, undoing her clasped hands, which allows for the labour to finish and the child to actually be born. Realizing the deception, Lucina throws Galanthis to the ground and transforms Galanthis into a weasel. For having helped a woman in labor by using her mouth for a lie, Galanthis would be forced to give birth through her mouth.

Another story linked to motherhood is that of the beautiful Dryope (IX, 324-293), deprived of her virginity by Apollon, who forcefully imposed himself on her. The unfortunate girl married Andraemon who, happy to marry her, fathered a son with her. Unaware of her fate, with her little son in her arms, Dryope went to a lake surrounded by myrtle shrubs to offer flowers to the nymphs. Not far away grew a flowering water lotus tree. Dryope picked some flowers, but drops of blood began to ooze from the cut flowers. Too late the girl realized that she had done a slight to the nymph Lotis, who had turned into a tree as part of a different story.

The nymph's wrath was implacable: in the span of a few moments, she pulled Dryope to where Lotis was standing and transformed her into a lotus plant. With her face not yet changed into a trunk, she sent a last greeting to her sister and her husband who had come to help her, urging them to detach their little son from her branches. She then asked them to entrust him to a nurse, who occasionally took him to play near the tree, teaching him not to pick the flowers from any plants because a goddess could be hidden in each of them.

1950s: the golden age of 3D

The demise of three-dimensions

The computer-generated environment - the third three-dimensional age?

The future of 3D

Saving the past for the future

EUreka3D – preparing for the future of 3D

Don't you think this three-dimensional business can go too far?

A short history and possible future of 3D digitisation in cultural heritage

When recently at The Cartoon Museum in London, I was struck by a cartoon by Roland Emett fromPunch Magazinein 1953: 'Don't you think this three-dimensional business can go too far?'

Being a partner in theEUreka3Dproject - which aims to build the capacity of small cultural heritage institutions particularly related to 3D digitisation - I found this cartoon both relevant and funny. It also made me realise that rendering a 3D world is not a new technology and our fascination for an artificial three dimensional world goes back even further than the 70 years of that cartoon.

Firstly, when we talk about 3D digitisation and 'looking at 3D', one must acknowledge that a three-dimensional representation, in any form, is an illusion made up of two-dimensional planes.

Ancient Greek mathematicianEuclid, in the third century BC, recorded that the right and left eyes view an image slightly differently. It is this difference that makes the illusion of three dimensions possible.

Almost from the birth of photography, in 1839, photographic prints called stereotypes were created using cameras that had two lenses, producing photographs that captured the moment of the scene from the perspective of both the left and right eye. Using a viewer called a stereoscope, the resulting 3D illusion became extremely popular and the images were widely reproduced for general sale to an amazed public.

An alternative method of reproducing an image in 3D was to separate it into two different colour channels. Wearing 3D glasses with the same colours on opposite eyes would then create the illusion.

A more recent foray into printed 3D illusion is the MagicEye books that became popular in the 1990s.

Following a similar timeline and technique of still images, 3D films were being attempted from the mid 19th century.

In 1895, the famous French Lumière brothers presented the 50 second film,L’Arrivee du Train. It was an attempt to create a 3D illusion and shows a locomotive train arriving at speed into La Ciotat Station. Reportedly, many moviegoers thought the train was going to crash into the theatre where they were seated and fled in absolute terror.

Louis Lumière later re-filmed the scene using a 3D stereoscopic film camera and exhibited it at a meeting in the French Academy of Science in 1934.

With the arrival of stereoscopic colour and sound, the 1950s became the 'golden age' of 3D cinema. This is the era of the iconic 3D glasses, and also, the basis of the cartoon depicted inPunch Magazineat the beginning of this blog.

3D would even arrive on television, withFort Ti, starring George Montgomery and Joan Vohs - no surprises that it aired in the very same year, 1953.

The expense of creating 3D films stunted not only the first golden age but subsequent attempts to revive its popularity.

When digital cameras emerged in the early 21st Century, it was falsely anticipated that the costs to produce and show 3D films (essential without two analogue film stocks) would significantly reduce.

James Cameron made the first full-length 3D film using digital cameras in high definition,Ghosts of the Abyss, in 2003. Then, in 2009, he releasedAvatar(in 3D). It has remained the highest-grossing film of all time.

As an eager public bought expensive 3D televisions to watch, primarily live sport, in a digital revolution that seemed ready to make three-dimensional viewing commonplace. Sadly, the demand once again failed to make it an economically viable risk to continue.

Now, as we approach the end of the first quarter of the 21st Century, are we ready to be immersed in a new 3D environment?

Three-dimensional computer-generated models are being created by professionals and amateurs alike, from both real and imagined source material, or combination of both. Much of this is due to the technology that layers and interlinks still imagery into fully multi-perspective frames.

These 3D models are only seen by users as 2D representations at the current rendered viewing point. These 3D models consist of layered and meshed 2D photographs, often thousands, taken from as many angles as necessary. The illusion of three dimensions is generated as the computer seamlessly renders a pre-existing perspective of the photographs based on how users change their plane of view.

3D models can be rendered on a simple, two-dimensional, computer monitor, or combined to be viewed in a fully immersive virtual reality experience. Models can also be printed on 3D printers, often bringing an imagined 3D into a real one.

Vast investment by companies, like Facebook’s Meta, into theMetaversegive a hint of where we might be headed in the 3D future.

In this virtual space, we may find ourselves entering an interconnected imagined and immersive three-dimensional world, reminiscent of Ernest Cline’sReady Player Onewhere we live the majority of our lives plugged into an enhanced computer-generated world instead of our real world.

Even as we enter this metaverse, not all of it will be a brand-new world, a large part will be an old world re-imagined.

Cultural Heritage institutions are already active in digitising their collections. The European Commission recentlyrecommendedthat 'by 2030, Member States are encouraged to digitise in 3D all monuments and sites deemed at risk', including the most physically-visited cultural and heritage monuments, buildings and sites.

3D, therefore, is seen as a tool that we can use to create sustainable environments, to protect a fragile world and make it more accessible and immersive for those who may have difficulty visiting the many special places we have inherited from our ancestors.

TheEUreka3D projectis laying the foundations for this new 3D world.

We are creating a best practice framework for cultural heritage institutions to prepare, digitise, annotate, and store their 3D models - making them accessible for professionals, educators, and the wider public to learn and enjoy three dimensional objects in a multi-perspective experience.

In answering the question of the 1953Punch Magazinecartoon, we, therefore, need to approach 3D beyond simplistic entertainment value.

It is safe to say that a life constrained to a virtual 3D world will not be as fulfilling as the real world, but a life without 3D might leave many parts of the real world vulnerable to loss.

When you work in cultural heritage, the missing pieces are always gaping.

Fragments of text which mention something incredible that is never to be seen. A fading photograph which captures a single moment which doesn’t say who, what, where, when… why? A crackling audio tape which records an unknown voice in an unknown place.

Three-dimensional digitisation adds more, at least in a visual sense, to the valuable historical record and for the objects and sites that sit in a physically challenging and changing environment, we may only have one small window to preserve it.

By enabling and expanding the capacity to digitise in three-dimensions, we may finally be ready for the world to embrace 3D, and not let go.

This blog is part of theEUreka3D project, which aims to build the capacity of small cultural heritage institutions in digital transformation, particularly on issues related to 3D digitisation.

Saint John's Co-Cathedral

Rotunda of Mosta

Ta' Pinu Basilica

Mdina Cathedral

Exploring the Mediterranean island nation's religious cultural heritage

Malta is a small island nation in the heart of the Mediterranean, home to impressive churches and cathedrals.

The nation's religious history has led to stunning buildings, which are important religious places of worship in a variety of architectural styles.

Let's explore four of the most beautiful churches and cathedrals in Malta.

Saint John's Co-Cathedral is located in the centre of Valletta, Malta's capital city.

It was built by the Order of Saint John in the 16th century by the Maltese architectGirolamo Cassar.

While the exterior of the church is relatively plain and simple, its ornate interior - which dates from the 17th century - is considered one of the finest examples of high baroque architecture in Europe.

Designed in the 1660s by architect Mattia Preti, its walls and ceilings are adorned with paintings, sculptures, carvings and frescoes.

One of the most important paintings is Carravaggio'sThe Beheading of Saint John the Baptist, painted in 1608. It is the largest canvas he painted, and the only which is signed by the Italian artist.

The floor is made from marble tombstones, while its altar is a masterpiece of gilded woodwork.

The Rotunda of Mosta - also known as the Sanctuary Basilica of the Assumption of Our Lady - is the parish church of Mosta in the north of Malta.

It is the largest church in Malta and is famous for its dome, which is one of the largest unsupported domes in the world.

Today's building is in a neoclassical style, and was completed in the 1860s around an existing church building, having taken 28 years to build. Designed by architect Giorgio Grognet de Vassé, it was based on the Pantheon in Rome.

DuringWorld War II, the church was targetted by three bombs dropped by Nazi Germany. Two deflected off the roof, but one pierced the dome and entered the church. Luckily, it did not explode and was safely defused. This event has been interpreted by locals as a miracle.

Ta' Pinu - the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Blessed Virgin - is a national shrine on the island of Gozo. It is located in the countryside, surrounded by fields.

The church building was built in a neo-romantic style in the early 20th century. It is dedicated to the grace of Our Lady of the Assumption, after a number of miracles were attributed to her in the late 19th century.

Due to the lack of buildings around it, its large belltower at 61 metres is a feature of the Gozo skyline.

The interior of the church has a high vaulted ceiling, 76 stained glass windows, 6 mosaics and many votive shrines.

Mdina Cathedral is located in Mdina, a medieval walled city which was the capital of Malta uptomedieval times. It is also known as Saint Paul's Cathedral.

A cathedral has stood on its site since the 12th century, believed to be where the Roman governor Publius met Saint Paul who was shipwrecked on Malta.

The original cathedral was damaged in an earthquake in 1693. The current building was built between 1696 and 1705 by Maltese architect Lorenzo Gafà.

The cathedral is built in the Baroque style. Its exterior has some influences from existing Maltese architecture and features bell towers housing six bells.

The interior features many frescoes, most notably those on the ceiling which depict scenes from the life of Saint Paul which were painted in the late 18th century by the Sicilian painters Vincenzo, Antonio and Francesco Manno.

About the author

Discover Joseph Degabriele’s reflections on coming out, developed as part of the Europeana Digital Storytelling Festival Creative Online Residency.

In May-June 2023, eight participants took part in the first ever Online Creative Residency from Europeana’s Digital Storytelling Festival. They worked with mentors in animation, social media stories and new writing relating to LGBTQ+ culture and communities. Joseph Degabriele explored the concept of ‘coming out’. Read his story and find out more about Joe below.

By definition, ‘coming out is a process, an act of socially, psychologically and politically recognising and acknowledging a sexuality and/or gender identity of oneself and sharing it with others.’

However, in practice the words ‘coming out’ are more than that...

They contain depths of reflection, levels of experimentation, discovery of the body, until one realises, admits, accepts and finds comfort and peace into his or her true self.

A journey of unleashing and discovering freedom. Hopefully a journey not done in solitude!

How would you feel if you were restricted in a space that limits you from being you, that imposes you to hide who you are?

Similar to Stockholm Syndrome, and probably without realising it, the ‘space that limits you’ can be a comforting illusion of safety.

Can you live in a limiting illusion?

Just like when the sun blinds us when we walk out of the dark, walking away, coming out of that space of safety is an unknown overwhelming step, paved with fear and self-judgement. Do you have faith that those around you will embrace you no matter what? Will you embrace yourself?

Those tiny steps of walking out can be the steps that uncover…

the warm embrace of your mother who whispers 'you are my son, no matter what',

a tearful tap on the shoulder from your father who smiles and says 'I love you as you are',

a tight hug from your friend of 21 years who says 'I can see you are truly free now',

a squeeze on the hand from your friend who says 'I am so happy you found the courage',

a wink from your older brother who reassures you that 'everyone got to live his life',

countless kisses from your two sisters who simply 'have your back'.

These moments enriched with meaningful words weave a coming out, that after the eyes settle to the shining sun, show you the clarity, show you the support of the family, the reassuring friendships, the chats and discussions of people who want to understand and learn.

Happy tears trickling down the face, and a heart beating with love!

Should this be the experience of every queer member?

Why cannot we ensure the queer community to a safe and welcoming coming out?

The queer community has many hurdles, the bullying in the streets, denial by their families, religions preaching against them, politics denying their rights, traditions leaving them unacknowledged or cultures who do not give them a seat at the table. That is why freedom and the rights should never be taken for granted. That is why our voices need to be heard in support of those who are not feeling safe enough to come out!

If you are struggling to come out, if fear is getting the best of you, reach out to professionals who can guide you in this journey, but never lose hope, never get comfortable sitting in the closet, the world needs to see the full you!

Who am I?

I am Joseph, a 29-year-old teacher from Malta. My passions include community development, education and the arts. I love participating in projects that involve all three and through such projects continue to broaden my knowledge through the stories and experiences of others.

Why did I apply to the Digital Storytelling Online Creative Residency?

I applied for the residency as I always wanted an opportunity through which I could practise my writing. I believe through this experience I have understood more about my process of writing and also discovered tools which can help me to further develop my writing experience.

What have I got out of the residency?

I decided to focus my writing on the process of coming out, a process which can be daunting but a very positive one.

Where might I go from here?

Although I have not fully figured out a plan, I do hope that I will pursue writing different pieces, especially pieces that focus on the positive side of things, pieces that shed light on the good side of things.

First sightings of the Loch Ness Monster

A beloved Scottish icon

Hunting for Nessie

Killing the Loch Ness Monster

Could there by any truth to the claim in Mussolini's newspaper that his army killed the Loch Ness Monster?

Some creatures of folklore are made of myth alone - mermaids, unicorns, werewolves, leprechauns. But there are some for whom not quite enough evidence exists to disprove their existence and so they remain at large - at least in our imaginations. For some people, anecdotal evidence, old grainy videos or blurry photographs taken from long distances do indeed prove the existence of the likes of the yeti, Bigfoot, the chupacabra, or indeed a giant sea serpent lurking among the deep dark waters of Loch Ness, Scotland.

‘Nessie’ the Loch Ness Monster came into the public consciousness in 1933 when George Spicer and his wife claimed to have seen the monster cross the road in front of their car and head into Loch Ness - Scotland’s largest lake.

This story was published in December 1933 by local Scottish newspapers like The Falkirk Herald and taken up by English publications like the London Weekly Dispatch and the Sunday Mirror. It captured imaginations far beyond its native Scotland as you can see in this image by Danish cartoonist, Herluf Jensenius, from 1934.

But this story goes back further, to the sixth century CE, and involves an Irish monk called St Columba, and aconfrontation with a water beastin the River Ness (which feeds into Loch Ness). This beast is said to have killed one man, but to have been warded off another by Columba making the sign of the cross and banishing the beast into Loch Ness.

Centuries later, Nessie is a much-loved Scottish icon, well woven into folklore, popular culture, tourist trails and gift shop merchandise.

Listen to children from 1954 singing ‘I’m a monster o’ Loch Ness’:

I'm the monster o Loch Ness,My name shall never guessI shall twirl in a ringAnd do the Highland fling,I'm the monster o Loch Ness.

People continue to hunt for Nessie even now, using new technology as it evolves - from photographs to video, sonar, and even satellite imagery and DNA identification technology. So far, no conclusive evidence has been found to say for sure that a monster exists. Is that because the search area is so large? Loch Ness contains more water than all the lakes, rivers and reservoirs in England and Wales put together!

Or, could it be because Nessie was killed in the 1940s by the Italian army?

I was alerted to this ridiculous story by a line in a children’s history book. In a chapter about Urquhart Castle, the remains of which lie on the banks of Loch Ness, thisHorrible Historiesbook (Crackin’ Castles, by Terry Deary, Scholastic, London, 2016, p143) reports that ‘In 1941 an Italian newspaper reported that the bombing of Scotland was so heavy, the Loch Ness Monster was killed by a direct hit.’

Could there be any truth to this at all? Was it merely a silly joke, or was there something more sinister behind the story?

It turns out, there is some truth to the story. That is to say, it is true that Nessie was the subject of debate and propaganda in World War II. And that there were media reports of the Italians claiming to have killed her. But before that, Nessie had already raised her watery head within the fascist regime - Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels cited the British people’s belief in the monster as a sign of their weakness and inability to win the war (seeMilitary.com).

Perhaps the regime thought that news of Nessie’s demise would demoralise the country, because in December 1940, Scottish newspaper the Aberdeen Press and Journal presented‘GOEBBELS' "MONSTER" FAIRY TALE’, reporting as follows:

HERE is Dr Goebbels' latest whopper, given out by the Nazicontrolled Radio Paris yesterday:— "It is reported from Glasgow, via Stockholm, that the Loch Ness monster has struck a mine, and its body has been found washed ashore in pieces on the West of Scotland." Speyside Masonic appointment—Br. Alexander Millar, who has been appointed Right Worshipful Master of Lodge St John (No. 1021), Aberlour.

But Nessie must have had a reprieve because the following year, in mid June 1941, the story goes that Mussolini’s Italian newspaperIl Popolo D’Italiatook this idea further and published an incredible report claiming that an Italian pilot had dropped a bomb on Nessie herself, asserting that the pilot even saw her body float to the surface. As yet, I haven’t found a copy of the original story - perhaps the whole story is as much a myth as the monster itself - but Australia’sThe World’s Newsreported it as follows, illustrated with cartoons by Phil Litchfield:

The Italian paper, “Popolo d’Italia,” solemnly announced that one of Mussolini’s big planes, while raiding England, had bombed and destroyed a huge, serpent-like animal on the surface of Loch Ness.

But rather than dissuade, demoralise or embarrass the Brits, this story was seized upon by those Allied newspapers around the world with a sense of humour - if not a good knowledge of the distinction between England and Scotland. The media soon added an epilogue in which a local man and his son saw Nessie alive and well not long after the alleged bombing, turning Nessie not into a symbol of weakness but into a veritable war hero. The World’s News continues:

Possibly scarred and even shell-shocked, he seems to have returned perhaps from repairs at some deep-sea wetdock, and outwardly as good as ever. "Stout fella!" say the English, pleased as well as amused. He may be a monster, but he has some sturdy, bulldog characteristics which the British admire.

What do you think? Is Nessie out there? And if she is, what is she? Some kind of gigantic eel? A prehistoric reptile descended from dinosaurs? Or is she a mirage? Simply some tourism-boosting propaganda?

For now at least, the mystery and the legend continue.

Who am I?

My name is Eleni Maragkou, and I am a writer, editor, and researcher in the field of new media and online culture. Originally from Athens, Greece, I am currently based in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

Why did I apply to the Digital Storytelling Online Creative Residency?

What motivated me to apply for the Digital Storytelling Festival Online Creative Residency was my interest in growing as a multi-hyphenated media professional and digital storyteller. The residency theme which was grounded in queer history and heritage was especially exciting to explore.

What have I got out of the residency?

During my residency, I chose to focus on revealing hidden stories of resilience, which I chose to explore through three thematic posts. The themes were: queer slang, gender nonconformity across European history, and impactful queer cultural figures. A writer at heart, I challenged myself by condensing complex ideas and translating them into accessible and compelling visual content, drawing from the Europeana archive and personal research. I find Instagram particularly conducive to that, thanks to its carousel post feature.

Where might I go from here?

I'd be keen to develop these posts into longer articles providing more context, as a guide for those curious about the stories referenced.

Discover the history of being LGBTQ+ in Belarus and Eastern Europe through Volha Kavalchuk's contribution to the Europeana Digital Storytelling Festival's Creative Online Residency.

In May-June 2023, eight participants took part in the first ever Online Creative Residency from Europeana’s Digital Storytelling Festival. They worked with mentors in animation, social media stories and new writing relating to LGBTQ+ culture and communities. Volha Kavalchuk uses Instagram reels to share her research of LGBTQ+ histories of Belarus and Eastern Europe. Explore her posts and find out more about Volha below.

A post shared by Europeana (@europeana_eu)

Who am I?

My name is Volha Kavalchuk, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Social Sciences in Communication Studies and Information Management Technologies in Lithuania. I spent the first 19 years of my life in Belarus before moving to a neighboring country. I received a high school education with a focus on history and social studies and decided to continue on this path. My interests lie in various areas concerning society and social sciences, such as history, technology and communication, politics, and the intersection of human rights with these fields.

Why did I apply to the Digital Storytelling Online Creative Residency?

I saw the advertisement for the Digital Storytelling Festival on Instagram Stories. I thought that it would be an excellent opportunity to sharpen my skills in content planning and creation and expand my creative potential in the frame of a certain topic and place. Moreover, it was useful to interact with the professionals from your field. It is difficult to focus on your project on your own, and it seemed nice to me to have such support.

What have I got out of the residency?

Considering my fields of interest, study path, and country of origin, it is pretty logical that I focused on the topic concerning the LGBTQ+ history of Eastern Europe. I tried to focus on Belarus more though the history of countries in my region is interconnected. As some countries are authoritarian right now, the archives regarding this topic especially are not wildly available. There is an academic discourse on the topic of homosexuality and other queer identities in Eastern Europe, especially in the 20th century though this is not wildly spread to the public, especially in English. I would like to clear up the specificities of queer history of my region for queer people and allies from the West part of Europe. Actually, I discovered a lot myself, looking at the usually hidden parts of history I was studying at school.

Where might I go from here?

I am planning to continue with these series and explore different formats of content for Instagram exploring the more recent history of laws and persecution of non-heterosexual people. What's more, a new administrative law article is implemented in my home country against 'propaganda of non-traditional relationships' and I think it is important to talk about this topic with external audiences.

Who am I?

My name is Aida, and I am a student and an aspiring audiovisual artist. I have a unique background as both Greek and Syrian, which has shaped my perspective and fueled my need to rediscover my cultural heritage.

Why did I apply to the Digital Storytelling Online Creative Residency?

When I applied for the residency, my primary goal was to connect with creative individuals and embark on a collective journey of growth and learning. I sought guidance and support to expand my artistic skills and knowledge.

What have I got out of the residency?

To my delight, the residency surpassed my expectations, becoming an incredibly significant and fulfilling experience. During this residency, I had the wonderful opportunity to create a cultural token of Queer Heritage. Though it may be small and imperfect, it holds the power to convey my personal narrative and serves as a significant milestone in the acknowledgement of an inner need for belonging to a queer culture. It was during this time that I truly sensed the significance of Queer Heritage. The gratitude I feel for the chance to explore and create within the nurturing environment provided by the residency is immeasurable. This transformative experience has profoundly enriched my artistic practice, enabling me to embrace and celebrate my diverse background with pride and joy.

I participated in the animation residency of Europeana, where my project centres around the exploration of Toulouse Lautrec's posters featuring Jane Avril and the vibrant cabaret scene of that era. Using the resources of Europeana's extensive archive, I found creativity in the concept of transtextuality and delved into the queer life of the people of  the cabaret scene. I read papers, articles, blogs and at the same time I slowly crafted my animated GIFs.

My GIFs are not amazing works of art, but they are my land, they are my time and space. They are performed within a period of time, in my exhausting, mortal state of mind and my limited resources. And they are quite personal. I wish to have breakfast in the morning with a queer lover, fall in love and feel scared for taking the risk, or perform a sexy, fun, intricate dance.

Where might I go from here?

As for the future of my project, I intend to continue exploring and expanding upon these themes and concepts. I am eager to further examine the nuances of the 'male gaze' and transtextuality within art and culture. Additionally, I am open to the possibility of branching out into other artistic endeavours that allow me to explore in childlike wonder and love.

They worked with mentors in animation, social media stories and new writing relating to LGBTQ+ culture and communities. Marina Schilke animated Peter Behrens 'The Kiss'. Enjoy her animation and find out more about Marina below.

[Love is love kiss sticker GIF]by Marina Schilke, 2023. Based on'Der Kuss'by Peter Behrens, National Museum in Warsaw, public domain.

Who am I?

My name's Marina and I'm from Frankfurt, Germany. Growing up with a Japanese mother and German father my interest in different cultures and perspectives was strengthened and encouraged from an early age.

I recently completed my masters in empirical cultural studies in Germany and my masters in museum studies via distance learning in the UK. Currently I am starting a traineeship in a museum. Interested in everything digital (web,VR, AR, social media) my focus will be on digital projects in exhibitions and mediation.

Why did I apply to the Digital Storytelling Online Creative Residency?

The residency combined my desire to learn something new about storytelling and my interest in digital mediation. The animation course gave me an insight into Adobe fresco and the opportunity to learn from an animation specialist on a 1:1 basis. As a beginner, the ambition to create various storylines motivated me, but my big dreams of creating numerous stories was slowed down a bit by my lack of experience. I found the whole digital residency pretty wholesome and was happy to meet other motivated people.

What have I got out of the residency?

I applied specifically for the animation course, as I was interested in learning something visual and dynamic. Animations can be used in various ways by adding onto social media campaigns, educational content or as entertainment. It was very fun to comb through the Europeana collections and objects.

I choose to incorporate the colours of the (progress) pride flag and reinterpret the existing objects and pictures. Besides my search for rainbows and different colourful displays, I looked at public displays of affection and pride. You can find some highlights of my search in my galleryColourful display of affection.

Many stories were waiting to be told, such as my chosen object 'Der Kuss' (The Kiss) from Peter Behrens. The original has pretty moderate colours and radiates a calm and intimate energy. My interpretation was made to celebrate the love between people of all genders and used a colourful visualisation of the feelings.

Where might I go from here?

I will surely participate in the Europeana GIF IT UP competition and try to develop my skills further.

The history of a sport that has survived centuries

Characterised by dynamism and speed, oina, Romania’s national sport, is a complex sports game that perfectly combines running and jumping with thinking.

The beginnings of this game are lost in the mists of time. Shepherding has been one of the basic occupations of the Romanian people for centuries. Oina was created by shepherds who, in the solitude of the mountains, invented this beautiful game, eager to spend their rest time practising a game that reminded them of their occupation.

So, having its origins in the Romanian villages, this old game was passed down from generation to generation. It constantly evolved, played in different ways and with various names in different areas of Romania.

Initially, the ball was made from cow hair, which was wet and shaped by hand. Then it began to be tied up or braided with string. Later, the ball was made of patches of skin, filled with hair - which is how it is made today.

It was not until the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century that the first official game regulations appeared, drawn up and printed under the auspices of the Ministry of Education and applied uniformly throughout the country.

Spiru Haret was the Minister of Education between 1897 and 1910. He reformed the modern Romanian education system, and instituted annual school oina competitions in 1898, which led to the sport becoming popular.

Between 1920 and 1932, oina experienced rapid progress, becoming more popular than sports of foreign origin. In 1944 and 1945, it was left without subsidies. It was materially supported again, from 1949, when a real revolution of the game took place: competitions were resumed, the foundations of the coaching, referees and instructors’ schools were laid and the rules of the game were changed.

Since the 1990s, oina has suffered a severe decline.

Clubs were disbanded or reorganised, and the sport was only played in a few
centres, due to lack of money, fame, media exposure and other factors. As it was not considered to be a profitable short and medium term investment, and a local sport without regular external trips and international networks, no sponsors were found.

Since July 3 2014, oina has become Romania's national sport. A national program - 'Rediscover oina' - was launched, to promote a niche sport that has not disappeared due to the tenacity of some people.

The Romanian Oina Federation is currently responsible for promoting this game. At present, there are five county oina associations and 32 clubs: 12 of them in urban areas and 20 in rural areas.

Due to its technicalities and to the appropriate training methods used, oina has become a modern game, which can compete with any of the sports practised today.

Oina is a sport in which the players of a team play differently in one half of the game than they do in the second half. In one half, a team is 'pitching' and, in the second half, the same team is 'catching'.

When the team is 'pitching', the main goal is to get as many extra points from hitting the ball with the stick and to pass as many untouched teammates as possible. The 'catching' team has the mission to prevent the opponent from getting points, catching any flying ball that comes into the field, and hitting as many opponents as possible.

Despite the fact that they seem quite similar (and some would say that they have common origins), oina and American baseball are different in terms of regulations, number of players, equipment, size of the field and many others. Oina is also similar to sports in other countries, such asSchlagballin Germany,jeu de paumein France, orpesäpalloin Finland.

Oina is a sport which has been preserved over centuries for a number of reasons. The expenses generated by its practice are minimal. In addition, the game is accessible to players young and old. And last but not least, the game has survived because of people's passion for the sport, their customs and traditions.

--------------------------------------------------

Sifnos, an island in the Cycladic archipelago of the Aegean sea, has for centuries been synonymous with the region’s pottery production. It had high-quality clay, which allowed for the creation of heat-proof cookware; plenty of sunny weather, which expedited the drying process; and ample trees and brush used as kindling for the island’s wood-fired kilns. These favourable conditions catalyzed the prodigious production and progressive evolution of unique everyday objects and techniques since the early 18th century. Today, the practice of pottery making continues, with over fifteen active workshops distributed throughout the island’s sheltered bays and inland villages.

Even now that I am old, I’m always learning. You're always learning. No, it doesn't stop. And you should never say that you know it all. You have to say: I don't know.

Giannis Lembesis

Each pottery workshop is a repository of knowledge, encoded in the form of objects, photographs and stories. Upon the encouragement of local community members seeking to start a pottery museum on the island, the Archipelago Network team began a research and documentation project seeking to co-develop materials for inclusion in the museum-to-be, in collaboration with the Sifnos Potters’ Union. These materials now include hundreds of digitized photographs and documents, a series of thirteen short films about each of the active workshops on the island, and two interdisciplinary research projects.

My father made a crooked pot and he said "Leave it like that, don't throw it away." The first one a customer bought was the crooked one, not the straight one. I've been doing this job ever since. And just imagine… there are more crooked ones than straight ones.

Giorgos Exylzes

The resulting thirteen films, of which four are presented here, speak to the forms of technical and symbolic knowledge embodied in an equal number of workshops. From techniques for digging and mixing soil to social aspects of the craft, including culinary, musical and religious traditions, the interviews conducted speak to the rich history and interconnected present of pottery with Sifnos’s social and economic fabric.

For me, tradition is not something specific; it is completely subjective. Where do you draw the line? Where does tradition begin? What I can say for sure, is that at the moment I'm not making traditional ceramics. And I'm happy with that.

Antonis K. Kalogirou

The threads of these various conversations build into a powerful yet delicate chorus. Pressured by regional economic shifts unfavorable to small-scale, artisanal production and displaced by an increasingly tourism-based service economy, traditional pottery on the island faces an uncertain future. But as Antonis Atsonios, a fourth generation potter in the village of Vathi reminds me, pottery has existed in the Aegean since antiquity, and has weathered many a transition since.

I think there is a future for this. There’s a future in pottery in general. Crafts don’t fade away that easily.

Antonis Atsonios

From futuristic designs to unisex fashion

The 1960s were a time of innovation and exploration. While science ventured into space with a series of missions culminating, in 1969, with the Apollo 11 touching ground on the Moon, fashion foresaw a broad cosmic future, experimenting with new technologies and fabrics, and introducing unisex silhouettes.

Predicting women's fashion in the year 2000, the ‘Space Age’ designers Pierre Cardin, André Courrèges, Paco Rabanne and Rudi Gernreich designed sleek, colour neutral silhouettes in plastic materials, accessorised with vinyl boots, helmets and plastic goggles. Though contemporary history shows that their prediction might not have been that accurate, their creations influenced fashion for the decades ahead.

While the 'Space Age' is considered to start with the launch into space of Sputnik in 1957, the first artificial Earth satellite, the 'fashion Space Age' instead is a trend that originated on the Parisian catwalks in the early-1960s.

During this time, Italian-born fashion designer Pierre Cardin and French André Courrèges, off from their careers in French couture houses, decided to launch their futuristic lines. Alongside them, Paco Rabanne and Rudy Gernreich contributed to the construction of a defined imagery both with their fashion and costume designs, that include the iconic creations for 'Barbarella' (1968) by Rabanne and, later, 'Space: 1999' (1975-1977) by Gernreich.

Inspired by the youthful wave that defined those years, these designers focused on the exploration of the new potentialities of dress, moving away from the past to look forward to a romanticised future.

In 1963, the ‘Cosmocorps’ collection by Pierre Cardin introduced new shapes and geometries, adopting in some cases the same cuts, colours and fabrics for the creations for both men and women. Similarly, since 1961, André Courrèges had infused in his modern collections a sense of gender neutrality, drawing elements from children's clothes.

In addition, their shared characteristic of experimenting with new materials let their creations free of historical gender associations, paving the way to unisex fashion, which would take the fashion world by storm from the following decade.

Conversations with Grandma and the cultural significance of Italy's queer archives

Italian archives

Questions to answer

Challenges to address

A future of collaboration

About the author

Yasmine Ba's 'Conversations with Grandma and the cultural significance of Italy's queer archives', created for Europeana's Digital Storytelling Festival Creative Online Residency.

In May-June 2023, eight participants took part in the first ever Online Creative Residency from Europeana’s Digital Storytelling Festival. They worked with mentors in animation, social media stories and new writing relating to LGBTQ+ culture and communities. Yasmine Ba chose to explore the emergence of queer archives in Italy. Read her story and find out more about Yasmine below.

As I sat with my Italian grandmother in her cozy kitchen, sipping espresso and engaging in our usual lively discussions, the topic of queer people in Italy came up. Despite her liberal mindset, she confessed her lack of knowledge regarding this important aspect of Italian history. As I believe that our understanding of our country’s history is mostly shaped by the archival material available to us, this conversation sparked my curiosity about the presence and significance of queer archives in Italy, where the hidden stories of the LGBTQ+ community are preserved, discredited and/or celebrated.

As a starting point, I try to highlight some interesting initiatives regarding Italy's queer archives, unearthing the cultural importance they hold in shaping our understanding of LGBTQ+ experiences.

Italy has a vibrant queer community that has faced marginalisation and neglect throughout history, especially when it comes to second-generation migrants. While queer people gained similar rights to their counterparts in other Western European countries, being a member of the LGBTQ+ community in Italy is undeniably challenging as there is a strong and persistent cultural taboo in regard to queerness.

The emergence of queer archives in Italy has begun to rectify the lack of dialogue surrounding the visualisation of queer people’s history and past in this country. These repositories of knowledge provide a counterbalance to mainstream narratives, elevating the diverse stories and struggles of the LGBTQ+ community. By preserving the cultural, social and political history of queer individuals in Italy, these archives challenge societal norms while fostering acceptance and inclusivity.

In my quest to unearth archival material related to queer people in Italy, I encountered several notable initiatives dedicated to collecting, cataloging and preserving queer materials and artefacts. TheArchivio di Stato di Firenze, nestled in the heart of Florence, houses a specialized LGBTQ+ archive that chronicles the history of the queer community in Tuscany. It is here that we discover the ’Rivolta Trans’ newspaper, a publication from the 1970s that served as a vital platform for the emerging transgender community. This historical artefact provides a glimpse into the activism, resilience and aspirations of Italian transgender individuals during a crucial period of societal change.

In the fascinating realm of archival endeavours, one project also stands out as groundbreaking in contemporary Italy - the ArchiviST* project, an initiative that aims to create the first-ever archive dedicated exclusively to the history of trans lives and activism in the country. Spearheaded by theTrans Identity Movement, Italy's most influential and enduring trans association since its inception in 1979, the project embarks on the task of documenting and preserving the counter-memories of trans and LGBTQIA+ communities, marking a significant milestone in the country's historical landscape.

As they delve into the process of ’reconstructing’ an archive in this unique context, a tapestry of questions unfolds, provoking contemplation and exploration of the intricate dynamics surrounding trans archiving and collective memories within the Italian framework.

At the heart of the ArchiviST*’s reflective journey lies an interrogation of what constitutes collective memory. The interplay between trans memories and the archive's tangible documents comes under scrutiny, as they ponder the stories that have been told - or, perhaps more importantly, the stories that have been omitted. Whose voices and experiences emerge as protagonists in this archival tapestry, and whose remain obscured?

Through a reflexive lens, the ArchiviST* invites critical engagement with the practice of trans archiving, aiming to disrupt established historiographical categories and conventions. Conventional notions of time, the delineation between private and public, the complexities of political engagement, the intertwinement of life history and memory - all these facets present ethical and methodological challenges that demand our attention and reflection, reshaping the landscape of historiography and archival research at large.

By showcasing the rich tapestry of queer experiences throughout Italian history, these initiatives dismantle the fallacy that queerness is antithetical to Italian identity, particularly within the realm of masculinity and the standards upheld by Italian men. Popular culture, including cinema, has often perpetuated a narrow definition of Italian masculinity, exemplified by actors like Giuliano Gemma, whose rugged and stoic portrayals became the archetype of the macho Italian hero.

But, these archives reveal a more nuanced reality, challenging societal expectations and highlighting the presence of queer individuals who defied and reshaped the boundaries of masculinity. Pier Paolo Pasolini, the renowned filmmaker and intellectual, stands as a testament to this, his contributions to Italian cinema and literature defying traditional notions of both gender and sexuality. His unapologetic embrace of his own queerness and intellectual exploration of desire shattered preconceived notions, paving the way for a more inclusive understanding of Italian masculinity and its intersections with queerness. Through these examples, the queer archives illuminate the complexity and diversity of Italian identity, celebrating the contributions of successful gay men who have left an indelible mark on Italian culture.

In a nation where the notion of ’LGBTQ’ has long been absent, the very existence of these archival materials shatters the fallacy that Italian identity and queerness are mutually exclusive. Through the exhibition of artefacts and personal narratives, queer archives defy and interrogate deeply ingrained preconceived notions of sexuality, fostering empathy and understanding across diverse spectrums of society.

Queer archives serve also as invaluable resources for researchers, scholars and students interested in studying and understanding LGBTQ+ history and culture. These repositories facilitate academic inquiry, allowing exploration of themes such as queer activism, art, literature, and social movements. By making historical materials accessible, these institutions foster critical thinking and enrich our understanding of what the LGBTQ+ community looks like in Italy.

But, challenges persist in the realm of queer archives in Italy. Limited funding and the need for digitisation and online accessibility pose ongoing obstacles, as government support for cultural projects promoting queerness in the public space remains limited. Additionally, within the archival materials, one must consider the extent to which the queer community is portrayed in its full potential. Questions arise regarding the inclusion of marginalised groups such as migrants, sex workers and non-white Italians, whose narratives deserve equal representation within the archives.

The context surrounding the presence or absence of queer artefacts in Italy is complex. Unlike countries such as Germany, Holland and France, where queer publications were available until the fall of the Weimar Republic in 1933, Italy remained an exception. A few forgotten magazines briefly aligned with movements challenging homotransphobic laws but underwent ideological transformations under fascism. The advent of fascism and Nazism effectively halted the publication of queer magazines in Italy, rendering thousands of copies unobtainable and making queerness invisible. Post-World War II, queer magazines resurfaced, adopting a scientific-anthropological focus reminiscent of turn-of-the-century journals. However, publications likeCuriosa magazine faced legal troublefor disseminating erotic literature, including homoerotic books that had even been obscured during the fascist era.

The exploration of queer archives in Italy illuminates a rich history that has long been obscured and marginalised. The invaluable efforts of collectors likeLuca Locati Lucianihave brought to light a diverse array of publications, objects and narratives, spanning over a century of queer existence. But, the true potential of these archives lies not only in the artefacts themselves but in the collaborative spirit that can amplify their impact.

Collaboration among different archives across Italy is essential for the comprehensive understanding and appreciation of the queer experience. By sharing knowledge, resources and best practices, these institutions can enhance their individual collections and contribute to a more holistic representation of Italy's queer past. Through collaboration, archives can bridge gaps in their collections, fill in historical narratives and create a more comprehensive and inclusive depiction of the diverse experiences within the LGBTQ+ community.

While it is unfortunate that some archival material or artefacts have been lost, destroyed or intentionally deleted due to societal prejudice or neglect, their absence should not be overlooked. Instead, it becomes imperative to reflect upon their significance and investigate further through conversations with older queer generations. Engaging in dialogue with these individuals can provide valuable insights, oral histories and personal anecdotes that contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the past.

By actively seeking out the perspectives and stories of older queers, the younger generation can bridge the gap between past and present, fostering a deeper appreciation for the struggles and triumphs of those who came before them.

In this quest for understanding, I found myself once again sitting with my Italian grandmother, reminiscing about the past. As the afternoon sun streamed through her kitchen window, casting a warm glow on the worn, wooden table, she began to share an anecdote from her own youth in Florence. She spoke of a small, hidden café tucked away in the narrow streets of the city, a haven for artists, intellectuals, and, as it turned out, the queer community. With a twinkle in her eyes and a nostalgic smile, she recounted the nights she spent there, surrounded by vibrant conversations and laughter, feeling the palpable sense of freedom and acceptance that permeated the air. In that moment, I realised that the significance of queer archives in Italy extended beyond academic inquiry or cultural preservation—it was about connecting generations, embracing our shared history, and honouring the untold stories of those who paved the way for a more inclusive future. As I sat there, listening to my grandmother's words, I couldn't help but feel a profound gratitude for the power of these archives and the role they played in bringing us closer together, bridging the gap between her past and my present. In that small, tender moment, I understood that the journey to uncovering Italy's queer archives was not just a scholarly pursuit, but a personal one—a journey that reaffirmed the timeless bond between grandmother and grandchild, and the importance of preserving our collective heritage for generations to come.

Who am I?

I am Yasmine Ba, a freelance writer and graduate in Political Science with a strong interest in archival practices, and the underlying political and cultural motives behind them. I am also interested in the intersection between visual arts and archives; the use of sound, images, photographs to reminisce about the past.

Why did I apply to the Digital Storytelling Online Creative Residency?

I applied to Europeana’s Online Creative Residency to gain more insights about how to write and cater for a digital audience, and to meet like-minded writers. I’ve learned a lot through the residency, from my peers but especially through the writing mentor Beth Daley, and received valuable tips in regards to finding my voice, choosing suitable visuals, and most importantly, on how to conduct effective and coherent storytelling.

What is my project about?

For this project, I initially wanted to complete a chapter of my upcoming novel. But as I advanced in the process, I realized that I wanted to go in the direction of uncovering queer archives, with the particular choice of Italy because of the country’s knotty relationship to queerness, and the lack of understanding. The next step would be to maybe translate this text in Italian, and make a zine out of it, in collaboration with Italian queer archivists!

S for Saskia, in Silence = Death

Read Tonya Atanakova's fictional story exploring LGBTQ+ cultures and communities, created for Europeana's Digital Storytelling Festival Creative Online Residency.

In May-June 2023, eight participants took part in the first ever Online Creative Residency from Europeana’s Digital Storytelling Festival. They worked with mentors in animation, social media stories and new writing relating to LGBTQ+ culture and communities. Tonya Atanakova's fictional story 'S for Saskia, in Silence = Death', is inspired bya gallery she createdfrom Europeana collections. Read her story and find out more about Tonya below.

May 19th, 1983, Thursday

The morning sun sneaks through the curtains and casts a warm light on my bed. As I try to wake up, Tommy’s purring reaches my ears. He is lying behind me on the bed, a ginger ball of fur. I stretch out to pet him and he promptly stretches out in contentment. I don’t like getting up in the morning, but I love the tranquillity of the early hours. My thoughts wander freely, without the momentum of the previous days and the protests.

In recent weeks, my mind has been constantly in an offensive state. I can’t stand still. There are so many people doing nothing to help or prevent it. This is a crisis. And yet it remains an unspoken topic. None of those who have a voice address it. Or if they do talk, they mock it. That’s why I go out of my way to raise as much awareness and noise as I can.

During my last visit to the clinic, Eddie laughed so hard at my jokes about President Reagan and Flashdance, even though it made him cough uncomfortably. He told me I brighten his day with my stand-up comedy. His laughter brightened mine. Eddie, a black man in his 40s with a strong jawline and vibrant personality, is one of my greatest supporters in my stand-up adventures and serves as the litmus test for any joke I write. It goes through him first before I tell it on stage. Alas, I forgot the coffee on the stove again.

My breakfast passed in these thoughts. I glanced at the pile of posters in the corner of the room. Lying unfinished on the floor, with pink triangles and the slogan "Silence = Death" all over them. I made a mental note to finish them after the stand-up show. The protest is on Saturday, and today is Thursday. I have time. I swiftly get dressed and I check myself in the mirror, a quintessential portrait of a lesbian activist. The tousled shoulder-length tresses, the rings on my fingers, the black leather jacket. Only the blue pin with the pink triangle bearing the words I’m a lady lover was lacking. I put it on too.

I head to the clinic, straight to the HIV/AIDS ward. The patients come alive when I show up because they know I will shower them with my comedic repertoire. But, this time, there’s silence and a noticeable absence. Eddie is nowhere to be seen, his bed occupied by a stranger. My gaze shifts towards Frank in the neighbouring bed. His warm eyes convey what happened. I can’t hold my tears back and Frank extends his hand in solace. I grasp it tightly. I notice that his blond hair seems to have lost its former lustre slightly more. And his pale complexion bears more heavily the weight of his illness it seems. We keep silent for a while.

An hour later, I know that the stranger in Eddie’s bed is called Linda and all the intricacies of her life story. Linda, a transsexual, found the freedom to be herself in New York in 1979. She got diagnosed last year. Linda has a 10-year-old daughter whom she hasn’t had contact with since then. Her mother completely severed all ties after learning about it, proclaiming, “It is contagious, and you shouldn’t see each other anymore.”

As Linda talks about her relationship with her daughter, her gaze is fixated upon some obscure point in the distance. She speaks confidently and her movements are fluid and deliberate. But the guilt weighs heavily on all of her despite her innocence. I hug her and tell her “I am sure you will reunite with her when they find the cure for this.” Linda looks at me tenderly with her long lashes, albeit tinged with a hint of “don’t fool me, girl, I know I am doomed”. I tell her about my little sister and how much I miss her. And why I haven’t seen her since she was 10. And how now she should be 15. “Our parents said it was in the interest of her well-being for her to be shielded from the potential contagion of my homosexuality.” Curious, Linda asks me about my age. “Twenty-one,” I respond; “Oh, Saskia, my dear child,” she exclaims and embraces me.

Many turn their backs on the suffering around them. And yet, it hurts the most when it's your own family. People with HIV/AIDS are more than statistics. They are victims of a society that seeks our erasure and willfully ignores the problem. Because it is thedisease of homosexuals. How convenient. But this crisis does not only affect us. It will become clear in the end that this is a human crisis, not just for our marginalised society.

I filled their ears with my stand-up sketch. I rehearsed my entire repertoire with them a couple of times. I love their laughter.

Who am I?

Hey there, allow me to introduce myself - Tonnie, a creative force with many ideas, fueled by coffee and a passion for putting my imagination in words, or visuals. Hindered by ADHD and time blindness only. And the limits of the human condition.

I ventured into the realm of storytelling first by studying Cinema and Television Arts at New Bulgarian University, where I fell hopelessly in love with long-form media, such as TV and web series, and transmedia storytelling. My professional journey began actually as a Content Marketer. Currently I have found myself in the world of Performance Marketing, which has its daily challenges that I enjoy analysing  and solving. Yet, my true calling never wavers and in every spare moment, my creative spirit is crafting stories and characters.

Sometimes I do photography and I am in the process of developing a web series project based in Southeast Europe as a screenwriter. And when the opportunity arises, I lend my communication and organisational skills to Sofia Meetings, the industry side of the Sofia International Film Festival.

Why did I apply to the Digital Storytelling Online Creative Residency?

I saw storytelling and immediately applied. I hoped participating would give me a clearer path ahead and a streak of inspiration and motivation to persist. And it did all of that for me.

What have I got out of the residency?

A new source of inspiration and purpose to keep telling the  stories that I think should be told. And the motivation to keep up my efforts in what I do.

Storytelling, for me personally, is a balance between inspiration and imagination. For this project, I have drawn inspiration from Europeana collections to create galleries that inspired the characters. Then I let them tell me their stories. The goal is to take the reader on a kaleidoscopic journey through time and explore the complexities of identity and love for LGBTQIA+ people.

One of the most exciting aspects for me is the range of styles I want to try within each story. I have sought to showcase the versatility of short fiction literature as an art form. This format was a decision of mine to challenge me as a writer and also to keep the reader engaged and hopefully excited throughout the entire project, as they discover new voices and perspectives with each new story.

I hope this project inspires you to embrace character-driven storytelling, as well as promote empathy and acceptance, regardless of gender, gender identity or sexual orientation.

Where might I go from here?

Keep your eyes peeled, as this project has just begun and I intend to expand it across as many art mediums as I can, with collaboration. Also, feel free to draw in any kind of inspiration from it for any art medium.

As we move forward with this project, I hope that you will spread the word about the work here to others who might be interested.

Moreover, if anyone would like to collaborate on crafting any of the other stories - follow me on Instagram:@atanakova.

Selma Lagerlöf

Lorraine Hansberry

Paula Gunn Allen

Breaking barriers within literature and the arts

Queer women throughout history have broken barriers and paved the way for women to be recognised as important contributors to arts and literature in their societies. Sometimes it has been at the cost of hiding their own sexual identities and other times by directly vocalising historical erasure of queer identities.

The stories of Selma Lagerlöf, Lorraine Hansberry and Paula Gunn Allen highlight these struggles and achievements within the context of their time and communities.

Selma Lagerlöf was born in Värmland, Kingdom of Sweden and Norway, on 20 November 1858.

From birth she had a hip injury and, at the age of three, fell ill, causing a paralysis of her legs which she later recovered from.

This disability forced me to sit still and look inside myself, and that is why I became a writer. If I had been healthy, I would probably have had to marry some factory manager.

Between 1882 and 1885, Lagerlöf studied at the Högre lärarinneseminariet (the Royal Advanced Female Teachers' Seminary) in Stockholm, Sweden. In 1885, she went on to work as a schoolmistress at a high school for girls in a town in Scania, Sweden called Landskrona. Her debut novel, Gösta Berling's saga (1891), was written there. A male critic gave her positive reviews of the Danish translation which caused her popularity to grow.

She gave up teaching in 1895 to devote herself to writing and by 1909 was the first woman to win a Nobel prize in literature.

Homosexuality was illegal and taboo between women in her time, so Lagerlöf took care to destroy letters written between her and her lovers deemed too risky. A surviving letter between her and her friend Valborg Olander, a teacher, politician and suffragette is suggestive of erotic and physical passion between them.

She also had a relationship with her friend and Swedish writer Sophie Elkan who influenced her work greatly.

Lorraine Hansberry was born in Chicago, Illinois, 19 May 1930.

Notable Black people such as sociology professor W. E. B. Du Bois, poet Langston Hughes, musician Duke Ellington, and Olympic gold medalist Jesse Owens, frequently visited Hansberry's family.

She was interested in writing from an early age and was drawn to theatre in high school. She attended the University of Wisconsin between 1948 and 1950, then briefly the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and Roosevelt University (Chicago).

In 1958, Hansberry raised the funds to produce her playA Raisin in the Sun. It opened in March 1959 at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre on Broadway.A Raisin in the Suntakes a look at the effects of racial prejudice on the dreams of a working class Black family in Chicago.

It won the New York Drama Critics’ Circle Award, and the film version of 1961 received a special award at the Cannes festival.

Hansberry was a closeted lesbian. Before her marriage to Robert Nemiroff, a Jewish publisher, songwriter, and political activist, she had written about her attraction to women in her personal notebooks.

After her separation from Nemiroff, she contributed two letters to the magazine of the Daughters of Bilitis, the first lesbian and civil rights organisation, both of which were published under her initials.

A year before her death from pancreatic cancer, on 1 May 1964, she spoke to the winners of a creative writing conference stating:

Though it is a thrilling and marvelous thing to be merely young and gifted in such times, it is doubly so, doubly dynamic — to be young, gifted and black.

She was the first Black woman to write a play on Broadway and inspired Nina Simone's songTo be Young, Gifted and Black.

Paula Gunn Allen was born on October 24, 1939 in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

Her father was Lebanese American, and her mother was part Laguna-Sioux. Allen identified mostly with the Laguna with whom she spent her childhood and upbringing.

Allen received a BA and MFA in creative writing from the University of Oregon. She wroteThe Sacred Hoop: Recovering the Feminine in American Indian Traditionsin (1986), based on her own experiences and her study of Native American cultures.

Her work tackles the biased western view of Native American societies. Allen described the central role women played in many Native American cultures and political leadership, which were minimised or overlooked by explorers, colonisers and scholars from male-dominated European cultures.

Allen's book and following works have been influential, encouraging other feminist studies of Native American cultures and literature, including an emergence of Indigenous feminism.

After her two divorces, she started to identify as a lesbian. She later described herself as a serial bisexual interested in a person unconcerned 'if it's a male or female body'.

She was also a poet and some of her poetry explore lesbian themes in Native American culture. She was a champion in re-establishing the place of gay and lesbians in Native American communities.

I dreamedOf making love, of needingTo make love ofNot being able to. Of touching your faceIn awe, of seeing the rose of life on it,Your skin a matin in a moister place (...)

Paradigm, Paula Gunn Allen

Gay artist and author who fought in the Dutch Resistance during World War II

Willem Arondéus was a Dutch artist and author who joined the Dutch anti-Nazi resistance movement during World War II. In a time of great prejudice and danger, Arondeus was openly and defiantly gay.

He was born in Naarden in August 1894. Soon afterwards, his family moved to Amsterdam, where he trained at an art school. After finishing his education, he moved to a number of cities in the Netherlands as well as Paris.

In 1923, he was commissioned to paint a large mural for Rotterdam City Hall. In the early 1930s, he produced nine tapestries with the coat of arms of various Dutch munipicalities which still hang in Villa Welgelegen, an official building in Haarlem.

He was commissioned to illustrate poetry books, as well as to designing posters and calendars.

In 1938, he published two novels,Het Uilenhuis('The Owls House') andIn de bloeiende Ramenas('In the Blossoming Winter Radish'), which were both illustrated with his own designs.

When Nazi Germany occupied the Netherlands during World War II, Arondéus became a member of the Dutch resistance movement. He used his artistic skills to forge false identity papers and other documents to help people escape persecution.

However, soon the German forces began to compare the forgeries with population registers - which showed they had been faked.

In an attempt to hinder this, Arondeus and others planned a bomb attack on the population registery office in Amsterdam. Disguised as a policeman, he entered the building on 27 March 1943 with a group of resistance fighters. The explosion destroyed 800,000 identity cards, which was around 15% of the total.

While all of the bombers escaped on the night, Arondéus was arrested a few days later. In June 1943, he was tried and sentenced to death, along with 13 other men who had taken part.

Willem Arondéus was executed on July 1, 1943. Just before he was executed, Arondéus made a point of asking his lawyer to make sure the public knew that he (and two other men in the group) were gay: 'Tell people that homosexuals are not cowards'.

From 1932 to 1941, Arondéus had a relationship with Gerrit Jan Tijssen, a greengrocer from Apeldoorn. They lived together in Apeldoorn and later in Amsterdam. In 1941, Tijssen returned to Apeldoorn because Arondéus's resistance activities made it too dangerous to stay together in Amsterdam. They never met again.

Today, Willem Arondeus is remembered with plaques and a number of streets in Dutch cities named after him.

He, and the others who took part in the raid on the population registery, were awarded the Resistance Memorial Cross in 1984, some 40 years after the war had ended. It is speculated that this delay in recognising him was due to his sexuality.

In 1986, he was awarded the Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem, Israel's official memorial to the victims of the Holocaust.

In 2023, Arondéus was a character inA Small Light, a biographical World War II television drama miniseries and his story was featured in a documentaryWillem and Frida - Defying Nazisby Stephen Fry.

A place of history, transmission and contemporary creation

La Borne is a village of ceramists in the centre of France, a few kilometres from the town of Bourges. The village is home to around a hundred craftsmen, sculptors and ceramists, whose 'boutiques' - that's what the workshops are called - are located in and around the village.

The earliest evidence of pottery-making at La Borne dates from the XIIIᵉ century. Techniques for firing local clay developed from the XVᵉ century onwards, and La Borne enjoyed a major period of prosperity in the XIXᵉ century. Ceramic production was mainly utilitarian at the time and was sold in central and western France.

Important figures in ceramics were working at La Borne at the time, such as Marie Talbot (1814-1874), who came from a family of potters, and whose creations were singular and signed. She depicted popular images and culture, particularly women. She played an important role in the development of La Borne.

In the 20th century, traditional ceramics went into decline. It faced competition from other materials and changing tastes at the time. Unlike other ceramic villages in France, La Borne underwent a transformation with the arrival of artists who came to learn the traditional skills and techniques of the village's craftsmen. It was a time when certain visual artists were making ceramics part of their art.

The work of Jacqueline (1920-2009) et Jean (1913-1992) Lerat reflect the revival of ceramics at the time. Set up in 1943 at La Borne, their first pieces were functional, but their work then moved towards an artistic approach.

From then on, La Borne acquired an international reputation. It welcomed professionals of all nationalities, artists and craftsmen from all over the world. Since 1971, the Association Céramique La Borne has been bringing together artists and craftspeople and bringing life to the village by organising events and exhibitions.

In 2010, the Centre Céramique Contemporaine de La Borne was created in partnership with the Ceramists' Association and the Communauté de Communes des Hautes terres en Haut Berry. The centre is both an exhibition and sales venue and also a place for teaching ceramics, thanks to the ceramics workshops offered to all kinds of audiences.

A journey to La Borne: exhibiting the work of artists and craftsmen at the Contemporary Ceramics Centre

Organised by the Association Céramique La Borne and the Centre Céramique Contemporaine la Borne, Les Grands Feux de la Borne is an annual event featuring large-scale firings in several of the village's kilns.

It is an important moment in the life of the village of la Borne, a time for celebration and a chance for the public to meet the artisans. Exhibitions, conferences and practical workshops are also organised to showcase the work of the artisans.
The public can watch the clay being fired in the artisans' workshops, which are open for the occasion. It's also a time for exhibiting and selling the craftsmen's work.

A journey to La Borne: mastering and transmitting traditional know-how

Firing is an important part of the creative process. The kilns are traditionally wood-fired and come in all shapes and sizes. They can be fired continuously for several days during the major firings and give the ceramics their final appearance and variations in colour. Above all, it makes the clay watertight.

Unlike the La Borne contemporary ceramics centre, whose role is to exhibit the work of current artists and craftsmen from La Borne, the Musée de la Borne is dedicated to preserving the pottery and ceramics heritage. The pieces in its collection are ancient. The museum is located in the old Chapelle St-Jean-Baptiste, an original, bright space for exhibitions.

A journey to La Borne: preserving treasures from the past

The important collection of historical pieces, such as those belonging to the Talbot family, has been merged with the collection of artworks by Vassil Ivanoff.
Considered "the first ceramic expressionist", Vassil Ivanoff is a major ceramics artist who played a part in the revival of the Borne in the second half of the 20th century. The collection, which began in the 1980s, has been enriched by 20th-century pieces.

From April until 12 November 2023, the museum is presenting the exhibition "Le sacré et l'intime" ("The sacred and the intimate").

The exhibition presents never-before-exhibited works by several major artists from the 19th century to the present day. These artists have all, in their own way, explored the religious, the sacred or the spiritual in their work.

La Borne is a place out of time, where tradition meets a profoundly modern approach to art and craftsmanship. However, the village of La Borne is not an open-air museum: The village is above all the home of artists and craftspeople.

Drawing inspiration from B-movies and science fiction,The Rocky Horror Showis now an internationally recognised cult musical, both as a stage show and film.

The Rocky Horror Showwas first performed in June 1973, debuting at theRoyal Court Theatrein London.

The musical was written by actor Richard O'Brien to pay homage to B-movies, science fiction and horror films from the 1930s to the 1960s.

With music and visuals inspired by glam rock, it tells the story of a newly engaged couple getting caught in a storm and coming to the home of scientist, Dr Frank-N-Furter, who unveils his new creation, Rocky, a monster in the form of a tanned, blonde muscular man.

The Rocky Horror Show was influenced by, and also an influence on, counter-cultural and sexual liberation movements that followed in the 1970s and 1980s. It was one of the first musicals to depict characters who were liberated and had fluid sexualities.

As such, it has become beloved within LGBTQ+ communities and is celebrated for its subversive portrayal of sexuality and gender.

From its first production at the Royal Court, in 1973,The Rocky Horror Showmoved to othercinemas and theatresin London. Its popularity soon grew, with productions being staged around the world in the following years.

By the 1980s, it had been performed across Europe, with productions in Copenhagen, Madrid, Paris, the Netherlands, Barcelona, Oslo and Ghent.The Rocky Horror Showalso went beyond Europe, with shows in Japan, Mexico, Brazil, Canada, Australia and more.

In 1975,The Rocky Horror Picture Show- a movie version of the musical - was released. It was filmed in the United Kingdom, with some scenes shot atOakley Court, a country house in Berkshire.

The film was initially reviewed negatively, but it found a loving audience who regularly attended screenings and productions, often dressed as characters.

This interactivity, where fans can have an active role in celebratingRocky Horrorhelps to explain its long-running appeal over 50 years.

TodayThe Rocky Horror Show- both the musical and film - are cult classics, still performed and screened around the world. It is celebrated as a queer artform as it highlights gender fluidity and non-conformity, by diverse audiences who love its camp and catchy songs.

Mother and daughter or master and apprentice? A brief history of women and crafts

Crafts are part of every culture across the world and are affected by the cultural values of their community. The relationship between men and crafts has historically been different to the relationship between women and crafts, with expectations, rules of behaviour, and even laws and regulations varying according to gender. For example, in some places and time periods, married women were not allowed to open craft workshops in their own names, but could work within the family business. In the 18th and 19th centuries in Europe, it was not uncommon for women to supervise and administer the family business during the men's prolonged absences.

During the 19th century, the notion of ’separate spheres’ between male and female life became more rigid in the bourgeois classes. Women saw themselves more relegated to productive activities linked to domestic life. The Industrial Revolution spurred on the development of a large workforce of women and children from the working class. This reduced the number of traditional artisanal workshops and impacted the employment of women.

Between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, however, Europe and the USA witnessed a flourishing of philanthropic initiatives linked to the redemption of disadvantaged women relegated to domestic servitude. Schools and workshops were opened, especially for bobbin lace, lace and embroidery crafts. The work of these women can be thought of as artisanal (manual and creative), but the structure that supports it derives from American philanthropic entrepreneurship and has nothing to do with the artisan workshops of medieval origin.

Female craft work often took place at home and was handed down from mother to daughter, with no age limits other than those related to health. Technological advancements like the invention of eyeglasses and pedal sewing machines presented real revolutions in the working lives of women.

It was common, when the culture and the climate permitted it, for women to gather in small groups to work together. In this way, they passed knowledge from one generation to another and took advantage of the opportunity to form cooperative social groups.

With the development of technical tools to support crafts (such as the sewing machine), the traditional relationship between ’master’ and apprentice - or mother and daughter - in small home repair and tailoring workshops - was enriched. Vocational schools were created, usually strictly divided by gender.

Some handicrafts in which men appear to dominate actually derive from domestic productions managed by women. This is the case with beer - in the Middle Ages, women could sell it only when they had produced more than could be used by the family. Married women could trade it only together with their husbands, while widows and unmarried women were allowed to both produce and trade it.

Looking at the history of women's craftsmanship between the sixties and today we see very different phenomena. In the Global South higher female education has led to a progressive abandonment of traditional craftsmanship, which had often remained alive especially in rural areas or in families strongly linked to traditional values. In Europe and the USA, on the contrary, there have been moments of strong "idealisation" of artisanal work as a protest movement against the consumer society and the capitalist system. From hippies to eco-warriors to cottagecore aesthetic lovers, craftsmanship has been practised with mixed results and very variable duration. Women, even in these cases, have often been able to cooperate in order to create small craft companies with attached workshops that were successful.

Modern-day artisans are increasingly finding an audience online, where portals like Etsy allow anyone to advertise and share their handmade work. Niche crafts and art styles can still find an audience in this way, leading to a re-flourishing of artisan production and marketing.

Friedrich Haase - book-lover, philologist and letter-writer

Siegfried Brie - law expert, newspaper editor and rector

Otto Lummer - specialist in radiation

Alfred Hillebrandt - linguist and mythologist

Professors and scientists at one of the oldest universities in Central Europe

The University of Wrocław, Poland, was founded in 1702, making it one of the oldest universities in Central Europe. Let’s discover some of the professors and scientists who have helped establish the University’s reputation as a leader of research, science and technology.

Who are they and why are they important?

Friedrich Gottlob Heinrich Christian Haase was a classical philologist and expert in rhetoric. The law and its history were the subject of interest for Siegfried Brie. The only representative of exact sciences in this group is the physicist Otto Richard Lummer, known for his achievements in the field of optics and thermal radiation. Alfred Hillebrandt was an Orientalist specialising in the language, culture and history of ancient India.

First of all, let’s meet Friedrich Gottlob Heinrich Christian Haase. Haase was born in Magdeburg in 1808. He studied classical philology at the Universities of Halle andGreifswald. In 1838, he defended his doctoral dissertation at theUniversity of Halle. He worked at the University of Wrocław from 1840, where he was a full professor in philology from 1846, and in rhetoric from 1851. Between 1858 and1859, he was the university's rector.

From an early age, Haase was interested in and collected books. At the end of his life, he had a collection of over 7,000 titles. There were about 40 manuscripts among them. Several of them found their way to the University Library in Wrocław, including the 12th-century Arator’s codex containing hisHistoria apostolicaor the Greek liturgical manuscript from the 17th century.

Haase’s correspondents were mainly representatives of the broadly understood science of antiquity. Among them were his two university teachers, outstanding classical philologists of the first half of the 19th century -August Böckh, the publisher of, among others, Pindar’s works andKarl Lachmann, the founder of contemporary text criticism.

In Haase's correspondence, one can find not only letters of scholars. For example, he exchanged letters with a well-known social activist and thinker,Ferdinand Lassalle, considered one of the founders of social democracy. In 1863, Lassalle founded theGeneral German Workers' Association, the first workers’ party in history.

Siegfied Brie was born on 21 January 1838 inHamburg. He came from a merchant family of Jewish origin, which had converted to Protestantism.

He studied law inHeidelberg,LeipzigandBerlin, where he gained a doctorate in 1861. Then he worked as an editor for the newspaper Berliner Allgemeine Zeitung. From 1866 onwards, he taught law in Heidelberg and obtained his habilitation (the highest university degree in many European countries) in 1869. From 1874 to 1878, he was a Professor of Law inRostockand later inWrocławuntil 1921, when he retired.

During the last stage of his career, he edited a series of research works on law: Abhandlungen aus dem Staats- und Verwaltungsrecht, and also served as rector of theUniversity of Wrocławin the academic year 1890-1891. He died on 3 December 1931 in Wrocław.

Wrocław University Library currently holds 209 letters addressed to Siegfried Brie. There are letters from important authors including Georg Bender, who was the mayor of Breslau from 1891 to 1912 (shelf-marks: Brie 8-10).

Otto von Gierkewas a  famous German legal historian (shelf-marks: Brie 84-86).

Eduard Nordenwas a world-renowned classical philologist (shelf-mark: Brie 146).

Otto Richard Lummer’s (1860-1925) research interests focused primarily on optics and black body radiation.

He was born in Thuringia, in the city ofGera(Polish: Góra), and studied at several German universities, until he ultimately became an assistant to professorHermann von Helmholtzat thePhysikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt in Berlin.He took the position of professor there in 1894, and, from 1904 until his death, he worked at theSchlesische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität zu Breslau, where he was the director of the Institute of Physics for many years.

Professor Lummer discovered the phenomenon of interference occurring in a long, flat-parallel glass plate with a bevelled end. His invention was perfected by another German physicist,Ernst Gehrcke, and therefore today it is called the Lummer-Gehrecke plate. This instrument is used in interferometer, spectrography and interference spectroscopy. In the field of optics, Lummer is also known as the co-creator of the photometric cube, which he invented withEugen Brodhun.

In 1895, in collaboration withWilhelm Wien, Lummer created the first black body model, which consisted of a blackened, opaque, hollow sphere with a small outlet recess, the walls of which were uniformly heated. Then, in 1899, Otto Lummer andErnst Pringsheim Sr. conducted groundbreaking research into the distribution of energy in the black body spectrum, which ledMax Planckto formulate thequantum hypothesis.
It is worth adding that Lummer also developed a mercury lamp for producing monochromatic light, and in 1902 he built a high-resolution spectroscope.

Otto Lummer also initiated the creation of the first radio station in Wrocław: Schlesische Funkstunde.

Among the senders of letters written to Lummer, there are many world-famous scholars. These include Nobel Prize winners, well as other well-known professors of the University of Wrocław, such asMax Born,Philipp LenardandFritz Haber. All three were known for their research in the field of quantum mechanics.

Among this group, it is also worth mentioning the physicistGustav Robert Kirchhoff, who worked at the University of Wrocław from  1850 to1854, the discoverer of anode radiationEugen Goldstein, the chemistAlfred Stock, and the zoologistWilly Kükenthal, who specialised in research on corals and was the Rector of the University of Wrocław between1911 and 1912.Ernst Mach, an Austrian physicist known primarily for the airspeed unit named after him, also wrote to Lummer.

Alfred Hillebrandt (1853-1927) was born in Silesia, and studied comparative linguistics and Sanskrit at theUniversity of Wrocław, under the guidance of Adolf Friedrich Stenzler, one of the great pioneers of indology. Afterwards, he continued his studies for a few years in Munich. Having earned his PhD, he came back to his alma mater, where he obtained a professorship of Sanskrit and was twice Rector. He stayed there until his retirement in 1921.

Professor Hillebrandt bequeathed his collection of Sanskrit manuscripts to the University of Wrocław, where they are still preserved.

He was well-versed in all aspects of ancient India, but his great specialty was the Veda and its mythology. His research is so outstanding that it is still read today by scholars, more than a century after it was published.

Therefore, it is not surprising to find amongst his correspondents the greatest western indologists of his time. Eugen Hultzsch was known for deciphering the inscriptions of Ashoka. Arthur Macdonell was the author of classical Vedic textbooks. Ernst Windisch was an indologist, who was also known for his work on Celtic cultures. We also find letters from scholars from India, including Rudrapatta Schamasastry, the discoverer of the Arthashastra, Keshavlav Harshad Dhruv, a prominent specialist of Middle and Old Gujarati, or Vishnu Sitaram Sukthankar, the famous editor of the Mahabharata.

Considering a post-war travelling exhibition of rural handicrafts

In this guest blog, Jennifer Lewis introduces a travelling exhibition of British rural crafts which featured the work of her grandfather, David Lewis.

The year is 1947. World War II is finally over. A travelling exhibition crosses the world. Sponsored by the British Council, the exhibition is timely and ambitious, its purpose being to represent some of the best of Britain’s rural culture to former colonies in the Southern Hemisphere. Projects like this were part of the cultural diplomacy work of the Council.

I became interested in the exhibition because it included ten objects crafted by my grandfather, and because it travelled around Australia and New Zealand, countries I've come to know well.

David Lewis (1892-1961) was a rural labourer who, apart for some months in the Army, lived his entire life in a farming community in West Wales. He was also a well-known craftsman, respected because he made traditional and beautiful things. One of his carved love-spoons won first prize in the National Eisteddfod in 1937.

The exhibition was curated by Muriel Rose, the British Council officer for crafts and industrial art. The Rural Industries Bureau, the National Federation of Women’s Institute and Highland Home Industries assisted with sourcing items. This co-operation ensured geographical diversity and the inclusion of regional objects.

The exhibition itinerary was impressive. It launched in Auckland, New Zealand, then toured both North and South Islands before 'crossing the ditch' to Sydney where it launched again before touring  some of the larger rural centres in New South Wales.  It went on to the Australian Capital Territory and the States of Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia.

Overall, four hundred and twenty objects packed into forty-two shipping cases arrived in Auckland in March 1947 and departed from Perth in January 1950. That’s a very long journey for a travelling exhibition.

I live in Australia. Imagine my excitement when I tracked down the exhibition catalogue in the Adelaide Art Gallery! With 63 pages, it's packed with information about the project. It lists 134 exhibitors, describes all the objects, presents 12 full-page photographs, and even gives details of the small travelling library. It includes an introductory note and a preface.

The catalogue's introductory note is very clear on two points. First, that the exhibition contains only examples of handicrafts that were still being practiced in the British countryside. Second, that it was confined to the work of traditional craftsmen and women, who, with very few exceptions, would not think of themselves  as artists or designers but those whose work, nevertheless, so greatly enriches the daily life of those who live with and use their product.

The preface was written by H J Massingham (1885-1952) at the time a well-known writer, poet and champion of the countryside and rural trades. Massingham was known to hold the view that handicrafts should demonstrate the merging of beauty and utility. In his preface, he comes very close to writing that craftspeople could achieve beauty from utility without deliberately intending it or even thinking about it.

Massingham visited the exhibition before it was shipped abroad, taking the time to view and appreciate the objects. He looked at some axe handles made of wood (ash) and asks, 'Why do your fingers itch to grasp them?' About the grain scoops made by my grandfather, he commented, 'You understand at once what a high degree of pleasure and absorption in his job the craftsman must have felt'.

The exhibition featured the work of 134 exhibitors from England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland. Of the 420 artifacts were chosen, some were small like the custom-made horseshoes, some were large like the Welsh coracle. Coracles are easy to admire. Their origin goes back to Roman times yet they're still to be found in West Wales and Ireland. They're  a one person boat, traditionally made with strips of willow and animal skin and generally used for fishing.

The exhibition was popular, interesting and appreciated in both New Zealand and Australia.

Stuart MacLennan, Director of the National Art Gallery of New Zealand wrote, 'The collections represented, primarily, good workmanship and the unconscious beauty that results from the use of natural materials worked with a sympathetic skill and understanding in the production of useful objects. We saw wood, metal, clay, wool, and leather used in the making of agricultural implements, utensils, baskets, pottery, fabric, and harness.' (Design Review, Journal of the Architectural Centre, Wellington, April 1947)

Using the Australian database,Trove, we can track newspaper reports of the exhibition making its way right across Australia. Overwhelmingly, reports and reactions were appreciative.

In Sydney, the National Gallery's Art Critic commented 'Every implement seems inspired by a tradition which transforms it into an object of great beauty'. The critic was impressed by the abundance of displays 'from a coracle used by fishermen since ancient times to brooms straight from the witches sabbath'.

After seeing the grain scoops and ladles (David Lewis's work), the critic comments, 'they speak of a culture in everyday life which would take centuries to emulate here. They are the work of a master craftsman'. (Sydney Morning Herald 20 April 1948)

In Taree, New South Wales, 'Everything in it gives expression to an artistic beauty, while at the same time it was meant to be used in the daily life of the people'. (The Northern Champion Taree 12 June 1948)

Blacksmiths, basket weavers, metal shapers, harness makers, wood turners, wood carvers, hand knitters, hand quilters, weavers, potters, coracle makers – each of these crafts (and more) were represented in the exhibition.

David Lewis contributed ten hand-carved wooden utensils that he'd made from local timber using simple tools (cutting axe, short handled axe, sharp knife).

I first heard about my grandfather's craft work through my father. He told me that when he was young, his father would sometimes work away and had taken to woodcarving in the evenings. He said that his father often used sycamore, especially for dairy items, but his favourite wood was apple because it was hard, dense, and almost white.

He was also skilled at basket making and calligraphy, and was in general a thoughtful man who was good with shire horses. One of my fondest memories is that he sometimes posted a rabbit to us. It would be gutted but not skinned and arrive with an address label tied with string around its middle.

My grandfather knew the exact purpose of the utensils he made and how they would be used because his work as a labourer gave him a knowledge of all aspects of farming. From his mother he learnt from an early age about work in the household and the family dairy. This knowledge would have helped him combine traditional good design with fitness for purpose.

In the early post-war period, making things from scratch and following the old ways were still practiced in Great Britain. Later reforms would ensure that agriculture and farming were modernised and mechanised. Old trades would be lost, horses would be phased out, and farriers and blacksmiths would not be needed.

This exhibition that started off celebrating 'present day' handicrafts now has the potential to be a 'historical treasure'.

My view of the exhibition is that it really does commemorate genuine rural accomplishments and the sense of community. It embraced the diversity of rural communities of the UK and tangible objects once commonplace. It is both reflective and a project of its time.

This blog was written by Dr Jennifer Lewis, a Welsh Australian. She is now retired following a long working life in the cultural heritage sector (Archives, Libraries and Museums).

Many objects in European museums are catalogued as 'chintz', representing the material memories of global connections.

The word chintz originates from a plural version of the Hindi word for 'bright'. It originally indicated a woodblock printed, painted or stained cotton / calico produced in India from 1600 to 1800, splendidly decorated with floral patterns. The textile arrived in Europe during the 17th and 18th century on the ships of the East India Companies, all the way from the Coromandel coast in South-East India.

Initially these fabrics were used for curtains, furnishing fabrics, and bed hangings and covers. It has been suggested that they began to be worn as clothes began when these were replaced and given to maids and servants, who made them into dresses, and also that they were first worn as linings.

The Dutch East India Company was the main importer of chintz fabrics to Europe during the 17th and 18th century. During this period in the Netherlands, the sale of both original chintz and reproductions flourished, as they were not banned by the Dutch government. Over the years chintz was used both for fashionable and for regional dress. The country catered to its neighbours, to which the Dutch merchandise and the Indian originals were smuggled.

By 1680, chintz had become massively popular. So much so that chintz started being considered a threat for national textile industries.

French and English citizens were prohibited to either produce, import or even wear it for over 70 years, respectively from 1686, when France declared a ban on all chintz imports, and in 1721, when the Parliament of Great Britain forbade 'the Use and Warings in Apparel of imported chintz, and also its use or Wear in or about any Bed, Chair, Cushion or other Household furniture'. Spain was the third country to ban imports from India and also European imitations in 1728.

Dutch entrepreneurs went to lengths to try and reproduce Indian chintz. In India, most of the designs were painted by hand. Printing reproductions in the Low Countries remained time-consuming.

It was indeed a long process: it would take months to make the natural dyes, clean the fabric (beating it with wooden bats), preparing it with a tannin solution (retrieved from plants), submerging it in various baths, rinsing and drying.

Colour dying always happened in the same order: black, red, blue, purple, yellow and green. Some of the colours appeared only when the fabric, hand painted or printed with a type of mordant, was plunged in a dye bath afterwards. Others could be applied to the fabric directly. The bleaching of the white background, which needed to be repeated several times, required a good amount of sun and goat or cow dung. Finishing happened with rice water, in order to make it sturdy; the shiny look was obtained by calendering or by waxing and polishing with a shell.

The popularity of these textiles is documented by the many holdings that European museums have of chintz. They are all fascinating objects that tell stories of desire, imitation, craftsmanship and technology.

Who was Max Euwe?

What championships did Max Euwe win?

What books did Max Euwe write?

Max Euwe was a Dutch chess grandmaster and mathematician who was the fifth World Chess Champion, as well as the president of the World Chess Federation.

Born as Machgielis Euwe on May 20 1901 in Amsterdam, he began playing chess at a young age. He studied mathematics at the University of Amsterdam, and later earned a doctorate.

He spent most of his professional life working in teaching and education, in both schools and universities.

From the early 1920s, he became the leading chess player inthe Netherlands.

From 1921 to 1952, he won all the Dutch chess championships which he took part in.

In 1928, he became a world champion for the first time by winning the Amateur World Chess Championship which was held in The Hague.

Euwe's greatest achievement in chess was becoming World Champion in 1935, by defeating the reigning champion Alexander Alekhine. The match was played over many games in various cities and towns in the Netherlands between October and December that year. Euwe's world title aroused enthusiasm for chess in the Netherlands, with many Dutch clubs being founded in 1935.

Recognising his role as a leading chess player, he was the author of more than 70 books on chess, includingStrategy and Tactics in Chessin 1937,Judgement and Planning in Chessin 1954 andThe Road to Chess Mastery, with Walter Meiden, in 1966.

Euwe was also involved in the administration ofchess.

He served as the President of the World Chess Federation (FIDE) from 1970 to 1978. During his tenure - despite many conflicts with the USSR Chess Federation - he worked to improve the organisation and regulation of international chess tournaments and to promote the growth of chess as a sport.

Euwe passed away on November 26, 1981, but his legacy in the world of chess lives on where he is remembered for his skills and dedication to the game.

Today in the centre of Amsterdam, he is remembered by a monument in the centre of a square named Max Euwe Plein.

The Romanian Greek-Catholic Church (or the Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic) emerged in the 18th century in Transylvania, a multi-religious, multi-ethnic region (incorporated into the Habsburg Empire in the mid-17th century, today part of Romania since 1918). It is an Eastern Catholic Church which uses the Byzantine liturgical rite, and today has more than 150,000 followers. The Greek-Catholic Church in Transylvania has had an important role in developing Romanian national consciousness by emphasising the Latin character of the Romanian language.

The history of this religion is closely linked to the small city of Blaj, the religious and cultural centre of the Romanian Greek-Catholic Church in Transylvania. In 1737, the headquarters of the Archdiocese of Alba Iulia and Făgăraș moved there.

The fame of this historical and spiritual place is primarily due to its schools and eminent teachers. In 1754, the first public school in Transylvania that used Romanian as the main teaching language opened here and the first Romanian school books were printed in the local printing house.

Having an irreproachable moral and pedagogical status, the teacher-priests in old Blaj were outstanding models for poor pupils from the countryside. The most prominent figure among them was Timotei Cipariu (1805-1887), a linguist, historian, educator. He was one of the founding members of the Romanian Academy in Bucharest, and is considered to be 'the father of Romanian philology'.

Born in a family of peasants in a village near Blaj, Timotei Cipariu became a legendary figure, a model for every peasant boy struggling to overcome their poverty and lack of formal education through hard work and study. He proved to everybody that love for knowledge was enough to become one of the greatest scholars of his times, despite not having attended the well-known universities in Budapest or Vienna.

Cipariu's work and activity is impressive. He consistently contributed to various branches of science from linguistics and philology to history, theology, journalism, culture and politics. He wrote studies on Romanian linguistics and history, aiming to prove the historical rights of the Romanian people and their Roman origin. He proposed the usage of words of Latin origin and the avoidance of words of non-Latin origin.

He was one of the pioneers of the Romanian journalism in Transylvania through the periodicals he founded and managed, among which:Organul luminărei, the first Romanian newspaper written in Latin alphabet (1847) andArchivu pentru filologie și istorie, the first Romanian magazine of philology (1867).

Cipariu was one of the founding members, the first vice-president (1861-1866) and the president (1877-1887) ofASTRA - Transylvanian Association for Romanian Literature and the Culture of the Romanian People, a cultural association founded in 1861 that had an important role in the development of the national awareness of the Romanians in Transylvania. He was also a member of the German Society of Oriental Studies from Leipzig.

To complete his portrait, we must mention his contributions in the field of Romanian literature: poetry, memoirs, oratory or correspondence and literary history, theory and criticism.

But beyond his accomplishments in various cultural and religious fields, what is really astonishing was his worship for books and libraries. He was the owner of one of the most valuable private libraries in Transylvania. He was also a wonderful linguist: he learned 14 foreign languages all by himself, among which: Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac, Turkish, Persian, Spanish, Italian, German, English and Hungarian.

At the age of 14, he could recite Virgil and Ovid’s works in Latin, and by the age of 16, he knewThe IliadandOdysseyin Ancient Greek by heart. This created a legendary aura around him, with people telling stories about how, having travelled to Constantinople on a horse, he returned to Blaj on foot after four months, with his exhausted horse carrying bags full of rare books.

His research and works were appreciated by his contemporaries. The famous German historian Theodor Mommsen paid him a visit – it is said that he stole one of the very precious Roman wax tablets that Cipariu used to prove that Romanian is a Latin language.

Today, many schools, museums, and reading circles in Transylvania are named after him. Over the years, a whole nation has come to admire his great work and brilliant intelligence.

Who was P. J. H. Cuypers and what buildings did he design?

If you've ever visited Amsterdam, you may have seen the Rijksmuseum or Amsterdam Centraal station. Those buildings, and many more in the Netherlands, are the work of celebrated Dutch architect Pierre Cuypers, also known as P. J. H. Cuypers. Let's explore his architectural legacy.

Pierre Cuypers was born in Roermond, Netherlands in 1827, the ninth child of Maria Bex and Johannes Cuypers. Pierre's family were artistic. His father was a painter of houses and folk scenes. His brothers Henri and Frans both became artists.

Cuypers' love for architecture emerged during his youth, and he chose to study architecture at the Royal Academy of Art in Antwerp, Belgium from 1845.

This training in Antwerp was the foundation for Cuypers' architectural career, where he learned from leading proponents of the Belgian Gothic Revival who taught there.

One of Cuypers' most famous buildings is theRijksmuseumin Amsterdam, which was completed in 1885 and is considered one of the finest examples of Dutch Gothic Revival architecture. He also designed the Amsterdam Central Station, which was completed in 1889 and is now a national monument.

In addition to these major projects, Cuypers worked on numerous churches throughout the Netherlands, including the St. Nicholas Church in Amsterdam and the St. Bavo Church in Haarlem.

In all, he designed close to 100 churches and oversaw the restoration of dozens of churches in the Netherlands.

Cuypers was also an important figure in the development of the Dutch Neo-Gothic movement, which sought to revive architectural styles of theMiddle Ages.

He believed that architecture should be rooted in tradition and should reflect the cultural and historical context of a particular place. This approach is evident in his use of traditional materials and motifs in his buildings.

Cuypers' oeuvre was controversial during his time, but his influence and importance are indisputable. As an architect and government advisor, and due to his membership of national committees, he has had an important impact on Dutch architecture.

Throughout his career, Cuypers received numerous awards and accolades for his work, including the 'Order of the Netherlands Lion', which is the highest honour that can be bestowed upon a Dutch citizen.

Today, his buildings continue to be important cultural landmarks in the Netherlands and are widely admired for their beauty and architectural significance.

Collect and save your favourite objects

Get your creative juices flowing

World Collage Day is an annual international celebration of collage on the second Saturday of May.

Collage is a versatile art form practised for centuries.

It started with 12th-century Japanese calligraphers who used bits of paper and fabric to create backgrounds for their poems. From medieval times to the 19th century, people used materials like gemstones, shells, straw, and hair to enhance their art.

However, in the early 20th century, collage emerged as a fine art medium with the cubist experiments of Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso in France.

Since then, collage has evolved, and artists used it to explore ideas, advocate concepts, and develop new directions in their work. Today, it has a permanent place among artistic media such as drawing, painting, printmaking, and sculpture.

Collage is a low-threshold art form, you don't need experience or any specific skills to try. It's a nice way to explore and remix artworks, vintage photos, historical documents. And you can mix them with other materials - old paper, labels, packaging found at home.

Here's how to make a collage using cultural heritage collections, in a few simple steps:

Start by exploring work of well known collage artists such as Hannah Höch, Man Ray, Kurt Schwitters and Joseph Cornell.

And if you feel like inviting some serendipity to your explorations - there are many more examples of collage artworks from across Europe and from various periods in history available on Europeana website. Browse through them and see which ones catch your attention.

Selimiye Mosque in Nicosia

Giralda Bell Tower in Seville

Downtown Candlemas Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Pécs

Church of Saint Nicholas in Chania

Hagia Sophia in Thessaloniki

Throughout European history, religions have shaped communities and their interactions with each other. In some cases, the lasting legacies of these interactions live on within religious architecture.

Here are five buildings and structures across Europe that have been both mosques and churches during their histories.

This building was built between the 12th and 14th centuries as a Gothic church. It may have been constructed on the location of a former Byzantine cathedral.

The Cathedral of Saint Sophia, as it was known, was the site for the coronations of Cyprus’ kings until the Republic of Venice took over the island in 1489.

Following a siege in 1570, Cyprus fell under the control of the Ottomans, who converted the building into a mosque. They added two minarets to the exterior, which still stand to this day.

This UNESCO World Heritage Site, which is now part of the Seville Cathedral, was constructed as a minaret during the reign of al-Andalus. Its accompanying mosque, the Great Mosque of Seville, was completed in 1176, although the minaret itself was not completed until 1198.

After the Siege of Seville during the Reconquista, Seville came under the control of Christians in 1248. They converted the mosque into a church containing a set of small family chapels. The building was subsequently neglected and then damaged during an earthquake in 1356.

During the 15th and 16th centuries, the church was replaced with the current building, with a belfry added to the top of the former minaret. It is topped by a bronze sculpture known as the Giraldillo.

This building, which stands on Széchenyi Square in Pécs in Hungary, was initially built as a mosque by the Ottoman ruler Pasha Qasim the Victorious. It was completed in 1546.

Pécs was taken by the Kingdom of Hungary in 1702, when the mosque was converted into a Roman Catholic church. The interior and exterior have since been altered significantly. In 1766, the minaret was demolished.

This building on the Greek island Crete has been used by three different religions.  Initially, it was constructed as a Catholic cathedral in the early 14th century.

During the Cretan War in the 17th century, Chania was taken over by the Ottomans, and the building was converted into a mosque known as Hünkar Mosque.

In 1918, the building was converted into an Orthodox Christian church. During the 1923 exchange of Christian and Muslim populations between Greece and Turkey, the Turkish Dervish sword, which had played a role in converting the building into a mosque, was taken away by the departing Muslims.

This UNESCO World Heritage Site, which was modelled after the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, was constructed in the 7th century after the structure that previously stood in its place was destroyed by an earthquake.

In 1430, the Ottomans captured the city and converted the building into a mosque.

In 1912, after the liberation of Thessaloniki, the structure was converted into a Christian church.

These are just a handful of the many buildings and structures that have changed religious hands during European history. While many of these changes were rooted in political shifts and power struggles, the buildings stand steadfastly as places of worship, whatever the religion.

Who was Mela Muter?

How was Mela Muter connected to Girona?

Painting the beauty of everyday life

Mela Muter was a Polish artist based in Paris from the early 1900s onwards. She was one of the few Jewish women artists of her time who gained international recognition for her work.

Born in 1876 in Warsaw, her birth name was Maria Melania Klingsland.

She studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw. In 1899, she married art critic and writer Michal Mutermilch, while continuing her own artistic studies. In 1901, she moved with her family to Paris, where she enrolled at the Académie Colarossi and the Académie de la Grande Chaumière.

She began to exhibit her paintings both in Paris and Poland, captivating the Parisian art scene during the early 1900s.

Muter gained a reputation as a popular portrait painter in Paris, portraying wealthy and notable individuals in the city. She also made many artworks which had motherhood as a theme, as well as still lifes and landscapes.

During World War I, she had an affair with writer and activist Raymond Lefebvre which led to her and her husband divorcing.

In March 1914, she first visited Girona in Spain, returning several times.

She introduced the local artistic community to the new trends of the cosmopolitan art of Paris. Her impact in Girona's art scene was such that today a square in the city is named after her.

After World War I, Muter's style again changed. She no longer wished to paint reality but hoped to capture the beauty in her surroundings.

She converted to Catholicism in 1924, after her father's death. However, during World War II, due to her Jewish origins, she felt in danger during Nazi occupation. She moved from Paris to Avignon where she taught drawing, art history and literature.

After the war, she returned to Paris. Despite problems with her eyesight, she continued to paint until her death in 1967 at the age of 85.

Her legacy as a pioneering female artist has endured, and her work continues to be admired for its bold, expressive style and its celebration of the beauty and vitality of everyday life.

What is the history of tulips?

How tulips became a Dutch symbol

In springtime, tulips are one of nature's loveliest sights, returning each year in a variety of bright colours.

Tulips are a simple but significant flower in European culture, with a rich history that dates back centuries. Their history has brought them from Central Asia to the Ottoman Empire and then to Western Europe, becoming a symbol of all three along the way.

Tulips originated in Central Asia, and were first cultivated in Iran (Persia) as early as the 10th century.

Many historical sources have evidence of how tulips came to Europe over the centuries. By the 16th century, tulips were being cultivated in the Ottoman Empire. They were among the most prized flowers for the Ottoman Empire, and became a symbol of their power.

Ottoman sultans and wealthy elites were known for their love of tulips. They held tulip festivals, which were attended by people from all over the world. This fascination with tulips inspired a unique decorative style which features motifs of tulips on carpets, clothing, paintings, buildings, and pottery.

Nobody knows for sure who brought tulips from the Ottoman Empire to Western Europe, but it is credited to an ambassador of the Habsburg Empire in Constantinople (Istanbul) who brought some tulip bulbs to Vienna.

Botanist Carolus Clusius increased the popularity of tulips in the late 16th century. He planted tulip bulbs at the Vienna ImperialBotanical Gardensin 1573, and made the first botanical research into tulips in 1592.

He was then appointed to be the director of Leiden University's botanic garden, planting tulips there in late 1593.

Tulips had reached the Netherlands, and were about to bloom in popularity!

The Dutch became so enamoured with tulips in the 17th century that their passion for the flower sparked a phenomenon known as 'Tulip Mania.'

During this time, tulip bulbs became incredibly valuable and were traded like stocks on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. At the height of 'Tulip Mania', some rare tulip bulbs were worth more than a house!

Tulips became a popular subject in art, especially during the 17th century when artists painted still-life portraits of the flowers. These paintings not only captured the beauty of the flower but also served as a status symbol for the wealthy.

In addition to painting, tulips also played a significant role inEuropean craft. Dutch Delftware, a type of blue and white pottery, often features tulip designs, while the motif appears on many other items.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, tulip growing, along with other flowers, became a major industry inthe Netherlands.

The country became the centre of global tulip trade, with bulbs exported all around the world. New techniques and varieties were cultivated.

The association of tulips with the Netherlands was cemented in the 1950s with the songTulips from Amsterdam. Originally sung in German, soon Dutch and English versions followed. It became a hit for the English singer Max Bygraves in 1958, as well as many other singers around the world since.

Today, the Netherlands is the largest producer of tulips in the world, and the flower is a major part of the country's economy. Tulips have become one of the most popular symbols of the Netherlands, reflected in many paintings, artworks and souvenirs.

Make your own easter Palm!

Learn how to make an easter palm

Easter palms are traditionally used in Catholic celebrations during Palm Sunday, the Sunday before Easter. To commemorate Christ's triumphant entry into Jerusalem, people bring palm fronds to be blessed in the church and then walk with their palms in a procession. Palm Sunday is also called Passion Sunday, or Care Sunday.

Other countries celebrate Palm Sunday in different ways. For example, in Italy, where palm trees are less common than in Israel, olive branches are used in the solemn procession on Palm Sunday.

In Poland and neighbouring countries, where neither palms nor olive trees are popular, other customs have sprouted. Polish people cut twigs of poplar, willow or raspberry on Ash Wednesday, and braid them into palms. The willow is one of the trees that blooms the earliest in Spring. Because of being early bloomers, willows are an important Christian symbol for resurrection and for the immortality of the soul.

Blessed palms used on Palm Sunday are often taken home, where they're supposed to protect the house and the farmyard.

Today, Easter palms are still made of willow branches and decorated with colourful flowers. These flowers can either be real dried flowers or fake flowers made out of tissue paper. Folk artists specialize in creating palms, treating them as a craft that ensures their livelihood.

Some artisanal families specialize in the production of palms and dedicate their entire lives to this activity. Starting from sowing the appropriate cereals, grasses and flowers, and then picking, drying, and dyeing their crops to produce and sell their unique palms. The Kurpie region, in Polish Mazovia, didn't have the right conditions to grow the needed flowers and cereals to create easter palms. Therefore the Kurpie region adopted the cultural tradition of creating particularly distinctive paper flowers and decorative palms for Palm Sunday. Every year on Palm Sunday in Łyse, in Kurpie, competitions are held for the tallest and most beautiful palm.

To get started with your own Kurpie-style easter Palm, you'll need some necessary material: crêpe paper, thin (satay) sticks, scissors, pencils, glue and fine wire or strong thread.

Choose the colour of crêpe paper from which you will create your Kurpie palm and decide on the type of flowers you'd like to make. These can be small crocuses, larger roses, or any other flowers that you can imagine. Once you've made your decision, start following the instructions for cutting your chosen paper accordingly.

Fold your cut crêpe paper at the edge to arrange the flower petals nicely. Then properly roll up a strip of tissue paper to form a flower.

Once you have prepared enough flowers for your palm, you can start to arrange them around your satay stick. Start the composition from the top. Each element (flower or leaf) applied to the stick should be immediately attached (wrapped) with a thin wire or strong thread.

It might take a while to get the hang of cutting, folding and attaching your flowers, but after a while you should have acquired some new skills, and most importantly, a hand-made Kurpie palm!

The palm you made is more or less comparable to the Kurpie craftsman's products available for sale. However, if you are not satisfied with your product or would like to have more palms, you can buy them at the stands or play with creating Kurpie palms at home.

Pioneering female scientist in 18th century Bologna

Laura Bassi was a pioneering Italian physicist and academic in the 18th century, who was one of the first woman in the world to reach a series of milestones in science and education.

Born in Bologna in 1711, Bassi was privately tutored during her childhood, receiving an education in the sciences and mathematics.

She attended the University of Bologna where she was awarded a doctorate degree in 1732. She was the first woman in the world to receive a doctorate in science, and only the second woman to receive a philosophy doctorate (the first being Elena Cornaro Piscopia).

She then began working at the University of Bologna, making her the first salaried female teacher in the university and in the world.

However, as a woman, she was more restricted in delivering public lectures than her male colleagues, as the univerisity believed that women should live private lives. Throughout her time working at the University of Bologna, she campaigned to be treated as an equal to the university's male lecturers, but to no avail.

Bassi's work had a profound impact on the field of physics, influencing the work of many of her contemporaries and future scientists. Her research paved the way for further discoveries in the field and helped to establish it as a separate discipline. She authored around 28 different papers, the majority of which were on physics and hydraulics.

Bassi was a strong advocate for the education of women and worked to increase their access to higher education in the sciences. As the first woman in her field, she became well-known and was popularly depicted as a 'Bolognese Minerva', the Roman goddess of wisdom and arts.

Later in her career, in the 1750s, she was granted permission to start private lessons and was given funding to do experiments from her home. This allowed her to avoid the restrictions placed by the university regulations. At the same time, she was among the highest paid employee of the university.

By the end of her life, she was also a Professor in two other institutions - the Collegio Montalto and the Academy of the Institute for Sciences in Bologna.

Bassi died in 1778, aged 66. She is remembered today as a pioneering figure in physics and a trailblazer for women in the sciences.

The first woman to convert to Islam in Liverpool

Fatima Elizabeth Cates (5 January 1865 ‒ 29 October 1900) was probably the first woman to convert to Islam in Liverpool. She came to Islam in 1887 at the hands of Abdullah Quilliam (1856‒1932).

Like many of the early Liverpool converts, she showed remarkable resilience and steadfastness in the face of considerable hostility and harassment from intolerant locals as well as her own family.

She played a leading role in the life of the Liverpool Muslim Institute, which she co-founded. She was active and successful in calling others to Islam, and representing the Institute both nationally and internationally. Fatima was the first treasurer of a mosque in Britain, serving for eight years between 1887‒1894. At the time it was charmingly but inaccurately claimed in her obituary in Manchester'sDaily Dispatch, that 'she was the first lady ever converted to Islam in England'.

Born to a working class family in Birkenhead, Frances Elizabeth Murray showed signs of an independent and curious mind. She was unafraid to act on her convictions. She was in the first cohort of children to receive instruction under the Education Act of 1870.

By her early twenties she was secretary to a local chapter of the Temperance Movement, which campaigned to limit and ultimately end the consumption of alcohol. It was through this association that Frances first heard Quilliam speak on the 'great Arabian teetotaler', the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, in June 1887.

Frances still had more questions, but Quilliam advised her to read the Quran and make up her own mind. Despite the strenuous attempts of her family to frustrate and dissuade her, Frances became Fatima in a matter of weeks. In July, Fatima co-founded the Liverpool Muslim Society with Quilliam and another convert, Ali Hamilton, renting an upstairs room at Mount Vernon Temperance Hall.

In those first two years, through hard work they gained eleven more converts despite the ruffians who disrupted their meetings or waylaid them coming in or out of them. Fatima had horse dung smeared in her face on more than one occasion by them, but she was dauntless.

When the fledgling community moved to expanded premises at 8 Brougham Terrace in December 1889, Fatima became the face of the rebooted Liverpool Muslim Institute as its international profile grew, particularly in British India, where her poetry and prose was published in the Allahabad Review. And, despite her family’s opposition, she succeeded in bringing her husband, Hubert Henry Cates, and two of her sisters, Clara and Annie, to the faith.

In addition, she brought a number of other women to Islam, including Alice 'Amina' Bertha Bowman, Hannah 'Fatma' Rodda Robinson, Leah 'Zuleika' Banks, and Amy ‘Amina' Mokaiesh. Like Fatima, all four of these women either married other converts from the Liverpool community or married born Muslims.

It is all the more remarkable that Fatima’s greatest successes came at the moment of her heaviest trial. Throughout the first two years of her marriage, she had to contend with an abusive, violent and, at times, murderous husband. She sued for divorce in December 1891, but was only granted a year’s separation. Nonetheless, their marriage was effectively over and they lived separately until his death at sea in January 1895.

In this period, Fatima began to lessen her active involvement in the Institute and spent time away from Liverpool travelling to the East (probably to Beirut) and taking landscape photography in Southern England.

In October 1900, the community’s newspaper,The Crescent, dolefully announced the death and funeral of Fatima.

It claimed that she had spent the last years of her life as a lonely widow, living twenty miles away from the Institute in the coastal town of West Kirby where she lived with Cate’s posthumous son, Hubert Haleem, and ran a boarding house. However, this was a cover story.

In fact, the available documentary evidence indicates that Fatima became Quilliam’s third and secret wife in 1895 and that the boy was his. It was well known in the community that Quilliam advocated and practised polygamy, maintaining two separate households. On his birth certificate, Hubert Haleem is surnamed 'Quilliam Cates', and photographs show a remarkable likeness between Quilliam and his so-called fostered child. Quilliam was a doting if distant father to Hubert Haleem, and left him as an equal beneficiary in his will alongside his other surviving nine children.

It is fitting that, 122 years after her death, Fatima's unmarked grave in Anfield Cemetery was marked on 4 November 2022 with a marble headstone. The funds for it were raised by a local Muslim woman, Amirah Scarisbrick. It had the following inscription, featuring a stanza of Fatima's own poetry:

A faithful servant of AllahFatima Elizabeth Cates1865‒1900Then may we ever heed,The warning God has given,That so we may in safety treadThe road that leads to HeavenFEC 1892

Yahya Birt is co-author with Hamid Mahmood of the new biography,Our Fatima of Liverpool: The Story of Fatima Cates, the Victorian woman who helped found British Islam. It is available from Beacon Books in Oldham.

Women of wisdom and courage

The achievements and efforts of women throughout history have sometimes been bold, and at other times, subtle. This subtlety is noted especially in the efforts of the medieval mystics.

Writing in convents or cells as the anchorites did (those withdrawing from secular society for exampleJulian of Norwich), we see these subtleties of challenge to the oppressive theologies established by church authority; theologies that often denigrated women.

Mystics such as Christine de Pizan (The Book of the City of Ladies) wrote against the misogynistic ideas about women and sin, thereby revealing their intelligent and logical ability to argue against the practices that made women subservient to men both in secular and religious society.  Pizan, the first professional and female author challenged the notions of womanhood derived from Jean Meun’s Poem, The Romance of the Rose about the corrupt nature of women.

Likewise, Julian of Norwich challenged the mainstream theological thinking about the nature of God by arguing for a feminine presence that is articulated in the motif of the mother; the mother that evokes images of kindness, nurturing, and caring.  She experienced 16 ‘showings’ (revelations from God) as she refers to them that reveal her understanding of God as both mother and father. She was the first woman to write a book in English, Revelations of Divine Love, in which she explains her encounters with God. This book, even today, influences the ways feminist theologians see the nature of God-one that includes the feminine divine as part of that understanding.

Her thinking is revolutionary given her isolation from the world. Interestingly, during the COVID lockdown [as was for Julian, the lockdown mirrored the occurring plague epidemics in her life], many people, including theologians reconsidered her importance about current ideas regarding the nature of God, explaining that her understanding of the feminine presence in the Godhead (the essence of God in Christianity) was one that still speaks to us 500 years later.

The mystic St. Therese of Lisieux, too, in subtle language expressed her understanding of the Godhead. Although her theology in its expression is traditional, that is to say a classic Catholic theology; what makes it different was the simple language she used to urge people to consider the importance of humility and rather offer what she called ‘little acts of love’. However, if one examines some of her ‘feminist’ ideas revealed in her writings, i.e. Story of a Soul, she proclaims her desire to be priest, to be Crusader for Christ, to be a doctor, to be an Apostle. These are all traditionally male dominated professions; two of which have never been filled by a woman.

She was bold in her thinking, challenging the boundaries of what women can do within the structure of a church that still today does not recognise women as priests. And yet, she actually was proclaimed a Doctor of the Church, in 1997, one hundred years after her death. Her work, her thinking, and her sense of mission, testifies to a strong sense of the eternal God. This is a God that gives women courage to resist oppression as demonstrated when she went on pilgrimage in 1887 to Italy where Pope Leo XIII refused to officially support her appeal to be allowed to become a Carmelite (religious order within the Catholic church). She refused to leave and was carried out of the church.

Therese died in 1897 and was beatified (deceased person's entrance into heaven and their capacity to intercede on behalf of those who honour or pray to them) in 1923. It was how she resonated with ordinary people that contributed to her early beatification. She is the most popular saint in modern times (as Pope Pious X declared) and she can be found in churches all over the world, thereby attesting to what courageous women can and have contributed to religious thinking and practice.

Attention to the lives of women in medieval and modern times give us insights into the long history of women advocating for their dignity as human beings and serious contributors to all facets of human achievement.

Delia Derbyshire

Daphne Oram

Making electronic music more playful

Female pioneers of electronic music

We listen to music made with electronic computerised instruments all the time these days. But in the 1960s, electronic music was new, and artists were experimenting with different ways to produce sound.

Let's find out about two pioneers in this field - Delia Derbyshire, who came up with the original Doctor Who theme, and Daphne Oram, who invented a machine to draw music with.

Delia Derbyshire had a gift for creating unique sounds and music with very basic means.

It's#DeliaDerbyshireDay, a day to celebrate the pioneering electronic musician who helped pave the way for sampling in music by a few decades (using tape rather than computers). Check out the ace charity@DeliaDDay, set up in her honour to run music/inclusion activities & more.pic.twitter.com/cvUZyUpHdX

Starting with the sound of an object being tapped, a plucked string or a sine-wave-generator, and splicing, looping and mixing everything together using an array of tape recorders, she created something new and highly personal. The results were so unique that modern digital instruments cannot even mimic them.

After she graduated from Cambridge University with a BA in Mathematics and Music in 1959, she applied for a job with Decca records to be told that they didn’t hire women in their studios. She then briefly worked as a maths and music teacher, joined the BBC as a trainee assistant studio manager in 1960 and moved to the Radiophonic Workshop inMaida Valein 1962.

A year later, Delia Derbyshire was handed a page by composer Ron Grainer with a bass line, and a few written notes like ‘clouds’, ‘wind’ and ‘bubbles’ but no indication of what the piece of music should sound like. He went on vacation for two weeks and when he returned, Delia presented her interpretation to him. His reaction was ‘Did I really write this?’

‘Most of it’, she replied. That music was the original Dr Who theme, used from 1963 to 1980. Despite Grainer’s plea, she was never credited: according to the BBC’s policy she wasn’t a composer, but a workshop assistant.

In the 11 years she spent with the Radiophonic Workshop, Delia created music for many other BBC programmes. Together with colleague Brian Hodgson - with whom Delia had previously set up electronic music organisation Unit Delta Plus - and musician David Vorhaus, she set up the Kaleidophon studio in Camden.

Kaleidophon produced music for theatre productions. In 1968, as the band White Noise, they created their debut albumAn Electric Storm. It was produced before synthesisers were available, using Radiophonic Workshop techniques: real-world sounds and basic electronic sources like tone generators. With tracks like 'Here come the fleas' (an absurd blend of song and comedy, stapled together with goofy cartoon noises) and 'The Visitation' (a rendition of a psychic encounter), it is possibly the most unusual album ever.

The BBC Radiophonic Workshop - where Delia Derbyshire worked - was set up in 1958, with composer and musician Daphne Oram as its first studio manager. Oram had worked for the BBC since 1942, and reportedly often stayed after hours, experimenting with tape recorders until late at night.

Daphne Oram, the British pioneer of electronic music and founder of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, was born today in 1925.Next year we will be releasing, among other projects, a box set of her unedited work on CD.pic.twitter.com/XhREepFNKk

Developing an interest in sound manipulation and synthetic sound, she composed Still Point, a work for turntables, ‘double orchestra’ and five microphones - in the 1940s! It was rejected by the BBC but eventually performed for the first time in 2016 and had its BBC Proms premiere in 2018.

Electronic music and musique concrète (music constructed by mixing recorded sounds) were avant-garde in the 1950s and taken up by composers like Edgard Varèse and Karl-Heinz Stockhausen. Oram received commissions to compose music for several productions.

Still, the BBC’s overall reluctance to embrace new developments in music seems to have frustrated her. Less than a year after the Radiophonic Workshop started, Oram left to pursue her own ambitions. She set up her own Electronic Composition studio, developed a novel sound drawing technique (‘Oramics’) and built anOramics machine- a ‘composing machine’.

The basic idea was to control the sound by drawing shapes on clear 35mm film strips: one strip controlling pitch, other strips controlling things like volume, timbre or vibrato. It’s a remarkably direct way of creating sound. There’s still nothing quite like it (check out thisexample,another example, and alonger example), even with all the amazing possibilities offered by today’s digital audio workstations.

As well as producing music for theatre, film, and commercials, Daphne Oram continued to further develop Oramics well into the 1980s. She also lectured and wrote a book about electronic music and studio techniques.

Daphne Oram and Delia Derbyshire both used new technology to create their highly personal styles. They were also both frustrated by how mass adoption of that technology limited its expressive capabilities; Derbyshire arguably more so than Oram because she felt that synthesisers with their uniform bland sound were the antithesis of her musique concrète approach to creating music. When a huge EMS Synthi 100 was installed in the Workshop, she left. Derbyshire quit creating music altogether in 1975.

But there’s a growing interest in the work of pioneers like Derbyshire and Oram. After Delia passed away in 2001, a Derbyshire ‘techno dance track’ from the mid-1960s was found in her archive, prompting comments like‘quite amazing’, ‘timeless’ and ‘This could be coming out next week on Warp Records’, turning her into a cult figure of sorts. Her archive of hundreds of open reel tapes was donated to Manchester University andhas been made accessible.

The same goes for Oram. The original Oramics machine found after she passed away intrigued people so much it was displayed in the London Science Museum, prompting a software recreation for the iPad and inspiring other people topick up where she left off.

The Great Depression

After Pearl Harbor

Legacy

Dorothea Lange was an American photojournalist and documentary photographer most notably known for her Great Depression-era work.

She was born in 1895 to second-generation German immigrant parents in New Jersey, USA. At the age of five, she contracted polio which left her right leg weak and gave her a permanent limp. This had a big impact on her; she said:

I've never gotten over it, and I am aware of the force and power of it.

She felt that the disability guided, instructed and helped her. While her early work involved shooting portraits of the social elite in San Francisco in her studio, her most iconic works come from her Great Depression documentary photography.

At the start of the 1930s, around 14 million Americans were out of work, with three  million people migrating to California to find opportunities. Dorothea left her photography studio to document their lives.

What she found was poverty and exploitation of migrant labourers and sharecroppers. The image above was taken in a cotton pickers’ camp in Nipomo, California. It highlights the gravity of the situation. A makeshift tent has been put together, a pile of collected wood sits at the far corner of the picture and a child and an adult can be seen peering out of their shelter.

Dorothea reported the conditions to the editor of a San Francisco newspaper. Federal authorities were informed and an article was published with some of the images Lange took including the most famousMigrant Mother, which became the most reproduced photograph in the world.

In 1941, after the Pearl Harbor attack, Lange went on assignment for the War Relocation Authority to document the forced evacuation of Japanese Americans.

Dorothea's work in this period focused on the suspense and anxiety that the forced collection and removal caused people. Her photograph shows Asian American school children pledging allegiance to the American flag immediately before being removed from their homes and sent to internment camps. It highlights the distortion of incarceration when no crime has been committed.

These photographs of the internment process were impounded by the authorities and were not made public during  World War II, with authorities seemingly worried about how they might be perceived.

Dorothea died on 11 October 1965 of esophageal cancer. Three months after her death, the Museum of Modern Art in New York held a retrospective exhibition of her work. It was their first retrospective solo exhibition of works by a woman photographer which she had helped curate before her death. 
An elementary school in Nipomo, California, near the site where she had photographedMigrant Mother, was named after her in 2006.

Like everyone, Dorothea Lange was flawed. She made choices at high costs to others (e.gFlorence Ownes Thompson, 'Migrant Mother') and simultaneously humanised difficult moments in American history.

Making contributions to both art and science

Read the stories of eight women who produced some of the most detailed and accurate depictions of plants, making contributions to both art and science, despite challenges, including limited access.

Berthe Hoola van Nooten (1817-1892) was a Dutch botanical artist known for her illustrations in 'Fleurs, Fruits et Feuillages Choisis de l'Ile de Java' in 1863-64.

She published 40 plates depicting interesting plant species from Java in Brussels in 1863. These were dedicated to Sophia Mathilde, wife of King William III of the Netherlands. She was married to Dirk Hoola van Nooten. They travelled together, establishing a Protestant school for girls in New Orleans. She died in poverty in Jakarta at the age of 74.

Madeleine Françoise Basseporte (1701-1780) was a French painter, who was born and died in Paris. Before becoming the Royal Painter for the King's Garden and Cabinet - the first woman artist to hold this position - she specialised in pastel portraits.

Basseporte was best known for botanical illustrations, which took a scientific approach focused on plant structure. She was influential in the education and training of other artists, including King Louis XV's daughters.

Alida Withoos (c.1661/62-1730) was a Dutch botanical artist and painter, born in Amersfoort and trained by her father. Training women in art was not common in her times, but Withoos gained a reputation as a painter, especially for her botanical images.

She was one of the many artists who painted plants at the country house Vijverhof in the service of the art collector and horticulturalist Agnes Block. In 1687, she painted the first pineapple grown in Europe.

Johanna Helena Herolt (1668-1723) was an 18th-century botanical artist from Germany who learned to paint from her mother, Maria Sibylla Merian.

She is well-known for paintings of flowers and botanical subjects, similar to her mother's work. Herolt and her mother collaborated on numerous works, includingThe Insects of Suriname, which proved especially popular. Her paintings are vivid, with rich colours against the vellum. She knew how to arrange plants for maximum impact.

Augusta Hanna Elizabeth Innes Withers (1792-1877) was an English natural history illustrator known for her collaboration with Sarah Drake on theOrchidaceae of Mexico and Guatemalaby horticulturalist James Bateman.

She was appointed 'Flower Painter in Ordinary' to Queen Adelaide and Queen Victoria, and produced illustrations for various publications, including John Lindley'sPomological Magazine.

Sarah Anne Drake (1803–1857) was an English botanical illustrator known for her collaborations with John Lindley and Augusta Innes Withers.

She created more than 1000 illustrations for publications such as Sydenham Edwards'Botanical Register, James Bateman'sOrchidaceae of Mexico and Guatemala, Nathaniel Wallich'sPlantae Asiaticae Rariores, and John Forbes Royle'sIllustrations of the botany and other branches of the natural history of the Himalayan Mountains.

Her career ended when theBotanical Registerwent out of business in 1847, and she returned to Norfolk to care for elderly relatives.

Elisa-Honorine Champin was a French watercolourist and lithographer known for painting flowers, fruit and vegetables.

She first exhibited under her maiden name, Pitet, from 1833 to 1836. After marrying French painter Jean-Jacques Champin in 1837, she started using his name. She created vegetable posters for 'Le Jardin Potager' which were printed by Lemercier & Cie and used as advertisements for Vilmorin-Andrieux, a company which sold seeds.

Frances Elizabeth Tripp (1832-1890) was a British botanist, botanical illustrator, philanthropist and writer. She was the author ofBritish Mosses, their homes, aspects, structures and uses, a two-volume work first published in 1868, which was illustrated by Tripp and coloured by Benjamin Fawcett.

Tripp received a considerable inheritance from her grandmother and used it to pursue scientific research and charitable causes, including supporting the Kyrle Society which aimed for social reform and the establishment of the National Trust.

She died in London in 1890 following a heart attack.

Artist, designer and pioneer of the Glasgow Style

Jessie Marion King was an artist practising in Glasgow, Salford, Paris (as co-founder of the Shieling Atelier), Kirkcudbright, and Arran from the 1890s to 1949.

She worked across various media and crafts producing jewellery, decorated ceramics, and illustrations, especially for books. In the early 1900s, she taught bookbinding and ceramic decoration at the Glasgow School of Art.

A rich source of Jessie’s work can be found among the book covers of the Scottish publishers Gowans and Gray, and those of T. N. Foulis. Adam Luke Gowans, one of Gowans and Gray’s directors in the late 1800s, was appointed the head librarian at the Glasgow School of Art in 1944, and had a long-standing interest in collaborating with the Glasgow artists whose designs graced the covers of many of their books.

Jessie produced beautifully detailed illustrations including covers for Gowans’ playbooksThe Death of Tintagiles(1909),Alladine and Palomides(1911), andThe Intruder(1913), and other books, as well as her own works of illustrations:Dwellings of an Old World Town(1909), andKirkcudbright, A Royal Burgh(1934).

The publisher T. N. Foulis marketed their books as crafted works of art in their own right (quality publisher’s bindings being relatively new in this period) and Jessie’s work certainly helped that vision become a reality.

Jessie worked for other publishers as well, including internationally, especially illustrating short stories. You can explore one of these here, a French version of Kipling's short story 'An Habitation Enforced'.

Jessie also designed jewellery for Liberty of London.

She also designed ceramics, such as this pot featuring the Selkirk grace (a popular grace in Scotland written here in a mixture of Scots and English) the design speaks to her later more colourful style.

Jessie's interdisciplinarity and ability to work in mixed media was typical of the ‘Glasgow style’, an art and design movement so-called due to its association with the Glasgow School of Art.

It was a holistic ‘total design’ movement encompassing many disciplines. It built upon the earlier Arts and Crafts, belonging to the contemporary Art Nouveau and Jugendstil, and was an influence upon the art movements yet to come, such as Art Deco, Dutch de Stijl, and Bauhaus.

The artists most commonly associated with the style were the Glasgow Four: Charles Rennie Mackintosh, his wife Margaret MacDonald, her sister Frances MacDonald and Frances' husband James Hebert McNair. Often these artists produced work together.

Many other designers worked in the same circle, a number of them were women. The female artists make up the 'Glasgow girls', though ladies might be a more appropriate term - some of the group, Jessie included, formed a society called the Glasgow Society of Lady Artists. However, the name the 'Glasgow girls' was coined in response to the 'Glasgow boys', a group of celebrated male Scottish modernist painters working in an overlapping period who received somewhat more scholarly attention in subsequent years than the ladies working predominantly in craft and design.

The success of the Glasgow style was thanks in no small part to the director of the Glasgow School of Art Francis (Fra) Henry Newbery who encouraged practising artists to teach at the school. His own wife, Jessi Newbery was one of the 'Glasgow Girls'.

Fra Newbery was particularly good at bringing promising students together in collaborations, not just the Glasgow Four but also Jessie, her friend Helen Paxton Brown, and her designer husband E.A. Taylor, with whom she later lived in this house in Kirkcudbright, Dumfries and Galloway. Kirkcudbright was the centre of a vibrant artists community and a community of practising female artists (Greengate close coterie) of which Jessie was the central figure.

Jessie contributed internationally to the popularity of the 'Scottish School' of Art Nouveau winning the Turin gold medal for her book design in 1901. The certificate called her Mr (Signor) Jessie King as there was no precedent for a woman to be awarded such an honour.

The story of Jessie M. King is one of collaboration with peers, especially other female artists, and is closely linked to the successes of the 'Scottish school' of designers in the Art Nouveau movement. It is, however, also a story where Jessie is recognised as an internationally renowned artist and pioneer in her own right.

Sybil the Designer

Sybil's signature fabrics

The women that wore her designs

Sybil - the entrepreneur

Forging a path for Irish designers

Irish fashion designer Sybil Connolly (24 January 1921 - 6 May 1998) put Ireland on the international fashion map in the 1950s. A true entrepreneur, Sybil brought Irish fabrics to the fore, using traditional baínín wool, tweed, flannel, crochet and linen in her innovative couture designs.

The story of Sybil Connolly's success was unique especially as her rise to fame occurred in the Irish economic and social environment of the 1950-60s.

Then, Ireland was far from the world fashion capitals in both distance and influence. Ireland was still a relatively new state, under the strong influence of the church and, although modernising, the population was still largely rural.

However, Sybil was always metropolitan in her outlook and held a strong belief that Ireland and an Irish woman could compete on the world stage. With this belief and a dedication to Irish fabrics, she would go on to design couture lines that championed Irish design.1

Sybil Connolly was born in Wales to Irish and English parents. She began an apprenticeship aged 17 at Irish run company Bradley & Co based in London. She even assisted at royal fittings at Buckingham Palace.

Sybil eventually returned to Ireland in 1940 to work at Richard Alan, a leading ladies' fashion house in Dublin. Sybil's fashion success began when in 1952 she became the head designer at Richard Alan. This was her first couture line. The inspiration for the collection was simplyIreland, influenced by traditional Irish garments made in traditional fabrics.

The success of this first collection was aided by some other influential Irish women and some serendipitous encounters.

Carmel Snow, the Irish born editor of Harper's Bazaar, was instrumental in convincing thePhiladelphia Fashion Groupto travel to Dublin to see the first fashion show by Sybil Connolly. Dunsany Castle was the fairytale setting for the fashion show, which was facilitated by another formidable woman, Lady Dunsany. Support from Eleanor Lambert, an American publicist and long time friend of Sybil cemented her success in the lucrative US market.

The significance of this coverage of Irish design and fabrics at the time was truly remarkable and should be justly remembered. The momentum continued and, in 1956, the March cover of Harper's Bazaar had the title 'Spring Collections Paris, London, Dublin, Italy', indicating that the fashion world would await the collections coming out of Dublin as much as those coming from Paris or Milan.

The success of her first collection and the acceptance of vernacular traditional Irish fabrics ensured that her dedication to these fabrics.

Her dedication to Irish craft never waivered throughout her career. Donegal embroidery, handwoven Carrickmacross lace, Donegal tweeds, Báinín wool and most notably her own Handkerchief Pleated Linen were incorporated into her designs. She catapulted Irish material and craftwork onto the world fashion stage in a way that was previously unthinkable.

Interestingly, Sybil's dedication to Irish fashion heritage started with a fortuitous meeting with a woman in Connemara, in the West of Ireland.

While travelling through Connemara to source tweed, and taking inspiration from the mountain colours, Sybil stopped her car to give sweets to some children. The children's mother came to the door of her cottage, wearing a wonderful bright, red flannel skirt. She pointed Sybil to the village shop where she bought a bale of the Irish fabric. A glorious red evening skirt, teamed with a white Irish linen blouse, modelled by Anne Gunning was the result.

Later that year, Anne Gunning, considered the most beautiful model of the 1950s, graced the cover of Life Magazine under the headline 'Irish Invade Fashion World'.

Sybil would go on to develop a technique of pleating handkerchief linen resulting in exquisite gowns and skirts, that used linen's innate creasing ability to create garments that were uncrushable. She also used perfectly tailored tweed to design couture suits, coats and capes that made it into the pages ofLife Magazine,VogueandHarper's Bazaar.

Sybil continued to support the use of Irish vernacular fabrics such as linen and tweed, as well as lace and crochet. Nearly all of these created by small cottage industry workers. Crochet from women employed in their homes and lace from the nuns at Carrickmacross. Sybil Connolly employed around 100 women craftworkers, many working from home, allowing them to provide, work and care for their families.

Sybil Connolly's life and work tell an important story of the success of an Irish woman and Irish fabrics while, interestingly, also gives insights into the lives of Irish women, from those who were involved in their creation to those who wore and cherished them.

During the 1950s and 1960s, her designs were celebrated across the world, most notably in the United States. Many women wore Sybil Connolly’s designs: from America's first lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis to actresses such as Adele Astaire (in the musicalFunny Face) and Julie Andrews (in the filmThe Sound of Music).

Sybil's signature styles were captured by the top photographers of the time. World renowned fashion photographer Richard Dormer photographed Sybil's white crochet dress and red full length cape for the cover ofLife Magazinein 1953.2

The appreciation and recognition of Sybil's designs continued into the 1960s.

When the prevailing fashion of the 60s began to diverge from Sybil's signature style, her focus shifted from couture fashion to interior design. It is in this part of her life that some contradictions are evident.

Sybil's practiced feminist credentials, of a woman operating in what had been a very male-dominated sector, seemed contrary to her refusal to modernise her designs. Sybil was a shrewd independent and successful business woman but it was probably her conservatism that caused the popularity of her couture line to wane. She did however have the power and imagination to reinvent herself, moving her creativity to interior design products. She collaborated on homeware products with Tiffany, Waterford Crystal, and wallpaper fabric designers Brunschwig & Fils.

The importance of Sybil Connolly in forging a path for Irish Designers and Irish women cannot be underestimated. Sybil Connolly’s contributed to the story of Irish women, exports, textiles, fashion design and social history. Her story is impressive and deserves to be told, as well as her maintaining her legacy.

Finnish photographer Anja Halla’s street photography documents twenty years in the life of a district with wooden houses in Heinola, a town to the north of Helsinki.

The stores of the photographer, clock smith, hairdressers and cloth merchant were in the same building Pietari lived in. The building on the small street did not have any other stores than the small general merchandise store of widow Vetterant. At one end of the building were the blacksmith's workshop and outhouses and, at the other, a room with a stove for Pietari and his father.

Pikku Pietarin piha by Aapeli, 1958

Anja Halla was a photographer for Itä-Häme newspaper from 1963 to 1998. Over the years, she took press photos that told the story of the wooden district of Heinola and how people used to live there.

The houses depicted in her black-and-white photographs are almost exactly the same as those from the novelPikku Pietarin piha(Little Peter's Yard) by newspaper columnistAapeli. The novel is set around a block of wooden houses in the small town of Kuopio.

In this photograph, the K. Markkanen bed linen and textile store on Savontie is having a moving sale. The book shop next to it looks already empty. The Seppäläinen shoe store on Kauppakatu is also having a sale to get rid of its inventory. The writing on the wall says: 'building to be demolished'.

Halla lived through a shift in society. She has experienced and seen a lot. Her photographs tell personal stories from a warm, human perspective. She does not arrange her subjects. Instead, she simply observes and documents.

Anja Halla and her camera were a familiar sight to the people of Heinola, busy with their lives. Here, a boy in the neighbourhood rides his bike and takes a curious glance at Halla and the viewer of the photo while moving forward all the time.

Halla's photos show the town's beautiful porches, decorated windows, stone foundations, inner courtyards and picket fences.

The yard of the rented barracks has a well and clothes lines. The wear and tear of daily life shows. The eaves are crooked, the gutter is broken, the window frames are run down and the paint on the wall is sun-bleached. The walls of snow cover any evidence of the draughty rooms and tuberculosis.

The photographs of the demolition and construction of Heinola were originally  published in Itä-Häme newspaper.

In 1985, Halla assembled an exhibition of lost Heinola at Heinola City Museum.

The black-and-white photos from 1965 to 1985 provide a perspective on a bygone world. The captions show that all of these building were demolished: the marina with its painted walls, the Tuukkanen building, the Paalanen building, Niemelä manor, the Koli block on Harjukatu and the Heinola co-operative building next to the square.

Halla's street photography documents changes in the small town over twenty years, the end of an era. In 2013, 28 years later, the exhibition was again displayed at Heinola City Museum.

Halla's photography remind older generations of how people used to live and tell younger generations a story of a world that no longer exists. The past and the present are linked in an astonishing manner by the photos.

'The friendly living environment of the wooden houses and gardens is now gone' said Halla about the exhibition in an article from 1985, wondering if this is what the people of Heinola really wanted.

This blog was originally published in 2020 for the Finnish magazine of photography 'Kamera'. In 2021, it was published onFinnish Heritage Agency website. All of Anja Halla's images of Heinola can be found onEuropeana.

The lesbian love story at the heart of a Parisian bookstore

The bookshop Shakespeare and Company has been at the heart of the Paris literary scene for decades, particularly during the 1920s and 1930s.

It was set up by American Sylvia Beach who, along with her partner Adrienne Monnier, ran the store until World War II.

Sylvia Beach was born in Baltimore in 1887 and raised in New Jersey. She first visited Europe as a teenager in 1901, when her father, a Presbyterian clergyman, moved the family to Paris, where he worked at an American church.

Sylvia enjoyed life in France and, after having moved back to the United States with her family, decided to return to live there during the last years ofWorld War I. She did volunteer relief work in France and, in 1918–19, served with the American Red Cross in Serbia.

In November 1919, she opened the bookstore Shakespeare and Company. Initially located on rue Dupuytren, it moved to rue de l'Odéon in 1922.

Sensing the need for books in English, Sylvia specialised in selling books published in Great Britain and the United States. This catered for a large American expatriate community in Paris, as well as French customers who had a growing interest in English-language literature.

The bookshop thus became a hub for a generation of American and British writers inParis.

Noted writers such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein and Ezra Pound visited to buy and borrow books and discuss literary matters. Sylvia's store was so well-known among writers, that she began to fund and give loans in French francs to recently-arrived writers who were waiting for their dollars to come through.

In July 1920, Beach met Irish writer James Joyce who had been trying, unsuccessfully, to publish his masterpiece, Ulysses. Sylvia offered to publish it and gained considerable fame and fortune from doing so in 1922.

Down the street on rue de l'Odéon was another bookstore, La Maison des Amis des Livres.

Its owner Adrienne Monnier was Sylvia's partner. Their love story was said to have begun when Sylvia's hat blew away in the wind on rue de l'Odéon, and Adrienne chased after it. 'J'aime beaucoup l'Amérique,' declared Adrienne, to which Sylvia replied, 'J'aime beaucoup la France.'

They were a couple for 36 years until Adrienné's death in 1955.

Shakespeare and Company experienced some financial difficulties during the 1930s but remained supported by wealthy friends. By the end of 1941, with Paris occupied by Nazi Germany during World War II, Sylvia was forced to close the bookstore. She was interned for six months.

In 1944, with Paris liberated, Ernest Hemingway made a point of symbolically liberating Shakespeare and Company, but Sylvia never opened the store again.

Sylvia published her memoirs in 1956 detailing the lives and loves of the vibrant Paris literary scene during the inter-war years. Sylvia died in 1962, survived by Camille Steinbrugge, her partner at the time.

Today, there still is a bookstore in Paris calledShakespeare and Company.

It was opened in 1951 at a different location by American George Whitman. Originally called Le Mistral, he renamed it in 1964 to Shakespeare and Company to honour Sylvia Beach.

Teresa de Cepeda y Ahumada (1515-1582)

Concepción Arenal (1820-1893)

Carolina Coronado (1820-1911)

Sofía Tartilán Rodríguez (1829-1888)

Saints, social reformers, journalists, poets and feminists

Mujeres en la Memoriais a collection of theBiblioteca Virtual del Patrimonio Bibliográficoof the Spanish Ministry of Culture.

It includes more than 1600 works sharing a common theme: women through time. The collection dates from the 12th to the 21st century and is divided into two main sections. One covers bibliographic works: works written by or about women or on subjects of interest to women. The second is made up of graphic works, mostly portraits of great female figures.

The stories and biographies of many great Spanish women can be found - here are seven examples of Spanish female writers.

Nun, mystic and writer, Teresa - who is known as Saint Teresa of Jesus or Saint Teresa of Avila - is considered one of the most exceptional figures of Spanish spirituality.

In the 1560s, she founded the Order of Discalced Carmelites which dedicated its work to spirituality, prayer and poverty. It was recognised as an order by the Pope in 1580.

After her death, she was beatified in 1614, canonised in 1622 and recognised as a doctor of the Catholic Church in 1970.

In her writing, we find lyrical-religious poetry, mystical works and an extensive epistolary production.

Concepción Arenal was a pioneer in Spanish feminism. She was a prison officer, legal expert, journalist, poet and playwright.

From an early age she wanted to become a lawyer, so at the age of 21 she entered the Faculty of Law at the Central University of Madrid as an auditor.

To do so, she had to disguise herself as a man, cutting her hair short, and wearing a frock coat, cape and top hat. When her true identity was discovered, the rector intervened and, after passing an exam, she was authorised to attend classes.

Also dressed as a man, Concepción, with liberal and progressive ideas, took part in political and literary gatherings and contributed to the newspaper La Iberia.

Throughout her life and work, she denounced the situation of men's and women's prisons, the misery in nursing homes and the condition of women in the 19th century. She also defended, through her publications, the work carried out by religious communities in Spain, and contributed toBoletín de la Institución Libre de Enseñanza, an important intellectual journal in Spain.

Carolina Coronado was a Spanish writer and poet of the Romantic period in the 19th century.

Her work is notable for its diversity and versatility in terms of genres and subjects. Her first works were poetic, while she also ventured into other genres, such as prose and theatre, that revealed her versatility. From a thematic point of view, her work is also very diverse: nature, love, civic society and even politics and feminism.

She also published extensively in the contemporary press, using this medium to launch her ideas and reflections on the issues that concerned her: women, politics and the press. Her poetry was initially published in this medium, until it was compiled in a single volume entitledPoesíasin 1843.

Sofía Tartilán Rodríguez was a novelist, essayist and journalist who wrote genre pictures, novels and some books of erudition.

She also contributed to several magazines, such asEl Gran Mundo,La Caza(1865-1868),El Mediodía de Málaga, etc.

A militant feminist, she always advocated better education for women.

María Rosalía Rita de Castro was a Spanish poet and novelist who wrote in both Galician and Spanish.

Writing in Galician at the time when Rosalía lived, the 19th century, was not easy. Partly due to the way of thinking and the structure of society at the time, the Galician language was highly discredited and undervalued, whereas Spanish was the language of culture.

However, Rosalía de Castro gave prestige to Galician by using it in her workCantares gallegos, thus consolidating the cultural revival of the language.

A year before her death, she published her last book of poems, entitledEn las orillas del Sar. This book had a tragic tone, marked by the harsh circumstances surrounding the last years of her life. It is considered by different scholars as the main poetic creation of the 19th century.

Emilia Serrano was a writer, journalist and passionate traveller, who corresponded with great writers of the time. Her letters are essential for our knowledge of the literary life of the 19th century.

As a writer she was the author of works on history and education and edited the newspapersLa CaprichosaandLa Nueva Caprichosa. She also collaborated in other publications such asEco Ferrolano,El Último FigurínandEl Correo de la Moda.

Emilia Pardo Bazán was an aristocratic novelist, journalist, essayist, literary critic, poet, playwright, translator, editor, Spanish professor and lecturer who introduced naturalism in Spain.

She dedicated her life to defending women's rights, both in her daily life and in her literary works. One example isLa dama joven(1885), in which she speaks of marital crises, just at the moment when she begins to separate from her husband.

One of her best known works is the novelLos pazos de Ulloa(1886), which established her as one of the great writers of Spanish literature. In it, she describes the decadence of the landed oligarchy which has lost its social leadership role. It is a pathetic depiction of the decadence of the aristocracy in the Galician rural world.

These seven women are just a few examples of the many more that can be discovered inMujeres en la Memoria.

A quest for a more enjoyable cup of coffee

From a school notebook to a patent bulletin

Growing a thriving family business

How a housewife from Dresden revolutionised the way we drink coffee

If you are a coffee drinker, you have most likely tried filter coffee. Enthusiasts of this way of brewing appreciate it for its clean, clear and consistent flavour. Make yourself a nice cup of coffee and read the story of the inventor of the coffee filter Melitta Bentz. This is a story about persistence, solving problems through trial and error and women's entrepreneurship in the early 20th century.

Amalie Auguste Melitta Liebscher was born on 31 January 1873 in Dresden into a family of entrepreneurs. Her father was a publisher and a bookseller, and her grandparents owned a brewery.

At the end of the 1890s, she fell in love and married Johannes Emil Hugo Bentz, a small business owner. We don't know much about her education. She was a housewife, ran a household and took care of her husband and their children: two sons, Willy and Horst, and daughter Herta.

We also know that Melitta started her days with a cup of coffee, which left her with a bitter taste on her lips. Or with grounds in her mouth. The standard brewing methods in her time were porcelain percolators or fabric filters. These produced over-brewed coffee that often contained grounds floating in the cup. This was a shared experience the rest of the world accepted - but not Melitta.

She knew there must be a way to create a clear and flavourful cup of coffee. So she decided to find it. That’s how she started her quest for a more enjoyable cup of coffee through trial and error, testing all kinds of materials and techniques. One day, she came up with a solution which produced a clean and tasty brew.

The material that helped Melitta Bentz obtain a particle-free brew was blotting paper from her eldest son's school notebook. She pierced holes in the bottom of a brass pot and put the paper over it. She was happy with the taste of the coffee prepared this way.

She showed her discovery to her friends. Encouraged by their enthusiasm and aware of the great potential of her idea, she decided to bring her invention to the market and filed for a patent.

On 20 June 1908, the Imperial Patent Office granted her utility model protection for her round filter with prefabricated filter paper. The patent was officially published in the “Patentblatt” (patent bulletin) in July 1908.

Melitta started her company 'M. Bentz' in a room of her family's apartment with a starting capital of 72 pfennigs. Melitta's husband and sons were the company's first employees.

The business flourished and within a few years received a gold medal at the International Hygiene Exhibition in Dresden. The apartment became too small for the thriving company. It moved to new headquarters in Dresden and started hiring employees beyond family members.

During World War I, paper became a scarce commodity and the import of coffee beans was banned by the German government. The production of filters had to be put on hold: Melitta decided to start producing cardboard boxes in order to survive. She ran the business all by herself as her husband was called to duty.

When the war was over, the production of filters resumed and the company started to quickly expand again. In 1925, Melitta launched its typical red and green packs to make the brand easy to recognise and to protect itself from numerous imitators. In the 1930s, the company’s ownership was passed to Melitta's two sons.

Today, it is still a family business. Over time, it has become a global company - all from the experiments of Melitta Bentz.

Four short films exploring the history and future of lace

How lace-making is interwoven into European history

Lace is among the most fascinating items we can focus on when it comes to fashion heritage. There is no doubt that lace was - and arguably still is - something that can embody the spirit and changing nature of fashion itself.

Lace is the material result of the encounter of sharp minds and skillful hands.  Techniques to produce lace have developed since the 16th century, when it is said that lace was'invented' in Venice, as a real labour of love.

Retracing the history of lace means rediscovering the history of Europe, and the history of women's work and emancipation. It is woven through the histories of globalisation and industrialisation, and those of class, gender and power dynamics.

Four short films from the CRAFTED project explore these histories of lace.

We venture into the rich cultural heritage of lace in Bruges and Antwerp, guided by the knowledge and connections ofMoMu Antwerp, the most important museum of the region when it comes to liaising past, present and future in fashion.

In collaboration with the museum, these four new episodes of the #craftingheritage vlog series showcase the intricate relationship between the craft of lacemaking and the region between Bruges and Antwerp, understanding how passionate people have managed to turn a tradition into a teaching tool to engage with citizens of many ages.

In the first episode, titledGaming Lace / Play, teach, value: resilient crafts in Bruges, Rudy De Nolf, manager of the Lace Centre & Museum in Bruges, explains how he turned traditional techniques into an enjoyable and shared learning experience.

Lace-making has become a game which teaches the value of heritage, and here Bruges’ long and illustrious tradition of lace making becomes the key to showing children how to embed craft in their future - and therefore the future of the world.

Two episodes -Archiving Lace, Crafting History Part 1andArchiving Lace, Crafting History Part 2- narrate the history of lace and its relationship to Antwerp (and Europe, of course!) via some of the most fashionable gems housed in MoMU's collections.

Frieda Sorber, curator and expert on the history of lace, takes us through a chronological journey to marvel at the minutiae of lace, from the origins of the craft and commercial evolution up to the 17th century, moving into the translation from hands to machines, and the spirit of revivalism of more recent examples of lace-making.

Heritage and craft, for us, is also about the future. So we asked: can lace be the textile of the future?

The 2021 exhibition ‘P.LACE.S - Looking through Antwerp Lace’ expressed MoMu's take on the topic, demonstrating once again how the museum performs as an incubator of new ideas and experiments, fostering the development of cutting-edge collaborations, merging memories and aspirations and crafting the future.

In the fourth video of the series, titledLace 3.0: The Arts and Craft of 3D Printing / Cutting-edge technologies to shape new museological practices, curator Romy Cockx talks about the process of curating the show and selects one very special object to demonstrate how lace is indeed something that can represent the resilience of history and its centrality in the evolution of techniques and establishment of new, meaningful crafts: a 3D-printed handkerchief inspired by the one depicted by Peter Paul Rubens in 1615.

We are very grateful to the many knowledgeable voices that guide us down a fascinating route to discover how cultural heritage can indeed be both a repository and source for the development of new artistic and productive languages, as well as serving as springboards to craft shared moments of enjoyment and creative expression.

The videos were produced by EFHA - European Fashion Heritage Association in collaboration with MoMu - Fashion Museum Antwerp as part of the Europeana Crafted series.



This blog was written as part of theCRAFTED project, which aimed to enrich and promote traditional and contemporary crafts.

Strike in London for the rights of women and migrant workers

In the late 1970s, an industrial dispute in London had a lasting impact on labour relations in the UK. The Grunwick dispute focused on a film processing laboratory in Willesden and its mostly Asian and female workforce.

In the summer of 1976 - the hottest summer on record thus far - a strike began when, on Friday 20 August, Grunswick dismissed Devshi Bhudia for working too slowly. Three colleagues, Chandrakant Patel, Bharat Patel and Suresh Ruparelia, walked out in support of him. Later that day, Jayaben Desai put on her coat to leave and was dismissed for doing so. By the following Monday, that small group of people began picketing the premises and were joined by other colleagues.

The strike quickly spread and by the end of the year, more than 200 workers were involved.

The workers at Grunwick were predominantly women and mostly of East African Asian origin. The company frequently employed people who had just moved to London and were unlikely to be aware of their rights.

They were protesting against poor working conditions and low pay at the company. The average wage at the company was significantly below the national average, and overtime was compulsory. Many of the workers were not members of trade unions, which nonetheless were not recognised by their employers. This lack of union recognition and refusal to negotiation led to the strike becoming more widespread.

The strike gained media attention and became a major cause celebre in the UK, with thousands of people demonstrating in support of the workers. Jayaben Desai became a well-known figurehead of the protests. She was a confident and inspiring speaker, highlighting the racist and sexist comments aimed at her and at the other striking workers.

The workers were supported by a number of trade unions, including the Trade Union Congress (TUC) and the Association of Professional, Executive, Clerical and Computer Staff (APEX), which organised a series of strikes and boycotts in support of the Grunwick workers.

The dispute became increasingly bitter and confrontational, particularly during the summer of 1977, with picket lines being set up outside the Grunwick plant and violent clashes between the police and striking workers. More than 500 people were arrested.

The company's refusal to negotiate with the workers or their representatives led to the strike dragging on for almost two years. Various legal actions and government interventions took place, with a government inquiry report recommending that the mass picketing be wound down and that Grunwick should recognise a trade union.

With Conservative and right-wing politicians giving their support to the Grunswick employers, by the end of 1977, the trade unions believed the dispute could not be won, and withdrew their support. Jayaben Desai and a number of strikers disputed this and mounted a hunger strike outside the TUC headquarters in November 1977.

The strike was effectively over by early 1978, but it was only officially called off in July 1978. None of the workers' demands had been met.

Although the strike had not been successful, today, Grunwick is remembered for how thousands of workers, men and women from all races, united to defend the rights of migrant women workers. In the 1970s, trade unions were all led by white men: women workers as well as non-white workers often found it very hard to win support from their unions.

'We have shown', Jayaben Desai said, 'that workers like us, new to these shores, will never accept being treated without dignity or respect.'

Beryl Gilroy

Simone Schwarz-Bart

Ellen Ombre

Three women writing Caribbean and European stories

Beryl Gilroy, Simone Schwarz-Bart and Ellen Ombre are three authors who explore the themes of migration, representation, identity and the complex relationship with home in their literary works. Each of these women discuss their relationships with the Caribbean and their lives in Europe through their stories connecting them to womanhood, Black and Caribbean experiences and history.

Beryl Agatha Gilroy was a Guyanese educator, novelist, poet and ethno-physiotherapist. She grew up in the care of her maternal grandparents. Her grandfather taught her to read and her herbalist grandmother would tell her folkloric tales and proverbs. She trained to be a teacher in Georgetown, earning her diploma in 1945. As part of the Windrush generation, she emigrated to London in 1951 and gained a diploma in child development from the University of London.

Finding a teaching job in London was difficult due to racist stereotyping of Black and Caribbean people by employers. To support herself, she worked as a maid in a mail order factory and as a dishwasher in a café. She became the first Black female teacher in London when she was eventually employed by the Inner London Education Authority in 1951. In 1969, she  was the first Black person to be a head teacher at a London school.

Her early works analyse the impact of life in Britain on families from the West Indies, while her later writing explores issues of African and Caribbean diaspora and slavery. While at home with her children between 1956 and 1968, she began writing the first children's series on Black British presence in London. Her bookNew People at Twenty-Fourdiscussed interracial marriage and was a first for a children’s book by an author of any race.

Though completed in 1959, her first novelIn Praise of Love and Childrenwas published over 30 years later in 1994. Publishers claimed that they found it strange, difficult to categorise, psychological and too colonial. However, her male counterparts such as Caribbean writers Sam Selvon and George William Lamming thrived. She was supported by writer Andrew Salkey who would often offer assistance and encouragement to women writers.

In her 1976 memoirBlack Teacher, she wrote about her experience as a Black female teacher in an effort to also give a woman’s perspective alongside books likeTo Sir, With Loveby E. R. Braithwaite. She was accused of exaggerating the prejudice she experienced and of boasting, while Braithwaite’s account of his success was more accepted.

By the 1980s, publishing opportunities were more easily accessible for women, which helped Gilroy's works to be read and acknowledged. In 1986, Gilroy gave a talk at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London on the topic ofchildhood, identity and old agediscussed in her novelFrangipani House.

Scholars in the 21st century now consider Beryl Gilroy to have written at ‘the wrong time’ and of the ‘wrong gender’, a victim of the racism and sexism of the times when she was active.

Simone Schwarz-Bart is a Guadeloupean French novelist and playwright.  While studying in Paris, aged 18, she met French Jewish novelist André Schwarz-Bart who would later become her husband. He encouraged her to pursue writing. At various times in their lives, they lived in Paris, Senegal, Switzerland and Guadeloupe.

Together with her husband in 1967, she wroteUn plat de porc aux bananes verteswhich explores the similarities in Caribbean and Jewish exile. They also wroteLa Mulâtresse Solitudein 1972 inspired by the life of historical Guadeloupean heroine figure Solitude.

In Praise of Black Womenwas published in 1989, a six-volume encyclopaedia honouring Black women from the ancient past to the present who were absent in the official historiography.

In 1972, she wrotePluie et vent sur Télumée Miracle, one of the masterpieces of Caribbean literature. It is an important novel for the representation of Guadeloupean women in French literature.

Critics have often attributed full authorship to her husband despite her being mentioned as a collaborator in their works. However, in the English translation ofLa Mulâtresse Solitude, she is acknowledged as an author.

Ellen Louise Ombre is a Dutch writer of Surinamese descent who came to the Netherlands in 1961 with her parents. She first worked as a medical social worker and, by 1992, made her literary debut.Maalstroomconsists of short stories about Surinamese people and their experiences living abroad.

Two years later she publishedVrouwvreemd('Woman Strange') which also consists of short stories about displacement.

Similar themes can be found in her 1996 workWie Goed Bedoelt('With the best intentions') which is an autobiographical travel report and an observation on Benin and Dutch Development Aid.

In her 2000 bookFalse Desires, she explores the historical gold trade routes, enslaved people and arms in the Netherlands, West Africa and the Caribbean. Through the series of short stories, she highlights its contemporary legacy leaving disillusionment and unattainable desires and the Surinamese, Dutch and African search for money, love and happiness.

Since then she has written books exploring Caribbean and Jewish mixed identities, and continues to write about identity, heritage and Dutch modern or historical issues.

Woking - a town in England 50 kilometres southwest of London - is home to what is believed to be the United Kingdom's first purpose-built mosque.

The Shah Jahan Mosque was commissioned in 1889 by Dr Gottlieb Wilhelm Leitner.

Leitner, who had been born in Budapest to a Jewish family, established a centre in Woking in 1881 (then known as the Oriental Institute) for the study of Middle Eastern and Asian languages, culture and history. Leitner later commissioned the mosque for the benefit of Muslim students studying there.

The mosque was the first formal place of Islamic worship in England. It was designed by architect William Isaac Chambers in a Persian-Saracenic Revival style. It features a dome, minarets and a courtyard.

Leitner died in 1899. The mosque was not used between then and 1913. Its fortunes were revived by the Woking Mosque Trust who took over the running of the place of worship.

Its from this period that many photographs on Europeana show the life and activities of the mosque. British photojournalists in the 1910s capture events, festivities and worship at the mosque.

In October 1916, worshippers and guests gathered at the mosque to celebrate Eid al-Adha, the Feast of Sacrifice, while in 1917, people are seen marking Eid al-Fitr at the end of Ramadhan. These photographs were made by the Alfieri Picture Service.

Two decades later, in March 1936, a photographer from Planet News took this image of the festival of Eid al-Adha being celebrated at the mosque.

For several decades, until the arrival of Pakistani immigrants to the UK in the 1960s, the Mosque was the centre of Islam in Britain.

Although the mosque has been renovated several times, it continues to be a symbol of Islamic community in Britain.

Halberstadt is a city in Germany, with a long Jewish history stretching back centuries. In the early 18th century, its Jewish community was one of the largest in Central Europe and the city was known as a centre of theology.

A formal written order of protection is the earliest documented evidence of Jewish life in Halberstadt in the Middle Ages. In the writ, issued by Bishop Voldrad von Kranichfeld along with the city council in 1261, the city promises to protect the Jews as it has done ‘in the past’

After theThirty Years Warwhen Halberstadt became part ofBrandenburg-Prussia, more knowledge on Jewish life surfaces. By late 1641 there were almost complete preservations of artefacts from the Jewish Community of Halberstadt.

In 1650, the Great Elector Frederick William issued a decree that allowed Jews in Halberstadt to engage in trade, to butcher ‘according to their custom’ and to maintain a synagogue.

In 1669, the synagogue was destroyed and the Jewish community sued the city of Halberstadt. The Great Elector Frederick William allowed an investigation. In the end, the city of Halberstadt had to pay compensation to the community. It remains unclear if another synagogue was built right after or if religious services were held in private rooms.

In the 1680s, Berend Lehmann (1661-1730) originally from the Prince-Bishopric of Essen, moved to Halberstadt. He had married Mirjam, the daughter of the deceased local Court Jew Alexander Joel. Court Jews were Jewish money lenders who financed European royalty and the nobility, as well as providers of luxury goods, advisors in questions of reorganising the administration, and diplomats.
Starting in 1691, Lehmann was registered in the lists of Jews mentioned in the above picture as the owner of his own writ of protection. He is considered to be one of the most important Court Jews of his day.

From Halberstadt, he set up connections to the courts of Brandenburg-Prussia, Hanover, Brunswick and Saxony. As was typical of Court Jews, Lehmann also promoted Judaism. He supported both the local community and German-speaking Jews beyond Halberstadt. Among other things, he financed the first complete printing of the Babylonian Talmud (religious text and centrepiece of Jewish cultural life ) in Germany between 1696 and 1699. It was printed in Frankfurt (Oder) and he donated half of the copies to educational institutions free of charge.

Around 1700 the Klaus was built and was founded by Lehmann. It was a place of learning where two or three distinguished Rabbis would be able to study, teach and publish, free of any duties in the community. In 1857, Joseph Hirsch, a successful businessman, arranged to modernise the existing building of the Klaus, and an additional part was built. It included a beth midrash (a hall dedicated for Torah study), and a study centre with a library, which was connected to a prayer room, stretching over two stories. It was in use until 1938.

Financing synagogues was also quite common among Court Jews and thanks to Lehmann, a new Baroque Synagogue (located between the streets Bakenstraße and Judenstraße) was completed for the community around 1712. The synagogue was inspired by the royal court in Dresden and was considered to be the most beautiful Baroque Synagogue in the German realm. The community paid 6,000 taler, a loan from Lehmann; the yearly interest paid went to support scholars at the Klaus.

The two oldest Jewish cemeteries ‘Am Roten Strumpf’ and ‘Am Berge’ lie just outside of the medieval city wall close to the former Jewish quarter.

Burials took place there since the middle of the 17th century. Lehmann's gravestone is preserved, and it praises his generosity as a community benefactor. The Halberstadt Jewish cemeteries are a unique testimony to the important community and its burial culture rooted in Neo-Orthodoxy.

Tradition and politics in the designs of Yugoslavia's leading designer

Aleksandar Joksimović was one of the most famous designers in Yugoslavia, known not only for his designs, but above all for his ability to conjugate traditions and innovation.

The 1960s have always been considered a burgeoning era of social change. Fashion was an integral part of a progressive movement - and indeed was used to react to the poverty and difficulties of the previous decades and demonstrate new ways to negotiate people's identity, both individually and as nations.

This is not only true for the more known - and studied - areas of the world: we all can make up an image of what the London scene would have looked like during the swinging years, thanks to the many movies, accounts, books and ephemera related to that moment.

But the London scene was not the only one that housed a stylistic revolution. Indeed, the Yugoslav fashion scene was as ebullient with new ideas, and this is mainly thanks to designer Aleksandar Joksimović.

Born in 1933, Joksimović briefly studied scenography, to then graduate in 1958 in textile design from the College of Applied Arts in Novi Sad.

His political commitment was manifest from the very start of his career. At the beginning of the 1960s, he was employed as designer of work uniforms for the City of Belgrade Institute for Household Improvement. Joksimović engaged with the everyday management of the Institute, and was one of the founders of its National Salon, a place for fashion to be showcased and appreciated.

Fashion's calling arrived, and he gleefully responded, designing his first evening wear collection in 1963. His designs were praised by critics, whose comments gave great visibility to Joksimović’s work, making him one of the most prominent personalities in the Yugoslavian fashion system.

In 1964, he started working with the Centrotekstil, Yugoslavia's export-import giant, and his designs became even more popular. He managed to keep his role as head designer within the National Salon: his designs were appreciated both by the market and by the political powers, since they came from the encounter of fashionable cuts and shapes with traditional motifs and decorations.

Always very attentive to the social scenario in which he was operating, Joksimović was successful in understanding the social changes that were happening in Yugoslavia.

He catered to the rising wealthier middle class, while paying respect to the state ideology, including details from folk costumes in his creations. His womenswear and menswear collections, presented together, featured modern designs while still including traditional motifs and craft techniques - and his promotional images often showcased monuments and architecture associated with the political power of the time.

The peak of his success is represented by three collections, shown between 1967 and 1969:Simonides,Stained Glass and LandscapeandJerina.

Simonides was the first 'haute couture' collection of socialist Yugoslavia. It was presented to the Belgrade audience on 7 March 1967. The collection featured pearls, complex embroidery and prints together with simple, neat cuts, with more constructed bell sleeves, inspired by medieval Byzantine clothing and Serbian traditional attire.

Stained glass and Landscape took inspiration from the coloured glass windows with Orthodox and Catholic monasteries. The collection was showcased in the exhibition hall of the Belgrade Fair, and it was also screened in Zagreb and Ljubljana.

Jerina, presented in 1969, included reference to the latest designs by Pierre Cardin, but was described as an ode to the legendary construction of the city of Smederevo. It demonstrated how the designer was aligning the meaning of his collections to the promotion of the state put in action by the political class.

All three collections were featured in many western fashion magazines, marking a radical change of the concept of high fashion in socialist Yugoslavia.

In 2005, Aleksandar Joksimović donated documentation about his work to theMuseum of Applied Art in Belgrade, which dedicated a show to the designer and his legacy in 2015.

Later years and legacy

Music and migration in the 20th century

Polish composer Andrzej Panufnik stands among the few composers who, having achieved national fame, decided to emigrate and start their career almost anew in another country. However, when freedom is at stake – as was the case in communist-ruled Poland in the 1950s – even the benefits received from the state seem worthless, especially considering the composer's rich biography.

Panufnik's grandmother, Henryka Thonnes, who was an important figure in his childhood years, claimed to be of English descent, but there is no evidence to prove it (some researchers suggest that her ancestors might have been Scandinavian). Even if that's the reason why the composer chose the United Kingdom as his refuge, he didn't look for any relatives, as there are virtually no 'Thonnes' in UK archives.

In his student years, Andrzej Panufnik made several trips across 1930s Europe, studying conducting with the great Felix Weingartner in Vienna and visiting Paris, just like many of his Polish contemporaries. In France, he experiencedjoi de vivreto such an extent that he could barely stand (and wasn't able to work anymore because of the noise his neighbours made). In Austria – by contrast – Panufnik witnessed brutal force and opportunism in reaction to Nazi German Anschluss and Hitler parades. When leaving for Austria in 1937, Panufnik reminisced:

The railway station evoked my childhood memories and my notorious vagaries from school (I didn't dare to show up to teachers as I was always rehearsing piano instead of doing homework). I used to buy platform tickets and touched – even caressed – wonderful long-haul trains with exciting cards like Warsaw–Berlin–Paris or Warsaw–Amsterdam or Warsaw-Geneva–Rome, dreaming that may be one day I’d become one of these bustling passengers and a train would take me to those unknown lands.

Andrzej Panufnik,Composing Myself, London, 1987

Tadeusz Panufnik, the composer's father, was an engineer, but he found his true passion in violin making – his collection of string instruments became famous in the 1930s and he run not only a little factory, but also a luthier school. As a true renaissance man, he became interested in music theory and number symbolism – elements that could also be traced in his son's mature works, for example in his last symphony (no. 10).

Long before that, Andrzej became a master of string instruments – just like his father – and tried his best to find an original style. In the meantime, however, he had to survive World War II and the German occupation of Poland. Because of the fact that musical activities were heavily restricted, Panufnik focused on composing at home. He often drew from Polish folklore and wrote several songs for the Polish resistance movement (includingWarsaw Children).

He also formed a very successful piano duo with Witold Lutosławski, performing covers, variations and jazz improvisations in cafés. His only brother was killed by a bomb in their family home in the Warsaw Uprising. However, Panufnik lost more than that – even though his scores survived the fights and fires, the new tenant of the apartment where they were stored did not recognise their value and simply threw them away.

Panufnik had to start his work from scratch, not for the last time. He reconstructed some of his pre-war pieces – like theTragic Ouverture– but later focused on old Polish music and folklore, which had sparked his interest already during the German occupation.

He reflected the symmetric paper-cut patterns of Northern Polish art inSinfonia Rustica, used traditional dances in theOld Polish Suiteand wroteConcerto in modo anticofor a documentary film by Veit Stoss about a famous 15th century altar. Soon, this direction turned out to be a safe harbour from the dangerous waves of 'social realist' aesthetics favoured by the state and consisting of propaganda texts, simple harmony and grandiose orchestration. Some of his works conform this official style however – like the monumentalPeace Symphonylater revised asSinfonia Elegiaca– and so Panufnik grew to become one of most important Polish composers of the 1950s.

His high position and handsomeness drew the attention of a young and beautiful Irish woman, Marie Elizabeth O’Hanney, nicknamed Scarlett after the heroine ofGone with the Wind. She came to Poland after World War II as an army officer's widow and seduced many men, before eventually becoming Andrzej's wife and encouraging him to lead a rich social life.

At the same time, the communist authorities needed Panufnik to establish their new order and legitimise it abroad. He became the vice-chairman of the Polish Composers Union and took part in countless conferences and foreign missions, for example to China in 1953.

During this last journey, he received the message that his daughter Oonagh drowned in a bathtub, apparently because of Scarlett having an epileptic attack. Furthermore, the attitude of the ministry's deputies towards the composer was ambiguous. Many of his praised works were banned from concert halls (for exampleSinfonia Rustica), which was a sign of the times. All that – together with limited time for composing and restrictions on artistic freedom – drove Panufnik to desperate measures in 1954.

It is not easy for a man to cut himself from his country and his people. It is perhaps even more difficult for one who, like myself, has made a certain name there and received recognition as a creative artist. But freedom counts for much, and indeed is so important, particularly for the artist, that life without it becomes almost unbearable. This is the case in Poland today. (…) The worker is asked only to use his lathe and peasant his plough; but the artist must subordinate his imagination and individuality to the demands of the Communist Party and create – if he wants to live at all – in a manner that serves the ends of the Communist State.

Andrzej Panufnik,A Composer's View of Life in Modern Poland. I – Hatred of Russian Control, in The Times, 12 August 1954.

At first, Scarlett was reluctant to give up the privileges (including an apartment and a car) granted to them in Poland, but ultimately played a crucial role in the escape plan. Officially, she left to visit her family living in the UK, but the main purpose of her journey was to make arrangements with the Foreign Office and contact composer Konstanty Regamey in Switzerland.

He arranged an official invitation from the Swiss Radio Orchestra for Panufnik to conduct and record his own pieces – a letter which Polish authorities couldn't ignore. The composer had to leave almost all of his belongings behind (including his father's instrument collection) in order to avoid arousing suspicion. Also, he couldn't share his motives with the people closest to him (including his beloved niece, the daughter of his late brother).

When Panufnik came to Switzerland, he was under the surveillance of Polish embassy workers. On the second day, he managed to shake them off by leaving a restaurant through the back door and rushing to the hotel in a taxi. Regamey succeeded in delivering a plane ticket to London and drove the composer to the airport. At last, Andrzej Panufnik joined Scarlett on 14 July 1954.

Although he became quite recognisable after several interviews and newspaper articles describing cultural life behind the Iron Curtain, it soon became clear that he had to start over once again. Year after year, he slowly – but consequently – established his position in British musical life, mostly thanks to his conducting skills and new acquaintances.

His marriage broke down as a result of personality differences. Soon after, Scarlett published her memoirs on Warsaw and Andrzej's escape under the meaningful titleEscape out of City of Fear. After the divorce, the composer met other women, including the love of his life, Camilla Jessel, a young, independent photographer and traveller from a distinguished English family. As Panufnik recounts in his autobiography, he proposed to her after seeing a powerful oak at a car ride.

Trees and nature were one of the key inspirations also for his music. It is clearly visible inArbor cosmicafor 12 string instruments or a string orchestra, which – like many of his mature works – has a single 'root' cell of the notes that appears in twelve variations orEvocations, as they are named in the score.

The newlyweds received a valuable gift from Camilla’s mother: Riverside House in Twickenham, a wonderful 18th century residence in need of a careful restoration. There the Panufniks found their home – the surrounding nature and the shore of the river Thames had a great impact on the composer’s creativity. He loved to go on walks to think, and he frequently transcribed the process into music, for example in the orchestral, impressionisticNocturnefrom 1947 created during a night stroll in Kraków or in the cloudy, microtonalLullabywritten during his stay in London after he was moved by Thames in moonlight.

Twenty years after that, Panufnik wroteLandscapefor string orchestra as a homage to the melancholic flatlands of Poland and Suffolk with references to a Masovian folk song. Such traces of history and tradition were a permanent part of his music in the 1950s and 1960s, and can be found – for example – in the hymnBogurodzicainSinfonia sacra, in some dances in theRhapsodyand in theKatyń Epitaph, dedicated to army officers who were executed by the Soviets in 1940.

Later, the composer felt the need to abandon these references and create more universal works. The symmetry and basic simple cells (like the three notes f-b-e) that resulted from this change became a trademark of his mature output although Polish folklore themes still appeared in many of his works).

The title of Andrzej Panufnik’s autobiography –Composing Myself– is strikingly true to life.

He had to start over at least twice: in 1945, after he lost of all of his pieces during World War II, in 1954 after emigrating from Poland to Great Britain, and – to some extent – in 1968, when he invented his 'geometrical' musical language based on simple cells, main intervals, figures and symmetry. The decision to leave his homeland was not only painful, but also sealed his musical fate in Poland, as Panufnik’s name virtually disappeared from festivals and lexicons until the late 1970s. The instruments carefully designed by his father remain lost, his nephew was expelled from his studies, while the press accused Andrzej himself of betrayal and thievery.

However, some independently thinking artists remembered his music, which helped it reappear in concert programs in the last decade of the Polish communist state. It was only when Andrzej Panufnik made a great come back to his homeland for the 1990 Warsaw Autumn festival that the realms of his life and work joined into one. It happened to be just one year before Sir Andrzej Panufnik passed away in Twickenham – loved and fulfilled, with two children and a knighthood from the country where he had made his new home.

The Dutch tradition of displaying poems on streets and walls

When you visit cities in the Netherlands, you can expect to see canals, quaint streets lined with brick buildings and many, many bicycles. But one Dutch urban tradition may surprise you: displaying poetry on city walls.

The Dutch tradition muurgedichten is a way of bringing poems to streets, displaying their texts on posters, billboards or often built into the very fabric of buildings. These cultural expressions  can add historic or social context to the Dutch cityscapes, or provide a sense of community and identity for cities and their residents.

The tradition is believed to have originated in the 1970s, when poets and artists in Amsterdam started writing and painting poems on the walls of the city as a way to make poetry more accessible to the general public.

The wall poetry tradition has since spread to other cities in the Netherlands. Wall poems can be found on a variety of surfaces, including brick walls, storefronts and even traffic signs. The poems are often written in Dutch, but may also be written in other languages.

In 1992, Leiden was the first city to adopt an official approach tomuurgedichten. The first poem displayed was by Marina Tsvetaeva. By 2005, a hundred poems were displayed on Leiden's streets, including work by William Shakespeare, Langston Hughes, Pablo Neruda, Sappho and William Butler Yeats.

Many wall poems by established poets are created, as well offering the opportunity to aspiring writers and artists to share their work with the public. The tradition is supported by a number of organisations and festivals in the Netherlands - such asPoëzieweek(Poetry Week) which is held in January / February - and is an important part of the country's literary and artistic culture.

Beyond the Netherlands, other countries share the tradition of displaying poetry in cities - such as these examples from Berlin, Manchester, Paris and Sheffield.

The Firefighting Museum

The old building of the Minsk Philharmonic

House of Government

Minsk, the capital of Belarus, has a rich historical heritage largely influenced by its Jewish population whose history dates back centuries.

In the 15th century, Minsk became the most important commercial centre of Belarus. In 1441, Kazimierz Jagiellończyk, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, granted it trading privileges which meant Jews could lease custom duties.

The centuries that followed brought times of prosperity and growth for the Jews of Minsk because they were granted privileges to acquire real estate and were free to buy land for new cemeteries. Between 1648-1649, they were expelled during the Khmelnitsky Uprising, returning in 1658.

By the 18th century, Minsk became widely recognised as a centre for Jewish education. In 1917, the size of the Jewish community grew to 67,000 people, with 83 houses of prayer in the town.

In the first few months of 1941, there were around 90,000 Jews in Minsk. When the Germans invaded the city in June that year, the number of Jews in Minsk grew to around 100,000. Jewish refugees from Białystok (in Poland) and the territory of 'West Belarus’ moved into the city trying to escape Nazi violence.

With the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Belarus became a bloody battleground. Much of Minsk was destroyed and over 100,000 Jews were killed in the Minsk Ghetto. Jews in Belarus who survived the Holocaust lived under communism and religious oppression.

Today in Belarus, UK CharityThe Together Planis working on a community-centric sustainable development project to build aJewish Cultural heritage route in Belarusas part of theAEPJ European Route of Jewish Heritage, and one of theCultural Routes of the Council of Europe. The project involves working with communities in Belarus to identify and map tangible and intangible Jewish heritage.

Jews once lived across the whole of the territory of modern day Belarus. The goal of the project is to show where that life existed by marking buildings to highlight the contribution the Jewish communities made and, in doing so, helping those that are there today.

Here are a few of the secrets that Minsk has to share - buildings with Jewish provenance that nobody knew about until now.

In the middle of the 19th century, the Volunteer Firefighting Society of Minsk was formed at the address 12, Gorodskoy Val. Right after its creation, the society built a fire station on the other side of its public plaza due to frequent fires and entire streets burning down from minor mishaps.

The majority of the city's population at the time were Jewish and so were most of the firefighters. Therefore, the Jewish community paid for the construction of the fire station which opened on 21 January 1885, with a six-horse stable for the Fire Society next door.

The fire station building has survived intact and unscathed and today is the Museum of Firefighting. It introduces visitors to the local history of firefighting traditions and equipment as well as its firefighting heroes. It also shares rare photographs and archival documents covering the largest fires in the history of Belarus.

Few know of the pre-war building of the Minsk Philharmonic located at the address 17, Karl Marx.

Surprisingly, before the Great Patriotic War, Minsk was the jazz centre of the Soviet Union. Eddie Rosner, the German Jewish jazz performer, trumpeter, arranger, and conductor - one of the greatest musicians of the 20th century - lived and worked in the city. For seven years, he led the first and unfortunately last of Belarus' state jazz orchestras - the finest swing big band of 1940s USSR, by European standards. Rosner was the first jazz instrumentalist in Soviet history to be awarded the honorary title of Honoured Artist of the Republic.

Eddie Rosner's first concert in Minsk was held in October 1939, and within a year, he led the Belarusian Republican Jazz Orchestra. Minsk marvelled, relishing in 'Rosner's jazz'. His orchestra played in liberated Minsk in 1944, as well as for Stalin in Sochi in 1945.

With such uproarious success, rumours spread that Eddie played a trumpet made of solid gold. However, in 1946, jazz was banned in the Soviet Union, and Eddie was forced to leave first for Moscow and then for Germany. His emigration resulted in a ban on his name and on any mention of him. Eddie Rosner never took his rightful place among major cultural figures, and today is known only to a small circle of jazz fans.

Independence Square is one of the loveliest squares in Minsk, connected to the name of the talented Leningrad architect Iosif Langbard. Langbard was from a Jewish family that lived in Bielsk, a quiet town in Grodno Gubernia (region). He had a talent for drawing and after graduating from grammar school, studied architecture.

In 1929, Langbard commenced designs for the development of the centre of Minsk - his Government House won an all-Union competition. It was the largest building in pre-war Minsk, even now it is striking in its grandeur.

Motivated by success, Langbard contemplated the refurbishment of the entire Belarusian capital. His concept envisaged the preservation of pre-revolutionary architectural monuments, but promoted the 'creation of a new city based on Belarusian architectural traditions'. The construction of the Government House took place from 1930 to 1935, influencing not only Independence Square, but Minsk as a whole.

In 1934, Langbard designed the square in front of the Government House (called Lenin Square until 1991). The square was intended to become a social centre, ushering in new architecture. And so it happened: it was redesigned on numerous occasions, evolving with the city.

Until the end of the 1950s, the square featured a public garden and small stone buildings. Between 1963-1964, the old buildings, including those near the Minsk Hotel, were demolished to enlarge the square. Today, Independence Square is a unified complex of commercial, entertainment, and historical-cultural buildings in an integrated layout.

Meet the man who gave his name to tobacco's addictive stimulant

Nicotine is a chemical, which has been widely used as a stimulant for centuries. Found in the nightshade family of plants, most of us will predominantly know nicotine as the drug found in tobacco.

As a stimulant, nicotine speeds up the messages travelling between the brain and body. Nicotine is highly addictive, and has a wide range of adverse health effects on humans.

As it's most commonly found in tobacco, nicotine has been used by people in Europe since the middle of the 16th century when tobacco was introduced to Europe. By the late 17th century, tobacco was being commonly used as a drug, while nicotine was also found in insecticides.

At the time of the arrival of Europeans, tobacco was the most widely used psychoactive plant used in the Americas. Brought to Europe by Christopher Columbus, it was initially considered to be medicinal and was used variously as an aphrodisiac, in treatment of pain, to alleviate intestinal colic and to heal wounds.

The scientific name for the tobacco plant isNicotiana tabacum.

This name derives from a 16th diplomat, Jean Nicot de Villemain (1530-1604), who was the French ambassador in Portugal.

Nicot served in this diplomatic role in Lisbon under three French kings, from 1547 to 1574. (Excerpts from his diplomatic papers can be read on Europeana.) Later in his life, in he compiled one of the first French dictionaries (which was published posthumously in 1606).

In 1560, Nicot is credited as introducing tobacco to the French court. He brought tobacco plants from Portugal, believing they had medicinal value. Snuff tobacco became popular with the nobility in the court, band eventually more and more of Paris's fashionable people began to use the plant, making Nicot a celebrity.

In 1586, the botanist Jaques Dalechamps gave the tobacco plant the scientific nameHerba nicotiana. Later, this was also adopted by Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus, who is considered the 'father of modern species taxonomy'.

As science developed through the 19th century, nicotine was identified as an isolated chemical and drug by German chemistsWilhelm Heinrich Posseltand Karl Ludwig Reimann in 1828. They believed it was a poison.

Its exact chemical formula was described by Belgian scientist Louis-Henri-Frédéric Melsens in 1843. By 1893, German chemists Adolf Pinner and Richard Wolffenstein had discovered its structure.

Today, although nicotine has many harmful effects, it is legal and widely used across Europe and globally, with its name stemming all the way back to the 16th century French diplomat. As for Monsieur Nicot, his moniker now goes beyond nicotine and can be found on streets and other buildings across France.

Industry

Arts and culture

Leisure

What do you do when you really want something and then someone tells you no, you can't have it? Well, if you're the city of Leeds in the UK, and the thing you want is to be European Capital of Culture, but you had to cancel this when the UK left the European Union, then what you do is... you go ahead with your plans anyway!

In 2023, Leeds is celebrating its firstYear of Culture, starting with an event called 'The Awakening', which is followed by a year-long programme of events including virtual tours, so you can join in from anywhere in the world.

The organisers say: 'The city of Leeds is bursting with culture. And it can change lives. But not everyone feels they have the freedom to access culture and creativity. Through our spirit, we'll all change that, together.'

The year also includes '1001 Stories' - a mass-participation project that will put the voices, histories and stories of older people centre-stage by gathering 1001 stories from those aged 60 and over and creating new artistic work based on these stories.

Leeds is the largest city in West Yorkshire, and competes with Manchester to potentially be the UK's third largest city (the second is either Manchester or Birmingham depending on how you measure it).

So, what is Leeds famous for and what can the world thank the city for?

Located at the heart of the industrial revolution, Leeds has long been known for its textile and manufacturing industries. By the 14th century, Leeds was already an important centre of wool trade. The industrial revolution brought major changes, and the city's textile and manufacturing industries flourished. Many mills and factories produced wool, clothing and other goods.

By the late 18th century, the city was home to the largest wool market in the world, Armley Mills, which has now been transformed into Leeds Industrial Museum.

In fact, Leeds' industry inspired art: Joseph Mallord William Turner painted the earliest known depiction of a British industrial landscape looking at Leeds.

Once dark and blackened by the grime and soot of its industrial success, Leeds has reinvented itself to become a thriving centre for arts and culture.

It boasts the longest running West Indian carnival in Europe and the Guinness World Record for the longest running music hall at the City Varieties. It is home to arts organisations such as Northern Ballet, Opera North and a music conservatoire and hosts a range of arts events, like Leeds Light Night - the UK's largest annual arts and light festival, which sees the city's indoor and outdoor spaces transformed by everything from large-scale light projections and interactive installations, to music, dance and street performances.

One thing Leeds is particularly renowned for in the arts world is sculpture, which has played an important role in the city's arts scene.

Celebrated sculptor Henry Moore was born in Yorkshire, in Castleford to the southeast of Leeds. From 1919 to 1921, he studied at the Leeds School of Art, which set up a sculpture studio, especially for him.

One of the most influential British artists of the 20th century and a pioneer of post-war modernism, Moore's sculptures can now be found in museums and public spaces across Europe and beyond.

In Leeds, theHenry Moore Institutenow shows exhibitions as well as holding an extensive research library on Moore and sculpture in general.

Several of Moore's sculptures can also be seen at theYorkshire Sculpture Parknear Wakefield, around 30 kilometres southeast of Leeds. Founded in 1977, this is the first sculpture park in the UK and the largest in Europe.

Alongside Moore's sculptures, Yorkshire Sculpture Park displays sculpture by Barbara Hepworth. She was born in Wakefield in 1903 and also studied at Leeds School of Art. She was a leading modernist sculptor whose abstract artworks were inspired by the natural world.

As for literature, it is thought that JRR Tolkien came up with the idea forThe Hobbitwhilst studying at Leeds University. Another Leeds University alumni, Nigerian writer Wole Soyinka, went on to win the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1986.

The city has also been home to leading playwright, screenwriter and actor Alan Bennett (The Madness of George III/The History Boys), and Helen Fielding who wroteBridget Jones' Diary, while Joanne Harris who wroteChocolatwas a teacher at Leeds Grammar School.

Leeds has one of the largest recreational parks in Europe - Roundhay Park - with 700 acres (2.8 square kilometres) of parkland, lakes, woodland and gardens. It was created by William the Conqueror, and even has a song written about it.

And it was in a garden near Roundhay in 1888 that the first motion pictures were shot, by a Frenchman named Louis Le Prince.

Not long after this, thefather of cinematography disappearedand no-one seems to know what happened to him. That might be why he doesn't get much credit - his working motion picture model preceded those by Thomas Edison and the Lumière brothers by some years, but his disappearance meant he wasn't around to promote his own.

So if you ever go to the cinema you have Leeds to thank for it. But that's not all. That soda you buy to slurp on throughout the film - thank Leeds for that too.

This was one of those happy accident type inventions. Joseph Priestley - chemist and inventor among many other things - discovered a way to infuse water with carbon dioxide when he suspended a bowl of water over a beer vat in a brewery in Leeds in 1767. He then wrote about the 'peculiar satisfaction' he felt when drinking it. And it was this invention that led to the creation of the soft drinks industry.

But if you’re staying in, then say thanks to Leeds again, because many of those board games that bring you and your family so much joy (and frustration!) may have their origins in a company called Waddingtons. John Waddington set up the company in Leeds initially as a printing firm then branched out into games in 1922.

Railways changed how we transported goods and people, and Leeds has the oldest continuously working railway in the world, founded in 1758. It was also the first commercial railway to use steam locomotives successfully. It's still running today as a heritage railway along its 1.6 kilometre track.

Over a century of Croatian fashion history

Rising in popularity throughout the 19th Century and falling from grace in the 20th, the history of hats in Europe is a turbulent and fascinating one. Hatmaking and hat-wearing went largely in and out of fashion over the span of a little over a century.

One city that many see as sitting on the periphery of Europe was actually one of the most important centres of headgear fashion over the past 200 years. This is the story of how Zagreb became one of the hat capitals of Europe.

Zagreb, a city on the edge of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, wasn't far behind the imperial capital Vienna in terms of fashion around the end of the 19th Century.

The magazineParižka moda, the only fashion magazine in the Croatian language at the time, played a major role in the transmission of fashion information. Austrian fashion magazines were also available, of whichWiener Mode was the most popular.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, Zagreb profiled itself as a fashion centre, with numerous fashion salons setting up shop in the city. Josip Pesta, Gjuro Matić and Ivan Božićević were some of the famous names in fashion that settled in the city.

Female dressmakers and milliners were often adept at designing hats according to the latest Parisian fashion. One of them was Dragica Šmid, whose salon was located in the centre of Zagreb.

In Dragica's salon, she offered a large selection of hats for ladies, girls and children. Like all other fashionistas, she made hats from felt, straw, fur and fabric. The salon also offered ready-made mourning hats - from the simplest to the finest models.

Her clients were women from prominent and well-to-do Zagreb families, such as Jelka Winkler, the wife of the Zagreb doctor Eugen Winkler. Dragica Šmid ran the salon until 1928; then her daughter took over. The salon existed until 1945.

With the establishment of Yugoslavia after World War I, Zagreb became the main commercial and banking centre of the country. Fashion trends still came from Vienna and Paris via fashion and women's magazines, such asŽenski list,SvijetandHrvatica. Local milliner salons were able to copy and adapt to European fashion novelties through a high level of craftsmanship, style and creativity.

Starting in the 1930s, Zagreb's downtown would become the centre of multiple craft fairs, where one could also find milliners exhibiting their products.

After World War II, Zagreb became the capital of the Federal Republic of Croatia, one of the six federal republics in the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia.

Under the new regime, artisans were seen as remnants of capitalist society and were expected to put their labour and goods to the service of the state. They were forced to join various cooperatives, like the Hat and Cap Makers Cooperative.

The first post-war women's magazineModni list, later renamedNaša moda, and the magazineSvijet, relaunched in 1953, brought Parisian fashion news straight from French magazines such asVogue,L'OfficielandModes & Travauxinto the Yugoslavian world. Artisan fashion shows continued to exist, becoming the gathering place of the new socialist elite led by politicians' wives.

The hat, as a symbol of urban elegance, was the most desirable fashion accessory of the new privileged social class, which had a favourable effect on the re-blooming of the milliner craft.

The 1960s in Croatia were marked by a wave of liberalisation of the regime, which was most evident in opening up free travel abroad. This led to the popularisation of one-day shopping trips to Graz in Austria and Trieste in Italy. Western European products were very desirable, partly as symbols of freedom, fashion awareness and belonging to the Western European fashion and cultural circle.

After the 1960s, the hat lost its leading role as the most important fashion accessory. Despite this trend, the interest in hats has not stopped in Zagreb, as evidenced by the successful business of the Kobali Hat Salon, as well as the work of milliner and hat artist Staša Čimbur.

This blog was written as part of theCRAFTED project, which aimed to enrich and promote traditional and contemporary crafts.

Enslavement, theology and a literary legacy

In 1742, a missionary called Jacobus Capitein gave a lecture at the University of Leiden arguing that Christianity makes people free - spiritually - and so was not incompatible with enslavement. His lecture, originally in Latin, was translated into Dutch and was so popular it was reprinted five times in its first year. He provided biblical and theological justification for the West India Company’s ongoing involvement in enslavement.

What’s unusual about this is the fact that Capitein himself was African and Black. In fact, he had been enslaved himself.

Taken from his family in present-day Ghana at the age of around eight, Capitein was first sold to a Dutch captain and then given as a present to Jacobus van Goch, of the Dutch West India Company, who brought him to live in The Hague, the Netherlands. Van Goch sent him to school and allowed him to follow his own interests and thus Capitein felt that he was treated well. Capitein describes van Goch as ‘someone who will have my filial affection right up to the grave’. Capitein, whose original name is unknown, studied theology and became a minister.

Whilst Capitein’s justification of enslavement is pretty uncomfortable, remember that at the time - in the mid-1700s - rejection of enslavement was difficult. Capitein’s goal was to have more Africans baptised, and his philosophy - that enslavement and Christianity were not incompatible - could help with that.

There was opposition to slavery as early as 1600s and the very first anti-enslavement petition was created by Dutch-speaking Quakers in 1688s in North America. This extended to the Quakers network in Great Britain banning all Quakers from participating in enslavement. Hendrik L Bosman mentions that despite several voices arguing for the abolishment of enslavement, Capitein argued in favour that baptism still allowed enslaved people to remain enslaved, supporting slave traders to allow conversion.

His argument countered that of Godefridus Corneliszoon Udemans (1581–1649), a Dutch minister who had argued that enslaved people should be freed seven years after they were baptised. This would have discouraged enslavers to allow enslaved people to be baptised in the first place. Following Capitein’s philosophy, people could be both baptised and continue to be enslaved.

Hendrik L Bosman notes that Capitein was strongly influenced by his adopted country and family and was filled with gratitude for his freedom and education. But organisations that benefitted from enslavement, such as the West Indian Trading Company, also used Capitein as an example to justify enslavement.

Jacobus Capitein was one of the first sub-Saharan Africans to study at a European university. Studies complete, he became the first Black minister of the Reformed Church and then returned to Elmina (in present-day Ghana) to work as a chaplain and missionary, as a well-paid employee of the West Indian Trading Company.

Whether or not he really wanted to do so is unclear, as he says, ‘I admit that I do not clearly remember whether I disclosed to anyone that such an idea appealed to me.’ But he took on the challenge nonetheless. He was not liked by the white enslavers - because he was Black - and nor was he trusted by the Africans - because he was too Dutch. So his mission to baptise the local people did not go very well.

Despite this, it is clear from his letters that he tried to understand and bring together the multiple cultures that existed in Elmina. He cared about the local community and wanted to understand the perspectives of others but seemed to be hampered at every turn by unsupportive authorities.

Capitein did have some successes. He revived a local school and in one of his first letters, we hear how he expresses his delight about his new intake of students: ‘As concerns the zeal, natural intelligence, and progress of this small group of schoolchildren, to this point we are astonished and thoroughly satisfied.’

And he has another legacy too. Capitein’s translations of the Lord’s Prayer and Ten Commandments and other biblical texts into Mfantse - a language spoken around the Gold Coast at the time - were some of the first examples of the written word in Ghana.

Not long after arriving in Elmira, Capitein wrote to his church (the Classis in the Netherlands) that he wished to marry ‘a young negress’ who has ‘shown herself to be fitter for and better capable of education than most’. This match would help Capitein integrate into the local community. It seemed he genuinely liked her. Her parents gave permission, but the Church did not. He was not to marry ‘a heathen’. And so in May 1746, Capitein married a ‘young European Christian girl’  who it seems had been sent to Elmira by the church authorities.

Capitein died just five years after returning to Elmira, in 1747 aged around 30. He had failed in his mission to convert the local population to Christianity, and made himself unpopular with both the African and European populations there. He had also run up debts of almost 9,000 guilders, which, for comparison, was almost 20 times the annual salary of a master carpenter at the time.

In 1745, Capitein wrote to the West Indian Trading Company (his employer) of his wish to leave. It took them two years to reply and, when they did, he was denied and then told off for errors in his biblical translations. Capitein, by this time, was no longer interested in this kind of discussion and was instead more concerned about supporting his community, and feeling thoroughly let down.

Did Capitein’s time in Africa change his perception of enslavement? It seems so. He is reported to have said in a sermon that had he not been as lucky, he would have ‘wasted my tender years and age in bodily slavery’. Academic Christine Levecqends her paperon Capitein with the observation that, ‘All the signs before his death indicate that he wished the same kind of luck to all the young Africans growing up around him.’

An Art Nouveau home by Charles Rennie Mackintosh and Margaret Macdonald

In 1901, in Glasgow, Scotland, the well-known architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh entered a competition to designHouse for an Art Lover, arranged by the German design magazineZeitschrift Für Innendekoration.

At the time, Mackintosh was 33 years old, and had been married for a year to the artist and designer Margaret Macdonald, 38. They took on the competition together, just as they would with many new projects.

Catherine Cranston's tea room, in the centre of Glasgow, which they designed and furnished together, is a good example of Margaret and Charles' cooperation.

Miss Cranston gave them freedom to create a unique avant-garde interior design for The Willow Tea Rooms, including furniture (the highback chair - one of Mackintosh's signatures - is to be found here), light fittings, wall decorations and even the cutlery and the menu card, with text beautifully designed by Margaret. Work like this is called 'total design' and made Miss Cranston's tea room famous all over the world.

There were 36 entries in the open competition. The architects were given 25 days to design a distinctly modern house, where art should be part of the house itself, instead of in a separate art gallery attached to the building.

When we think of their 'total design' of Miss Cranston's tea room, this must have been a perfect starting point for Mackintosh and Macdonald. There was also another unusual clause in the rules, which also would have suited them perfectly well: 'It is permissible and even desirable that an architect and a decorative artist of modern tastes develop and submit the design jointly'. Check!

Within some practical constraints like room sizes and a maximum cost, Charles and Margaret were free to use their skills, inventiveness and fantasy to design the house. Not an ordinary house, but aHouse for an Art Lover.

25 days later Charles and Margaret submitted their entry, calling it 'the Bird' Why? Either for a special (to me unknown) reason, or just because the entries had to have a title. Unfortunately, they failed to send three perspectives of the interior, and thus were disqualified.

The judges were disappointed in the remaining entries, and the first prize was not won. The English architect M. H. Baillie Scott was awarded second prize. However, Mackintosh and Macdonald completed their entry, which impressed the judges. Thus, their drawings were later published as a set of 14 lithographed plates. But the actual construction ofHouse for an Art Loverwas not on the horizon.

From the outside, the house is - overwhelming in size and construction (at least to me). Charles and Margaret concentrated on the interior. Juxtapositions are found all over the house, like light and dark, natural and abstract, feminine and masculine, simplicity and complexity and so on. House for an Art Lover was designed to be seen and experienced as a whole, and is an outstanding example of the Modern Style, British Art Nouveau.

So, didHouse for an Art Loveronly exist on paper? Mackintosh and Macdonald had other things to do. They continued to live and work together, as well as working on projects separately, for the rest of their lives. Charles Mackintosh died of cancer in 1928, Margaret passed away five years later in 1933.

But that's not the end ofHouse for an Art Lover's story which continued until 1989, more than 80 years later! Then Graham Roxburgh, an engineer in charge of restoring another Mackintosh design, has the idea to actually buildHouse for an Art Lover.

Roxburgh and a team of architects, led by Professor Andy MacMillan, had to do a lot of detective work before the building could start. The team found, for instance, that the original drawings were very detailed as a competition entry, but were still not intended to be technical instructions from which a house could be built.

Residential homes completed by Mackintosh and Macdonald over the years became important in providing clues to the building process.

In 1996,House for an Art Loveropened to the public, situated in Bellahouston Park in central Glasgow. The House invites visitors to see rooms furnished and decorated from the original drawings, realised by contemporary artists and craftspeople alongside changing art exhibitions. Charles and Margaret never saw their designs realised, but I really wish that they had!

Paving stones across Europe to commemorate victims of persecution

Stolperstein are small, brass memorials placed in the pavements of cities across Europe to commemorate victims of Nazi persecution. Created by artist Gunter Demnig since 1992, these small stones serve as a reminder of the atrocities committed during the Holocaust and the countless lives that were lost.

The Stolperstein project aims to honour the individual victims of Nazi persecution by placing a small brass stone, inscribed with the name and life details of a victim, in front of the victim's last known residence. The stones measure just 10 by 10 centimeters. The nameStolpersteintranslates to 'stumbling stones' - they are intended to be stumbled upon, serving as a reminder of the suffering and loss.

Each Stolperstein is individually funded and can be sponsored by private individuals, schools or and organisations. The project has gained widespread support, with more than 75,000 Stolperstein placed in over 1,600 cities across Europe.

In addition to honoring the victims of Nazi persecution, the Stolperstein project also serves as a way to educate the public about the horrors of the Holocaust. Many of the victims commemorated by the stones were ordinary people. The majority of Stolpersteine commemorate Jewish victims of the Holocaust. Others have been placed for Romani people, LGBTQ+ people, people with disabilities, Black people, and people who were  who were persecuted for their religious, political and social beliefs.

The first Stolperstein was placed on 16 December 1992, a date which marked 50 years since an order was signed to begin the mass deportation of Jewish people and Roma from Germany.

Gunter Demnig commemorated this by pulling a machine which printed the words Eine Spur durchs Vergessen (A trace against forgetting) through Cologne to its train station. Afterward, he installed the first Stolperstein in front of Cologne City Hall. Gradually, the project expanded to individual memorials for victims of Nazi persecution, always doing so at the last places of residence which they were free to choose.

Stolperstein symbolically bring victims back to their former homes and neighbourhoods.

Some criticisms have arose about stolperstein as they are placed in pavements, where people can step on or over them. Others point to the fact that the victims may not wish to be memorialised in this way. However, for most, stolperstein serve as reminders of the Holocaust and its victims, honouring them with individual memorials in the places where they rightfully belonged.

A fusion of landscapes

Paula Rego

Five illustrated moments from Jane Eyre

Artworks inspired by stories and literature, girlhood and feminism

One of the joys of reading a book is seeing what pictures your imagination will paint. And, of course, yours will be different to mine.

Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Brontë, is one of the earliest novels written from a child's perspective, and was originally published under the name Currer Bell. It is a story that conjures up both the bright and the dark.

When I first read it in my late twenties, Jane was a revelation to me. She's intelligent, witty, full of grit and with a determination to live her life regardless of both the challenges thrown at her personally and the restrictions placed on women in 19th century England generally. She would not suffer fools gladly and I loved her for it. She's a feminist icon, an anti-heroine even.

Writer Charlotte Brontë grew up in a small village called Haworth in West Yorkshire in the UK. It's a beautiful little place, full of contrasts.

You'll find cafe culture, festivals and plenty of bunting, as well as Yorkshire stone blackened by the smoke of the industrial revolution and often dark foreboding skies.Jane Eyreopens with the latter - 'There was no possibility of taking a walk that day… the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so penetrating, that further outdoor exercise was now out of the question.'

With its steep cobbled and narrow streets neighbouring vast moorland spaces, Brontë’s setting is at the same time claustrophobic and confining yet overwhelmingly open.

You can visit the family home at the Brontë Parsonage Museum - 'a historic, intimate space' - and then walk up onto the moor and smell the heather and watch the weather move in. You can experience both the openness and opportunity and the confinement and bleakness that made their way into Charlotte's works and those of her sisters, Emily and Anne.

This landscape infuses Charlotte Brontë's work and as a reader, we build a whole world of sights, sounds and smells, from her words. So it's fascinating when we get a glimpse into someone else's imaginary world and can look at how their interpretation is different to our own. Here’s a great example.

Paula Rego was a Portuguese-British artist who produced artworks inspired by fairytale, storybooks and literature, often reflecting girlhood and feminism and her Portuguese heritage.

One set of lithographs, produced in 2002 and published in book form in 2004, gives usJane Eyrefrom Paula's perspective.

'It all comes out of my head,'says Rego. 'All little girls improvise, and it's not just illustration: I make it my own.' And Rego's ownJane Eyreis a dark place. The world she conjures up is infused not just by Brontë's words but by Rego's own experiences.

'Rego has explored, in a myriad different sequences of pictures, the conditions of her own upbringing in Portugal, her formation as a girl and a woman, and the oscillation between stifling social expectations and liberating female stratagems,' says historian, writer and expert in feminism and fairytaleMarina Warner. 'Rego reproduces the psychological drama in the book through distortions of scale, cruel expressiveness of gesture, and disturbingly stark contrasts of light and welling shadows.'

Rego's images were used by the UK's Royal Mail forstampscommemorating the 150th anniversary of the death of Charlotte Brontë in February 2005. At this time, the words like 'unorthodox' and 'anti-illustrations' started to be used about them (seeCreative (mis)reading? Paula Rego’s Jane Eyreby Laurent Bury).

Had Rego somehow 'mis-read' the book? You decide...

Let's look at some of Paula Rego's artworks and the passages they illustrate. We've taken the text fromJane EyreviaProject Gutenberg.

In the first chapter, an orphaned ten-year-old Jane Eyre hides herself away from her cruel aunt and bullying cousins.

A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there. It contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care that it should be one stored with pictures. I mounted into the window-seat: gathering up my feet…

To remove her from her aunt’s home, Jane is sent away to Lowood School, run by the formidable and abusive Mr Brocklehurst. Here, Jane makes a friend in Helen Burns. One day, Burns is in trouble for not having cleaned her nails.

Burns immediately left the class, and [...] returned in half a minute, carrying in her hand a bundle of twigs tied together at one end. This ominous tool she presented to Miss Scatcherd with a respectful curtsey; then she quietly, and without being told, unloosed her pinafore, and the teacher instantly and sharply inflicted on her neck a dozen strokes with the bunch of twigs. Not a tear rose to Burns' eye...

At Lowood School, Mr Brocklehurst warns the other students against Jane, to whom he has taken a strong dislike.

"Fetch that stool," said Mr. Brocklehurst, pointing to a very high one from which a monitor had just risen: it was brought.

"Place the child upon it.'
…
"My dear children," pursued the black marble clergyman [...] You must be on your guard against her; you must shun her example; if necessary, avoid her company, exclude her from your sports, and shut her out from your converse."

After eight years at Lowood (six as a student and two as a teacher), Jane takes up a role of governess at Thornfield Hall. One winter's day, she is out for a walk and helps a man whose horse has slipped on the ice. Later, she discovers this is Mr Rochester, owner of Thornfield Hall.

I could see him plainly. His figure was enveloped in a riding cloak, fur collared and steel clasped; its details were not apparent, but I traced the general points of middle height and considerable breadth of chest. He had a dark face, with stern features and a heavy brow; his eyes and gathered eyebrows looked ireful and thwarted just now; he was past youth, but had not reached middle-age; perhaps he might be thirty-five. I felt no fear of him, and but little shyness.

Jane and the rest of the household staff prepare the house for Mr Rochester's return to Thornfield after a period of time away. He brings with him a party of ladies, gentlemen, maids and valets.

A joyous stir was now audible in the hall: gentlemen's deep tones and ladies' silvery accents blent harmoniously together…
…
Presently the chambers gave up their fair tenants one after another: each came out gaily and airily, with dress that gleamed lustrous through the dusk. For a moment they stood grouped together at the other extremity of the gallery, conversing in a key of sweet subdued vivacity: they then descended the staircase almost as noiselessly as a bright mist rolls down a hill. Their collective appearance had left on me an impression of high-born elegance, such as I had never before received.

What do you think? Do Paula Rego's illustrations match your own imaginings? Is her world ofJane Eyredarker than you thought?

Navigating between contemporary creation, traditional know-how and conservation

The Mobilier National is a French public establishment with the objective of supporting and promoting art and creative crafts. It does so by overseeing the creation and conservation of tens of thousands of pieces of furniture and objects intended to supply French public buildings, including those abroad. The Mobilier National ensures the conservation and restoration of its French national collections, thanks to its workshops. It perpetuates and transmits know-how by training craftsmen, as well as promoting contemporary creation and French decorative arts. The pieces of furniture designed by Mobilier National are not museum pieces, but pieces of furniture for use.

The Mobilier National is rooted in the French royal Garde-Meuble. This was a special administration started by Henri IV (1553-1610) and developed by Louis XIV (1638-1715) and his minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert, who stands at the origin of the Manufacture des Meubles de la Couronne (Manufacture of the Furniture of the Crown). It temporarily became the Mobilier Impérial and took the name of Mobilier National with the establishment of the Third Republic in 1870.

The Mobilier National is now attached to the French Ministry of Culture and has added new workshops. The arts and crafts are distributed among various workshops, which have developed over time in Paris and the French regions. Today, more than 340 employees work for Mobilier National: the Gobelins tapestry workshop, the Beauvais tapestry workshop, the Savonnerie carpet workshop, the lace workshop of Puy-en-Velay, the workshop of research and development, and seven restoration workshops.

The Gobelinshaute-lice(high-heddle) tapestry manufacture was founded under the reign of Henri IV and transformed by Colbert in the 1660's. A few years later, Colbert founded the Beauvaisbasse-lice(low-heddle) tapestry manufacture in the eponymous town. TheSavonneriecarpet manufacture is located in Paris, in an old soap factory from which it takes its name, and was created under Louis XIII. In the 1930s the three historic textile manufacturersLes Gobelins,La SavonnerieandBeauvaiswere united within the Mobilier National.

Discovering the Mobilier National: The Manufacture des Gobelins

These workshops are associated with a dyeing workshop, also located in the Enclos des Gobelins in Paris, which is in charge of treating and preparing the wool.

Discovering the Mobilier National: the dyeing workshop

The lace workshop of Puy-en-Velay in Alençon preserves the tradition and manual techniques of lace. The lace-making activity developed in Alençon thanks to Colbert, but it was threatened with disappearing in the middle of the twentieth century due to the rise of machine-created lace. In 1976, the Mobilier National created two state-funded workshops whose work has been included on UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity since 2010.

Since the 17th century, Mobilier National has supported contemporary art and craft creation. The Research and Creation Workshop (ARC), is in charge of contemporary design and manufacture. Created at the initiative of André Malraux (former minister of Cultural Affairs), it allows talented designers to emerge, enabling them to produce ambitious pieces and to supply French national institutions.



Mobilier National also relies on seven restoration workshops divided by different specialities of wood, metal and textile. They allow the conservation of the ancient collections of the Mobilier National.

Training is at the heart of Mobilier National's activity and responds to the need to transmit know-how. In 2020, the Mobilier National launched theCampus d'Excellencedes métiers d'arts et du design - Paris Manufacture des Gobelins, Composed of several establishments, the Campus brings together excellent training in the fields of design and arts and crafts. It brings together courses, institutions, companies, foundations and sponsors.

Artistic moo-vements

Artists have been painting and drawing cows for centuries. The ways in which cows have been depicted over time reflects various artist movements and influences.

Artists who both worked in studios and, from the 19th century onwards,en plein airhave chosen cows as their subject matter, perhaps reflecting the important relationship between humans and cows as well as a way of highlighting and focusing on rural lifestyles.

Let's take a look at several significant artworks featuring cows.

This painting of an Ayrshire cow by William Shiels was painted primarily for scientific purposes. It was one of 100 animal portraits which were part of a process of description and classification that was essential to the successful breeding of improved livestock.

The paintings were commissioned in the 1830s by Professor David Low, the University of Edinburgh's first-ever chair of agriculture. William Shiels, a portrait and animal painter, was sent all over Britain to paint cattle, horses, sheep, goats, pigs and dogs - spending 8 years on the road doing so.

This portrait of a bull was painted in 1647 by Paulus Potter, who was just 22 years old at the time. It is a vast painting, measuring more than three metres in width and two metres in height.

It is a significant artwork from the 17th century in the Netherlands, made noteworthy by its realism and rustic setting. Bulls were a sign of prosperity and wealth, though had not been painted previously. Although the realistic details in the painting suggest one animal, livestock experts determine that the depiction of the bull's anatomy imply it is a composite of several different animals.

This small oil painting measures just 16 by 20 centimetres. It was painted between 1840 and 1860 by Austrian artist Friedrich Gauermann. He was known for landscape paintings as well as animal portraits.

Though he attended the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna in his late teenage years, Gauermann was mostly a self-taught artist. In his early years, Gauermann learned by copying animal paintings by Jacob van Ruisdael and Paulus Potter among others.

Many of his paintings depict animals outdoors in their natural environments but, in this painting, the cow is confined within a barn and its head is obscured.

Swedish artist Oscar Björck painted this painting in 1890 after a trip to the Skagen, a town in the north of Denmark.

Björck was one of several Scandinavian artists who travelled to Skagen in the 19th century, inspired by the village's scenery, landscape and fishing community - all of which were captured by their many paintings. Björck's painting is a depiction of the daily toil of farmers working with cows, all of whom in the painting are women. He has devoted great attention to the rendering of light and shadow in the room.

This paintingThe New Settlersby Antanas Gudaiti was painted in 1933. In this expressive painting, there are vibrant colour combinations - the goat is blue and the cow is bright red.

Antanas Gudaitis is one of the most eminent Lithuanian painters of the 20th century. This painting was produced in the second half of 1933, after he had returned to Lithuania having studied for four years in Paris. The colours here reflect the tastes for modern painting in Paris at the time.

Cow in the ford at duskis a watercolour by Austrian artist Friedrich König.

He was involved with the Hagen Society, an Art Nouveau group including several artists who later founded the Vienna Secession. This watercolour comes from the Society's inventory, and depicts a cow from behind in a body of water amid an expressive purple and pink sunset.

Dutch landscape painter Willem Maris painted this cow between 1885 and 1895.

Willem Maris mainly painted natural landscapes with animals. His artworks are considered to be part of The Hague School, a group of artists who lived and worked in The Hague between 1860 and 1890.

The painters of the Hague school painted in a realist manner using relatively sombre colours. Maris's lively use of colour distinguished him, and thus he was often called the 'Impressionist of the Hague School'.

Danish artist Theodor Philipsen painted this dynamic painting of cattle on the island of Saltholm between 1888 and 1892. Unlike other paintings here, these cattle are running away from the viewer. The short, richly coloured brushstrokes make the picture vibrate with light, colour, and atmosphere.

Philipsen is known as an artist who adapted the styles and techniques of French Impressionist painting to a style more influenced by the Danish countryside and climate. The colour palette used in this painting, as well as the way the shadows reflects from the cattle, shows his priority is more on portraying sunlight and the power of nature.

Four videos showing how Greek identities are embodied by the craft of weaving, weaving together past, present and future

When thinking about Greece and its history, it is impossible not to mention mythology: stories and tales encapsulating the behaviours, values and beliefs of a country and, above all, of its people. Traditional crafts are included in these myths, most times they are the core of the narrative, and come to define the character of the different regions of the country, representing migrations, contacts, exchanges and natures.

Weaving represents an important activity for Greece, it is present in its past and also in its present, and we are sure will play a big role in the future of the country. We can go on saying that weaving holds together these three moments in time, allowing the country to maintain traditions and connections to its history while still teaching values to the younger generations through hands, minds and hearts.

In July 2022 EFHA decided to explore the Peloponnese in search for woven stories that could show the complexity of European crafts and recover some testimonies about specific local and global aspects of greek weaving. Thanks to the invaluable support of Angeliki Rumelioti of the Basil Papantoniou Foundation, we discovered a world of colours, materials, techniques and even secrets: a language made of artefacts, spoken by people with many accents, but always with a common understanding and appreciation of the nuances.

The first person we encountered was Ioanna Papantoniou, founder and president of the Basil Papantoniou Foundation in Nafplio, who retraced her life story as if every moment was instrumental in finally being able to establish an institution devoted to the preservation and celebration of Greek customs, and especially to collect objects and memories related to greek costumes and fashion. She then unveiled the story of the Plafi, a carpet made by the women of a village for the wedding of one of them. The Plafi stands as the material testimony of the complex movements and cultural influences that form Greek identity today.

Craft as Collective Memory. Preserving looms, narrating traditions.

We then moved to Leonidio to meet visual artist Loukia Richards and, standing barefoot on a beautiful hand-woven kilim, a carpet that has belonged to her family for generations, learned from her how Craft can be rightfully considered an act of feminine entrepreneurship and even Political Art: a way for society to grow together, and form intangible ties crossing space and time.

Craft as Political Art. Public and personal histories woven in a kilim.

But craft is not just something to be looked at in houses or museums. It is alive, and only in this liveliness can we hope to grasp its true societal and cultural value. Indeed, learning and teaching are actions intrinsically connected with the preservation of craft, as demonstrated by institutions such as SEN Heritage Looms, based in Athens. Here, historian Sophia Tsourinaki starts from the archeological recovery of looms, tools and techniques to teach to a community of weavers, eager to keep writing myths through the production of beautiful objects that retain the flair of tradition.

Craft as Mythopoeia. Teaching the archaeology of weaving in Greece.

What makes craft important are not the objects, though. It is people who are able to turn an action into a feeling, a tradition, and ultimately an embodiment of the identity of an individual and of a community. Many are the voices that can tell this story, from the memories of the women of Tsitalia, to the experience of contemporary weavers who decided to turn traditions into their life work, as Maria Gonidou and Thomai Rodopoulou-Psarologou.

Craft as Community. Woven memories from the Peloponnese.

The result of our journey was a series of videos substantiating: a collection of myths in their own right, demonstrating how narratives and objects together paint the picture of a nation whose strong roots steeped in craft motivate a bright and creative future.

This blog was written as part of theCRAFTED project, which aimed to enrich and promote traditional and contemporary crafts.

Elefsina

Timișoara

Veszprém

Exploring Elefsina, Timișoara and Veszprém

The three European Capitals of Culture for 2023 are Elefsina in Greece, Timișoara in Romania and Veszprém in Hungary. The European Capital of Culture highlights the cultural heritage and history of different European city annually.

Let's make a virtual visit to each city and explore their cultural heritage.

Elefsina, also known as Eleusis, is a town in the historic Greek region Attica, to the northwest of Athens.

As with many cities in Greece, Elefsina has a rich archaeogological history stretching back many centuries covering both Ancient Greece and Roman times. In the 19th and 20th centuries, it develpoped into an industrial city - as exemplified by this photograph.

In Ancient Greece, Eleusis was the site of the Eleusinian Mysteries, one of the most famous secret religious rites of ancient Greece. These were initiations held every year for the cult of Demeter and Persephone.

Elefsina is the birthplace of ancient Greek playwright Aeschylus, who is often described as the father of Greek tragedy.

Aeschylus lived between the 6th and 5th centuries BCE. He is estimated to have written between 70 and 90 plays but only seven have surviving to today.

He entered - and won - many dramatic competitions, which took place as Greek theatre was beginning to evolve. He developed the genre of Greek tragedy. Aeschylus added more characters, scene decoration and made costumes more dramatic. His plays, written in verse, are stories about the gods or are set far away from Greeece, and are moral and religious.

Elefsina honours Aeschylus each year with the Aeschylia Festival. Founded in 1975, it is held at Palaio Elaiourgeio, an open-air theatre on the seafront which was formerly a soap factory.

The festival - held at the end of the summer - includes theatre performances, concerts, dance events and art exhibitions.

Timișoara, located in western Romania, is the country's third city and the second city in Romania to be awarded the European Capital of Culture.

The city has a rich history dating back to the early Middle Ages, and has long been a centre of culture and commerce in the region. It is considered the informal capital of the broader historical region Banat, which was one of the eastern frontiers of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and is now shared by Romania, Serbia and Hungary.

Successive periods of history and rulers - the Ottoman Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, World War I - have all left reminders on Timișoara. The city's varied archicutre is the largest architectural ensemble of historic buildings in Romania, with Baroque, Historicism, Neoclassicism, Art Nouveau and Wiener Secession styles all to be seen in the city.

Timișoara has more than thirty parks and green spaces, which has led it to being given the nickname 'City of Flowers'.

Timișoara was the first city on mainland Europe to have electric street lighting, which was installed in 1884. In 1989, the Revolution against Ceaușescu’s regime began on the streets of Timișoara.

Veszprém is one of the oldest urban areas in Hungary, and is located to the north of Lake Balaton. The European Capital of Culture title in 2023 is held by Veszprém and shared across the the Bakony-Balaton region, with more than 100 towns and villages cooperating to develop projects.

Veszprém is known as the 'City of Queens' as it was there that the Bishop of Veszprém crowned queens of Hungary. It was the first city in Hungary to have a bishop, when the diocese of Veszprém was established - this was believed to have been decreed in 1009 AD by King Stephen I of Hungary. The city was also the favourite of Stephen's wife Queen Gisela.

In the wider region, Lake Balaton is the largest lake in Central Europe, and one of the region's foremost tourist destinations. It is known for its shore towns which developed as resorts, for wine production and water sports.

From east to west

Berlin and Germany

Free movement

How contemporary composers moved within Europe in the 20th century

Why leave? To earn more money, get a better job, achieve self-fulfilment or enjoy artistic freedom – these are just some of the reasons why thousands of artists crossed borders in the 20th century.

It may seem that this was easier for composers, whose reception was not limited by a particular national language. But was it really the case?

There were several waves of composers' migration from, to and within Europe. Most of the relocations were forced or connected with political events. In the 1930s, dozens of renowned composers left for the Americas because of Hitler's rise to power and growing anti-Semitism. There was a similar movement in the 1950s – this time from the Eastern side of the Iron Curtain to the Western side – caused by Stalin's repressive rule.

György Ligeti (1923-2006) travelled one hundred kilometres, from Budapest to Vienna. Born in Transylvania (part of Romania since the end of World War II), half of his family were lost in the Holocaust and later tried to find his way as a composer under the pressure of communist authorities. The Hungarian Revolution of 1956, brutally put down by Soviet troops, left no doubt about the future direction of the country – Ligeti decided to leave, just like many of his countrymen.

In one interview, he recalled that during his escape he had to hide in a mail train under bags full of letters. Soon after, he became anenfant terribleof the European avant-garde. In his senior years, however, he focused on vocal polyphonic works with references to Hungarian folklore.

In turn, pianist and composer Szábolcs Esztényi witnessed terror on Budapest streets when he was only a teenager and later failed the entrance exams to a conservatory. The only legal way for him to leave the country was to go to Poland, where his sister lived at the time. It was there that the Hungarian artist was finally free to develop his original minimalist music.

The destination of Esztényi’s migration was not typical compared to other composers from the Eastern Bloc, e.g. Arvo Pärt from Estonia or Sofia Gubaidulina from Russia, who both chose Germany. Both composers are associated with highly spiritual music based on simple proportions, but they came to their mature styles in very different ways, so their motifs for migration seem to be slightly different.

In his early years, Pärt (born in 1935) experimented with many modernist techniques that did not conform to official, conservative aesthetics. Religious inspirations were the last straw - his music was banned from being performed and he had no other choice than to emigrate. Arvo Pärt and his family left their country in 1980, first choosing Vienna (as Ligeti had done over 30 years before that) and eventually settling in Berlin.

Later, he developed the so-calledtintinnabulistyle - based on reduction and meditation - that brought him a lot of attention and a prestigious contract with the ECM music label. According to some databases, Pärt’s works are performed more often than the compositions of any other living composer, not to mention dozens of film soundtracks that feature his music.

In 2015, the Estonian composer decided to return to his homeland and establish his own music centre, opened in 2018 in a beautifully designed building among pine trees.

Sofia Gubaidulina was born in 1931 in Tatarstan, an autonomous Muslim province of what was then the USSR. After she moved from Kazan to Moscow, she co-established the Estreia group, which played and improvised on 'exotic' instruments from all corners of the vast country. In 1979, her music was harshly criticised by the USSR Union of Composers – however, she had to wait until the late 1980s and the success of herOffertoriumto get a chance to flee Russia.

'I was already sixty years old, my life was largely over, but at last I was able to compose freely what I wanted. All doors were opened. In Russia, everything was totally locked up, now I could easily get in touch with musicians, critics, the audience. This interaction is of vital importance to an artist. For the first time I was able to set myself really large-scale goals and realize them; my production has increased considerably (…) I could hear this clearer in Appen [in Germany], because I got a much better contact with nature. It is a hamlet with only two streets. There is a tree in front of my house and I have a little garden, so I am literally in nature. In Moscow, I was stuck in a small apartment surrounded by housing blocks and factories; at night everything was bathed in light. I always dreamed of the outdoors.'

Sofia Gubaidulina: 'Artists must fight the trivializing tendencies in society',Contemporary Classical – Thea Derks

Many of her subsequent works focused on transcendental values - including religious beliefs - and arithmetic proportions. She never returned to her home country. Gubaidulina lived in the small village of Appen, but the most attractive destination for many of her younger colleagues (Sergey Nevsky and Boris Filanovsky, among others) was the cosmopolitan Berlin, which continued to be an artistic centre even after the fall of the Iron Curtain.

Germany had played a key role in the system of new music since the 1920s. Its position was established, among other things, by the first festivals and associations organised under the patronage of the renowned Darmstadt Summer Courses for New Music. Berlin provided composers with numerous opportunities, such as scholarships (DAAD being one of the most prominent), residencies, commissions and funds (both regional and federal). Therefore, it is no coincidence that over several decades the city attracted musicians from all corners of the world – Argentina, South Korea, Romania, Poland and Russia.

One of the first composers to move to Berlin was Mauricio Kagel (1931-2008), a charismatic and witty artist born in Buenos Aires, who was only 25 when he left his home country. He became a prominent innovator of music theatre, added a lot of wit to the life of the avant-garde and provided a new perspective on the German tradition (e.g. inSankt-Bach Passion, an oratorio on J.S. Bach or the filmLudwig vanabout Beethoven).

In turn, the Korean composer Isang Yun (1917–1995) usually drew on the musical tradition of his own country. In his case, however, it was more than just a story of the migration from the periphery to the centre. In 1967, while in Berlin, Yun and his wife were kidnapped by the South Korean intelligence and transferred to Seoul, because several years earlier he visited North Korea on his own. He was accused of being a secret agent and sentenced to life imprisonment after a brief trial. He was released after two years – following the outrage of European and American intellectuals – and came back to Germany.

It is quite ironic that he was imprisoned by the USA's biggest ally in the Far East rather than by the communist regime. Nevertheless, Korean composers continued to choose Germany as their destination (Younghi Pagh-Paan and Unsuk Chin), whereas their Chinese counterparts preferred France (e.g. Quigang Chen, one of the last pupils of the great Olivier Messiaen).

Later, France and Germany saw a wave of Romanian spectral composers who were interested in the inner life of sound, esoteric vibrations and cosmic dimensions. Horatiu Radulescu (1942-2008) moved to Paris and then settled in Switzerland, while Iancu Dumitrescu (1944) and Ana-Maria Avram (1961-2017) lived in Germany. 
During the communist era, most artists based in Bucharest were under the surveillance of omnipotent secret services, the Securitate. However, even in the first years of capitalism in Romania, the current of new music was not a lucrative field, so composers migrated for economic reasons as much as for political ones (which was also partly the case with Gubaidulina).

European Union integration was another factor in the migrations: open borders allowed many composers to travel freely across Europe.Kaija Saariaho(1954) left Helsinki to study in Paris and became so connected to spectral aesthetics that she decided to stay there, similarly for a fellow Finn, Magnus Lindberg (1958). The Netherlands attracted many composers from Poland, e.g. Hanna Kulenty (1961) and Andrzej Kwieciński (1984).

In turn, Austria seemed to be an equally good destination both during the Cold War and in the times of the EU –Roman Haubenstock-Ramati, a Polish Jew, became a renowned professor at the Conservatory of Vienna and taught the next generations of both local and migrant artists, including Peter Ablinger, Beat Furrer and Paweł Szymański.

To what extent were the composers inspired by their native traditions and to what extent did they try to reflect the new environment? This question remains unanswered – and it is an interesting question indeed. Nevertheless, it seems that many Eastern authors established their position in Western music on the basis of their original inspirations.

Giya Kancheli, who left Georgia for the Netherlands, is often associated with spiritual and conservative currents in contemporary music, along with Panufnik, Pärt and Gubaidulina. Medieval-like, simple and meditative pieces (some of which refer to religious themes or use exotic timbres) written by these composers turned out to be especially appealing in times of the intensive secularisation of Europe.

Also, it has been suggested that the brutal force hidden in Xenakis's early orchestral oeuvres has lot to do with ancient Greek roots or that Ligeti's sense of surreal humour apparent in his vocal worksAventures, the operaLe Grand MacabreorPoème symphoniquefor 100 ticking metronomes is linked to his background. Of course, there is also a lot of stereotypical thinking that connects the distinct timbral aura of Saariaho's and Chen's work with their Finnish and Chinese origins, respectively.

Especially nowadays, the global character of new music has become so strong that it can incorporate a lot of the features earlier perceived as exotic on the common basis of the expansion of the sound universe, namely the introduction of new instruments, techniques, scales and rhythms.

If anyone could have predicted this process, it was surely Kagel in his pieceExoticafor a hundred of ethnic percussion instruments from all over the world, all unified injoi de jeux. It comes as no surprise that the piece was commissioned for and first performed at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich to serve as a symbol of globalisation.

European Museum of the Year

The Council of Europe Museum Prize

The European Museum Academy Art Museum Award

Art Fund Museum of the Year 2022

Årets Museum: Swedish Museum of the Year

Museum Prize in the Netherlands

Celebrating award-winning cultural heritage institutions

Over the past year and into 2023, a number of museums across Europe have won Museum of the Year prizes nationally, regionally and internationally.

Let's take a look at some award winning cultural heritage institutions.

The European Museum of the Year Award is presented each year in May by the European Museum Forum, an organisation which is part of the Council of Europe.

The European Museum of the Year for 2022 was theMuseum of the Mindin Haarlem in the Netherlands. It is a national museum for psychiatry, located in a building called Het Dolhuys which had been a hospital for centuries.

The European Museum Forum also annually awards the Council of Europe Museum Prize each December.

For 2022, this was won byNano Nagle Placein Cork, Ireland. This museum commemorates the educational and religious work of Nano Nagle, who founded schools in the 18th century for the Catholic poor in Cork at a time when it was illegal.

In 2023, the Council of Europe Museum Prize is being awarded to theWorkers Museumin Copenhagen, Denmark. The Workers Museum collects, researches and communicates the development of living and working conditions for Danish wage workers during the past 150 years, and the development of the Danish labour movement.

You can explore the museum's digitised collections on Europeana.

The European Museum Academy is a volunteer society of museum experts from across Europe. It awards a number of prizes, including the Art Museum Award which honours artistic projects that address current social issues.

In 2022, this was awarded to theLewis Glucksman Galleryin Cork, Ireland which has a collection of modern and contemporary Irish art. The judges for the award noted the gallery's excellence in curatorial practice, collections care and audience engagement which brings communities and artists together, to explore, visualise and express their thoughts and opinions on important societal issues.

In the United Kingdom, Art Fund annually award a Museum of the Year Prize each July. In 2022, this was won by theHorniman Museum and Gardensin Forest Hill in southeast London.

The Horniman opened in 1901 as a gift to the people from tea trader and philanthropist Frederick John Horniman, to 'bring the world to Forest Hill'. Today the Horniman has a collection of 350,000 objects, specimens and artefacts from around the world in natural history, music and anthropology as well as an aquarium and display gardens.

You can explore part of the Horniman's collection on Europeana.

Each spring, the Swedish Museums Association confers the Museum of the Year Award(Årets museum).

In 2022, this was awarded to theNational Museum, Sweden's art and design museum. Its collections comprise around 700,000 paintings, sculptures, miniatures, arts and crafts, designs, drawings, graphic sheets and portrait photographs from the 16th century to the present day. It won the award for showing how museums can make a difference by broadening the conversation about art and culture in society - work that reaches far beyond the walls of the museum.

We now remember Pablo Picasso as a leading artist of the 20th century, an important figure in modern art and the development of Cubism.

But there was a time in the 1910s when a younger Picasso was put on trial for the theft of the famousMona Lisapainting in a case that shockedParis, France and the wider world.

On August 21 1911, theMona Lisapainting vanished from theLouvre Museumin Paris.

It was a Monday, the museum was closed and its security was minimal. Painted in the early 1500s byLeonardo da Vinci, the artwork is now one of the most famous paintings in the world. But in the early 20th century, it was not as well-known. While today large queues of people wait to see theMona Lisawith tight security, at the time of the theft, the painting was not even bolted to the wall.

The robbery was only discovered on Tuesday morning when French artist Louis Béroud arrived at the Louvre intending to paint a copy of theMona Lisa. Finding an empty space on the wall, the security guards assumed other museum staff had removed the painting for photography, conservation or other research.

After searching the museum, security could not find the painting. The alarm was raised and the police were called.

The police again searched the Louvre - a museum with more than 1,000 rooms - as well as closing French borders. Every vehicle crossing the country's eastern border was examined.

Newspapers offered rewards for information about the robbery - which led to Pablo Picasso becoming a suspect.

Attracted by the cash reward, Honore-Joseph Géry Pieret - who had once been the secretary of poet and writer Guillaume Apollinaire, an associate of Picasso - confessed to a newspaper that, in 1907, he had stolen small Iberian sculptures from the Louvre and sold them to Picasso. Picasso actually used the face of one of the statues in his masterpieceLes Demoiselles d’Avignon.

By 1911, Pieret was broke and decided to return to the Louvre to steal more small objects to sell. Apollinaire and Picasso had also not been very discreet about owning the stolen statues.

This put Apollinaire and Picasso in the frame. Realising that they would be suspected of stealing theMona Lisa, both of them intended to throw the evidence - the small statues - into the Seine. In the end, they could not go through with it and gave them to a newspaper editor instead.

Within a few days, Apollinaire had been arrested on suspicion of stealing the painting, and, under questioning, confessed about Pieret and Picasso's prior thefts. The case ended up in court some days later with both Apollinaire and Picasso suspected of the crime. While Apollinaire confessed, Picasso initially denied everything, even that he knew Apollinaire.

Their emotional evidence and histrionic testimonies convinced Judge Henri Drioux that both men were innocent, and he dismissed the case only giving them a warning.

So, to answer the question, no, Pablo Picasso did not steal theMona Lisa. But, who did?

After many false leads and red herrings, two years later - in November 1913 -  the thief was caught trying to sell the priceless painting to an art dealer in Florence, Italy.

The culprit was Vincenzo Peruggia, an Italian who moved to Paris in his 20s. Peruggia was a handyman and had been a former employee of the Louvre.

In the end, he was convicted and given a relatively short sentence of just a year and fifteen days in prison. Upon appeal, his lawyers managed to get the sentence reduced to seven months.

And how did he pull off this audacious art heist? He hid in a broom closet until the museum closed on Sunday night and quietly took the portrait off the wall, slipped it under his coat and simply walked out.



--------------------------------------------------

Esperanto is the world's most widely spoken constructed language. Developed in the late 19th century, it was intended to be an auxiliary language for international communication.

Esperanto was first proposed in 1887 with the publication in Warsaw, Poland, of a book in Russian entitled Международный языкъ: предисловие и полный учебник (International Language: An Introduction and Complete Manual). Esperantists now know this asLa Unua Libro(The First Book).

The book, which was rather a booklet, contained a theoretical introduction to the language and six example texts, some of which were translations and others were original. It also contained the 16 basic rules of the language's grammar and a short dictionary with 917 entries.

The book's author appeared under the pseudonym D-ro Esperanto, a name which in the international language means 'Doctor Hopeful'. It was soon widely known that the author was a young medical doctor from Warsaw, L. L. Zamenhof, born in a Jewish family that lived in the part of Poland then under the Russian Empire. The author's pseudonym later became used as a name for the language itself.

The work appeared shortly afterwards in Polish, German, French and English.

Many readers found the new language interesting and started learning it. In 1888, several hundred people were learning the language all over Europe and even as far away as the United States. In 1889 a Directory was published with the names and addresses of more than a thousand Esperantists.

Esperanto clubs and societies were soon established. By 1889, the first periodical,La Esperantisto(The Esperantist) was founded. Since then, more than 14,000 journals and magazines have been published about the history of the Esperanto movement, as documented in 2019 byBibliografio de periodaĵoj en aŭ pri Esperanto(A Bibliography of Periodicals in or about Esperanto).

TheFirst Bookcontains the first literary efforts in the language, and other authors soon followed Zamenhof's example. Literary activity was mostly devoted at first to the translation of classical works of world literature into Esperanto. This allowed the language to grow and to prove its effectiveness in this field. Original Esperanto literature developed with time and various literary schools appeared.

The first international Esperanto meeting took place in 1904 in Calais (France), where several dozen French and British Esperantists met to study the possibility of organising a more formal event. The first international association, theTutmonda Esperanto-Ligo(World Esperanto League) was established the following year, which convened, also in 1905, the first World Congress in Boulogne-sur-Mer, France.

This meeting was hugely successful. It reasserted the confidence of the language's enthusiasts in its possibilities as a real means of communication, as opposed to a merely theoretical one. It also encouraged the repetition of similar meetings in the following years.

Since then more than 100 World Esperanto Congresses have been held on successive years, except during both World Wars, and- including those in 2020 and 2021 which were virtual, due to the pandemic. It's a time-honoured tradition to include all participants in a group 'Congress photo'.

The Esperanto community has had its own symbols from the start. The green star was proposed in 1892, through the magazineLa Esperantisto, as a sign for the mutual recognition of speakers of Esperanto. The star's five points represent the continents (five, as per the geographical ideas of the period). The flag of Esperanto was originally that of the Boulogne-Sur-Mer Esperanto club. In the World Congress held there in 1905, it was adopted as the language's official flag. The green field represents hope and the white canton with a green star represents peace.

The Esperanto movement also has its own anthem,La Espero(Hope), with words by Zamenhof. It has been played and sung with more than twenty different melodies, but the best known one by far is that composed by Félicien de Ménil.

Esperantists have always been very keen on relating and getting in touch with people of other countries. In the early years of the language, an active correspondence was established among Esperantist penfriends by postal mail, and today, this is even more intense by email and social media.

The Esperanto movement became organised quite early. TheUniversala Esperanto-Asocio(UEA, World Esperanto Association) was established in 1908, aspiring to unite the language's users outside national organisations, working for mutual help and the practical use of the language. The UEA was founded by two young Swiss men, Hector Hodler and Edmont Privat.

The UEA is still the main organisation in the Esperanto movement, even though its nature and operations have changed noticeably since then.

Some time later, in the 1920s, sectors of the then thriving workers' movement saw the possibilities of Esperanto for the advancement of the so-called proletarian internationalism and they created their own Esperanto organisations. In the context of the World Congress which took place in Prague in 1921 a new organisation was founded by workers who proposed to use Esperanto as a tool in their struggle. The organisation was calledSennaciecia Asocio Tutmonda(SAT, World Anational Association), and it accommodated (and it still does) many diverse tendencies in the wide field of labour ideologies, such as socialists, communists and anarchists among others. SAT has long played a major role in the spread of Esperanto among the popular classes; it has its own peculiar character and performs a valuable cultural work.

The current Esperanto movement follows the steps of those early pioneers.

The movement has been through times of crisis as the result of political persecution, of world globalisation and the hegemony of the USA after World War 2. All this, plus the concept of English as the newlingua francaof humankind, resulted in a loss of interest about Esperanto.

But, in recent times, there has been a new surge of interest about the language, associated especially with the opportunities for communication afforded by the new technologies. The number of international contacts and meetings has grown considerably, and cooperation between people from different countries  has reached levels that the early Esperantists could barely imagine.

Besides, many people have observed that the use of a national language in international relations provides an unfair advantage for the native speakers of that particular language, as well as economical, prestige and power benefits for their countries. All these limitations to a really democratic communication have opened a new space for Esperanto, whose most outstanding feature is precisely its neutrality.

A chat with Roberto Capone, paper-mâché craftsman

If you happen to be in Rome and take a walk in the Testaccio district, you might stumble upon 'The City of the Other Economy' (theCittà dell’Altra Economia). This 'city within a city' focuses on environmentally friendly practices, centring humanity and nature. Within this incubator of innovation sits a little shop that is filled to the brim with an army of gigantic paper-mâché animals: horses, elephants, fish, sheep… The artisan leading this shop, Roberto, told us his story.

Roberto, how did you approach the papier-mâché trade?

I discovered the art of paper-mâché eleven years ago, quite by accident. At the time I was running a toy and educational material store, but the shop closed over the summer and there was little else to do. One summer day I got the idea of making a cardboard dog for my little son. I decided to build the Bremen Town Musicians: the donkey, the dog, the cat and the rooster, all stacked on top of each other. After several hours of work a sculpture standing 1.80 meters tall emerged, all made of cardboard which I lined with paper-mâché in the following days. In the past, I had worked extensively in the theatre in the assembly of sets, so I had some experience in dealing with large decor structures.

My paper-mâché musicians had only been in my shop window for a few days when a school director entered, wanting to buy the sculpture from me! I obliged and kept building other cardboard animals lined with paper-mâché, without thinking that one day they would consume my life. My cardboard zoo garnered quite a lot of attention on social media, and more and more people started asking me to organise workshops and events about crafting using paper-mâché.

At first, I was very hesitant, but in the end, I decided to organise a paper-mâché animal painting workshop. With an army of medium-sized giraffes, I faced twenty rather small children who, as soon as they saw the animals, launched their creative assault. This first workshop made me realise the potential of these events.

My animals are 3D sculptures, giving infinite freedom to children to paint as they please, to get dirty and give free rein to their imagination. At first, I gave them guidelines, but then I realised that it was better to leave room for their creativity and therefore my only remaining rule is to have respect for each other. The results of our workshops are magnificent art installations that we integrate into the surrounding landscape: parks, living rooms, streets, squares… The installations are temporary, and the animals are reused several times, restored, and sometimes modified. The first giraffe, which we still use in the workshops, is eleven years old and I don't even know how many times it has been painted, restored, and modified.

Animals – or rather 'animal cartoons' – are our strong suit, but we also do cityscapes, trees, pirates, etc.

Over time, I also started teaching the paper-mâché technique to young people and adults: in the beginning, I thought that my strength was the knowledge of my hands, but then I realized that in order to teach I had to acquire a method to transmit my knowledge constructively.

Do you work alone or together with other craftspeople?

At first, I was alone, but over time the workshop expanded to accommodate other paper-mâché makers who work full-time and collaborators who support us in the laboratories. My son Andrea has also recently joined, to whom I try to pass on the secrets of the art. He started from the bottom, trying his hand at restoring animals, but he is already bringing a breath of innovation to his workshop, in fact, he is experimenting with the creation of new forms - he loves elephants - and in the design of new series, inspired by cartoons and manga. Just now, he is working on the creation of a Naruto sword.

What kind of materials do you need?

The basic material is cardboard, there are different qualities and types, I prefer corrugated cardboard which facilitates the modelling of shapes. Then we need paper scotch tape, plenty of PVA glue and newspapers. Nowadays, fewer and fewer people read the news on paper, but luckily some that prefer the nostalgia of 'real' newspapers provide us with materials for our craft. Sometimes we also use recycled materials for special finishes.

Can you support yourself with this activity?

It was hard at the beginning, but I have to say that today we can support ourselves thanks to our courses, workshops, and participation in projects, festivals, street initiatives, and activities in schools. We operate mostly by word of mouth, and the quality of our work is our best calling card, but today we must add the acquisition of new skills to the hard work of craftsmanship that often take time away from the real activity: photography, videography, social media management. Even the craftsperson, in order to survive and keep up with the times, cannot avoid keeping up with the digital transition.

Storytelling through symbols

Symbols and attributes of Saints and the Evangelists

Heraldry and symbols

Learn about the symbolic significance of medieval imagery

The word ‘iconography’ refers to the use of symbols or visual representations to convey meaning. The term originates from the Greekeikonographia,eikon(image) andgraphia(description), a description through images. The medieval period provided fascinating and beautiful artworks, many of which would have been highly prized for their materiality and significance. However, these objects offer more complex insights into the medieval period than their aesthetic beauty. These objects are adorned with imagery and symbolism similar to those in manuscript illuminations and existed to educate, tell a story or allow religious beliefs to be shared. In the medieval period, convention on the use of symbols was closely associated with their repetition in religious texts.

The symbols of sociological, cultural and more often theological significance used on these medieval objects often narrate a historical event, indicate a Saint or an Evangelist, or indicate the patronage of the object. Conformity on the use and meaning of these symbols meant that those with low literacy could read the object and do so with or without accompanying text. Thus, in a time of relative illiteracy during the Middle Ages, these symbols could be used to visually communicate a message.

Many of the symbols evident on medieval objects are similar in style and form to those contained in the manuscript illustrations of the period. The painted Triptych above illustrates how text and symbols were combined to communicate a message; here the symbols and images honour a cleric who is seen within various biblical scenes. When the doors are closed the priest is kneeling, the skull of Adam is illustrative of his mortality.  Other symbols include Saint Anthony represented by the pig, a bell and a book, the tethered monkey signifying evil impulses, the sign of the cross or Tau on the foreheads of those being saved and the serpent indicating evil or sin. An inscription on the panel reads ‘Clapt, clapt, indi het snapt’, an old Dutch proverb meaning: ‘Hurrah! Hurrah! If you get this’.

Colours that were used in illuminated manuscripts also held symbolic significance, such as purple being associated with great wealth.

Storytelling was an important part of medieval life. The spoken word was integral to the sharing of oral histories, circulating the news of significant historical events or used to spread the word of God. Many objects told their stories through illustrated scenes, recounting moments in history through symbolism and imagery. One such example evident on many medieval objects is the killing of Thomas á Beckett in a Canterbury Cathedral in 1170 by knights loyal to King Henry II. This event changed the course of the European High Middle Ages and turned Canterbury Cathedral into an important pilgrimage site. Following his death and internment in Canterbury Cathedral, accompanying miraculous healings resulted in Thomas á Beckett being canonised. The story of his death adorns many medieval objects such as the wax seal impression and manuscript below, on which the saint is identified by the simple symbol of the sword.

Below:A seal impression in wax showing, on one side, the martyrdom of St Thomas à Becket and on the other, the Virgin and Child (statue) in a shrine with open doors.

Stories from the bible were also identified or told through symbols. In this way, those who had low levels of literacy could be given visual clues from the images when reading texts. Missionaries or teachers could also use symbols to help to preach and they were integral in allowing the viewer to identify stories from the bible thus aiding passages of text to memory.

Sharing stories of the saints was important in spreading the Christian faith, showing how saints lived their lives, how they lived the word of God through their actions and the events that enabled them to be canonised.

Saints were easily identifiable by their symbols or attributes. The scallop shell has always been the emblem of St. James, its lines representing the routes that pilgrims would follow, converging in Santiago de Compostela and the tomb of Saint James. Travellers would wear the symbol on their habit to indicate that they had been successful in their pilgrimage. Similarly, this flask in the shape of a shell was used to carry holy water brought back from shrines by pilgrims. In the manuscript below, St. James holds a staff adorned with the scallop shell.

The four Evangelists also had distinct emblems: Matthew the winged man or angel, Mark the winged lion, Luke the winged bull and John the eagle. Many of the Apostles had multiple attributes which came from important stories from their lives. The life of St. Peter was given distinct attributes such as the Keys of Heaven, a boat, a fish and a cockerel as seen in the staff head and manuscript below. The cockerel was to signify the Denial of Peter, the prediction by Jesus at The Last Supper that Peter would deny him before the cockerel crowed at first light.

The use and identification of symbols of heraldry expanded during the Middle Ages and similarly became a language all of its own. Some manuscripts were produced for Royal or wealthy patrons, which made expensive decoration and illustrious illuminations possible.

These patrons were identified through their heraldic symbols, in the form of animals, colours and objects. One example can be seen on the tapestry below. The stork here is an allegory for Spring, but it was also used to symbolise righteousness due to the stork’s ability to kill snakes (a sign of evil). The unicorn here is a symbol of Christ who was put to death, and the noble and brave lion eludes to the nature of the family.

Family life

Journalism career

Brazil

Mixed race and lesbian writer and activist who fought for equality

Portuguese journalist and writer Virgínia Quaresma was one of the first woman to work as a journalist in Portugal. In a time of great discrimination, she lived her life openly as a lesbian and was an important figure in Portugal's feminist movement.

She was one of the first women in Portugal to graduate with a degree in Letters. She is known for her contribution to the development of modern journalism and activism for a variety of social and political causes.

Born in 1882 in Elvas, a town on the border between Portugal and Spain, she was the youngest of her parent's three children. Her father was an army officer and her mother was a domestic worker, who was descended from enslaved people from Africa.

Educated alongside her brothers, at age 18, Quaresma began studying a course in primary education inLisbonand later studied Letters at the University of Lisbon.

Her journalist career followed.

From the 1900s onwards, she began to publish more and more articles on women's issues, such as suffrage, access to divorce and equal pay and professions.

Virginia Quaresma was the kind of journalist who went out to find the news.

Instead of staying in an office, she went to where events took place to interview people and gather information. This seems common today, but it was new in the Portuguese and Brazilian press at the time.

At the turn of the century, Quaresma was among the leading feminists inPortugal. She worked for feminist journals such asO Mundo—Jornal da Mulher, arguing for equal rights in all spheres of society. She wrote for the journalSociedade Futura(Future Society).

In 1907, she became the editor of magazineAlma Feminina, aimed specifically at female audiences.

Several years later, she was appointed to a public commission to study women's education in France, Italy, Switzerland and Germany.

In the mid-1910s, along with her partner Maria da Cunha, shemoved to Brazil, expanding her journalist career to two countries and continents.

She returned from Brazil in 1915. However, by the 1930s, when the Estado Novo dictatorship regime began in Portugal, Quaresma was in a relationship with Maria Luiza Vallat da Silva Passos. Virgínia and Maria decided to move to Rio de Janeiro in 1933.

Virgínia again returned to Portugal in the 1960s, where she continued to write.

Virgínia Quaresma died in 1973, and is remembered today as one of the first figures in feminism and journalism in Portugal and Brazil, with her name being given to streets, prizes and her image on postage stamps.

FRIEND starts work

First gay grant

Transvestite/Transsexual Group

Good Friends Disco

Decades of support

50th anniversary

50 years of community support and services

London Friend is the UK's oldest lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans charity, established 50 years ago in 1972. It supports the health and mental wellbeing of the LGBT community in and around London, through counselling, training and social and support groups.

To mark their 50th anniversary, the charity has published awebsite detailing a timeline of their five decades. In this blog, we look back to the 1970s to see how the charity developed in its first decade.

London Friend stems from a meeting held in April 1971 when the Campaign for Homosexual Equality (CHE) saw a need for an advice and counselling service which would support and befriend gay people. 120 people attended CHE's first pan-London meeting where a working party was set up. This later took the name Fellowship for the Relief of the Isolated and Emotionally in Need and Distress (FRIEND), the beginnings of the London Friend charity.

Not long after, it moved to its first premises at The Centre, a community counselling project in Marylebone.

By 1972, Friend was hard at work, operating a telephone line, staffed by volunteers and open for calls on evenings from Monday to Friday. Just a few months later, there were fifty volunteers nationwide, supported by twelve professional therapists. The London operation at the Centre was open seven nights a week, plus there were Friend branches in Manchester, Liverpool and Cambridge, with more in Cardiff and Leeds about to open.

In February 1975, London Friend was awarded an Urban Aid grant. This is thought to be the first government grant ever to be awarded to a gay-led organisation and was considered so controversial that the Home Secretary, Roy Jenkins, personally steered the grant through. The announcement was reported on the front page of Gay News.

The grant was jointly awarded by the British Home Office and Islington Council. London Friend received nearly £40,000, paid over five years.

The grant meant that London Friend were able to move to shop front premises in Islington, and enabled the charity to employ their first paid worker, Roland Jeffery, who was taken on as a full-time paid administrator.

Other smaller - but nonetheless important! - expenditures for things such as equipment, transport, and advertising were covered by the grant.

In October 1976, London Friend started making their building available as the regular meeting place for the Transvestite/Transsexual Group, (TV/TS group). London Friend's 1979 Annual Report described this development as 'part of Friend's concern for sexual minorities who are largely not understood and for whom there are few facilities available.'

The group held meetings every Saturday and Sunday (and eventually Friday) evening, which were described as 'very informal affairs: just a friendly social gathering, although there is always someone to help, counsel, or advise.'

This mixture of socialising and support characterised the Group's activities over the years, with boat trips, annual dinner and dances and a pen-pal service on offer as well as helplines, befriending and a self-published booklet for the partners and families of transvestites.

In 1979, London Friend held three fundraising ‘GOOD FRIENDS DISCOS’ at the Angel & Crown, an Islington pub on consecutive Saturday nights in September and October.

They were organised in support of a 'premises appeal' that was launched at a point when London Friend's funding from Islington Council was under threat and their lease was up for renegotiation. The events raised £70 in total, with between 45 and 80 people attending each night. The discos were also chances for London Friend members and service users to socialise and make connections, as well as increase community awareness of the organisation's work.

From these origins in the 1970s, London Friend's work has continued through several decades. It navigated the beginning of the AIDS pandemic in the 1980s, increasing racial equality and inclusion from the 1990s to more societal acceptance and equal marriage in the 2010s.

During these times, London Friend has adapted to meet changing needs and remain relevant for the LGBTQ+ community. In 2011, London Friend took over the management of the Antidote LGBTQ+ drug and alcohol project, a service which includes programmes to address the needs around chemsex affecting gay and bisexual men that have emerged over recent years.

In 2022 London Friend celebrated its 50th birthday with a year of heritage activities. You can explore the charity's history through timelines, people and images on their website.

For five decades, it has supported the health and wellbeing of the LGBTQ+ community mostly through the efforts of its volunteers, supported by its dedicated team of staff. London Friend is needed as much now as ever and looks forward to continuing for another 50 years.

Analogue animation: Motion in immobility

Analogue photography: The materialism of a moment in time

Capturing a moment in time in a still frame has long been something humanity has tried to do, from cave drawings to digital photography. Today AI can replicate or produce digital imagery within minutes, but let's start at the beginning and take a look at some of the developments of the analogue camera before moving our gaze to more contemporary use and ideas for the future.

For some, the history of the camera takes root in ancient China and Greece: both employed simple optical devices known as thecamera obscura. The camera obscura had the ability to project real-life images onto surfaces. For many years the camera obscura took different shapes and sizes and served different purposes, yet the camera would not come to capture an image in a photograph until the 19th century.

It was during the 1800s that France and Britain were in a race to be the first to develop a photograph. The French won this race by developing an image on metal, but the British were the first to succeed in developing a photograph on paper. Though both the British and French inventions were relatively successful, it wasn’t until the Americans joined in on the development of cameras that things started to drastically change.

The birth of mass photography took place in 1884 with the invention of the photographic roll. This meant that cameras could start to be mass-produced. However, it wasn’t until the 20th century, with the invention of the portable camera, that the wider populace started to take notice, and the camera became more common.

Since this time there have been many developments within analogue cameras, such as the advent of SLRs. But the instant camera, giving anyone the ability to be in any location and develop an image almost immediately, was a huge step for the average consumer.

During this time there were those who thought to expand the features of analogue cameras with the goal to do more than simply take still images. Animation was one of these features: with analogue cameras, you needed to go through the demanding process of capturing minuscule movement picture by picture. Ranging from making hand-drawn images move, to stop motion clay figures, to eventually the invention of the movie camera, animation has taken many shapes and sizes. Check out the following video for an insight into the process:

Analogue animation: dreams in motion

In our current age of digital photography, there are still those who yearn for a time when analogue photography was still the only option.

Dana Lixenberg (who you can see at work in the video below) is a professional who has only ever worked with analogue photography. One of the challenges facing analogue photographers today is that the materials that make these cameras and camera rolls are getting harder to find and are more scarcely produced every year.

Analogue photography: the iconic world amagazines and the work of Dana Lixenberg

How will analogue photography come to take shape in the future? Scarcity often leads to increasing costs of materials. Will 'outdated' analogue photography become a mere hobbyist pastime for the wealthy, pushing artists further to the sidelines of their own profession, or will there potentially be a renaissance, a renewed interest of sorts that will bring it back to the masses? Whatever the answer may be, it is going to be interesting to see where analogue photography goes from here.

The Agnellis, an Italian dynasty

The Agnellis, Fiat and power

Founded in Turin in July 1899, Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino has over the decades expanded its field of interest to become one of the most important Italian private financial groups.

During the Fascist period, relations between the Turin company and the regime were very close. But if on the one hand the autarchic policy advocated by Mussolini helped Fiat to expand enormously on the domestic market, on the other hand it almost completely slowed its development abroad. However, if before the Second World War, Fiat was in thirtieth place by capitalization among Italian industries, after the armistice it permanently occupied the third place.

The war left on the ground a heap of rubble and a production that had stopped ten years earlier; but Vittorio Valletta first and Gianni Agnelli later were able to revive the Italian company. Already in 1949, one of the cars that will have greater success in the following years was launched on the market: the 500, a prototype of which had already been presented in 1936, and which together with the slightly larger model, the 600, will become the iconographic representation of the Italian economic boom.

Over the years, many other cars will follow, from the 850, launched in 1964, to the 124, the 126 and then the Regata, the Ritmo, the Panda, the Uno, all cars that will make the Turin company fortune.

Gianni Agnelli was president of the Turin company from 1966 to 1996, the year in which he will leave the leadership to Cesare Romiti, although he will continue to take care of the family business until his death in January 2003. During the 30 years of his leadership, Fiat increased the multinational and multi-sector vocation of the company: the foreseeable close relations with the United States were joined by the openings to the Soviet market in the sixties, and then the 1976 agreement by which Fiat ceded 10% of the shares to Colonel Gaddafi's Libya in exchange for 415 million dollars, fresh money that the Turin-based company greatly needed.

The 2000s mark, thanks to the figure of Sergio Marchionne, the last turning point at FIAT: the acquisition of Chrysler first, and the transformation into FCA, mark the birth of a new story.

For the average Italian, born and raised in this country in the second half of the last century, the lawyer Agnelli with the soft r pronunciation, impeccable manners and the watch fastened above the cuff is Fiat; and Fiat is Turin with the Mirafiori plants and the blue collars at work; Fiat is the union struggles, the hot autumn and then the march of the 40,000 in 1980, which marked the biggest defeat of the Italian union after a decade of important achievements.

Fiat is also Juventus, the most loved and most hated team on the Italian football scene, the one that wins everything because it has the best champions according to its fans, and the referees always on its side according to its detractors; Fiat are Italian cars, first most of them, and then all of them.

Finally, Fiat is power, state aid, the always guaranteed layoffs, the construction of highways that will end up mortifying rail transport in Italy, giving cars and trucks a record unknown anywhere else in Europe.

Jacek Kamiński and his family have been artfully crafting shoes in Warsaw for over seventy years

Buying and wearing shoes has become such a normal part of life nowadays that we often don't think about how or where they were made. Fast fashion and sweatshop capitalism has far removed us from the products we consume, although there are still some that hone and keep the craft of slowly, meticulously creating footwear by hand. This is how shoes have been crafted for centuries, as can be seen in this 16th Century illustration in the Behem Codex Manuscript, showing a shoemaking workshop in Krakow.

We visited a present-day artisanal shoecrafting workshop to meet Jacek Kamiński, a Warsaw shoemaker whose family has been creating shoes in Warsaw since 1943.

Jacek’s workshop is a kind of a museum, the walls of his small studio are filled with shoes, between which there are numerous diplomas, decorations and old photographs.

Even though Jacek initially wanted to become a physicist, he became a shoemaker, and he does not regret this decision at all. He started his profession in the workshop of his uncle Bruno after graduating from high school in 1979. It was his uncle who told him that there are many physicists in the world, but few shoemakers.

Jacek's workshop creates and repairs shoes for anyone who walks in, and he assures us he has had some famous clients in the past. The most prestigious client Jacek ever worked for was when he aided his uncle in sewing shoes for pope John Paul II. Jacek has also made footwear for many films, including “Quo Vadis”, “The Witcher”, “The Pianist”,  and  many other less known outside Poland. His work was also appreciated by Warsaw theaters lincluding the Roma Theater, the Grand Theater the Warsaw Royal Opera and the Berlin Opera.

Bruno Kamiński, the founder of theArtistic Workshop – Handmade Shoesin Warsaw in 1943, after being an apprentice of master shoemakers from Gdynia and Warsaw. During the Warsaw Uprising (in the summer of 1944)  he was captured and sent to the Dachau concentration camp. Luckily, he survived and returned to Warsaw, which by then had been totally destroyed by the war.

Soon after World War II, Bruno had to close his shop once more due to the negative effects Stalinism had on Poland’s independence and private business. Fortunately, Bruno’s skills were appreciated by the Grand Theater, where he became interested in historical footwear, sewing shoes for many performances. It was this period that made him a true shoe artist. He also made shoes for the top fashion house Moda Polska (Polish Fashion) active in between 1958 and 1998.

Soon Bruno's skills were noticed by Nina Andrycz, wife of the powerful politician Józef Cyrankiewicz, who was prime minister of Poland between 1947 and 1970. Bruno’s fame grew so much that the wife of Władysław Gomułka, the First Secretary of the Polish United Workers’ Party, began to order shoes from him. She had small feet which made it hard for her to find shoes, so she especially appreciated Bruno's services.

One day Bruno was visited by two “sad men”, as the secret police were called. They weren’t very talkative and just told Bruno to come with them. People knew that this meant a special interrogation, most often with arrest and imprisonment. He was only allowed to take a tape measure with him. To Bruno's surprise, he was taken to Władysław Gomułka himself, the most important person in Poland at the time. Gomułka ordered shoes from Bruno, and paid him well for his work and for the shoes he had made for Gomułka's wife.

Bruno decided to show his talents on the international stage. He prepared a shoe in the form of a jet which he sent to the World Shoe Exhibition in Munich in 1957. Unfortunately, due to a lack of proper communication, Bruno did not read the competition terms and sent only one shoe instead of a pair of shoes. His work should have been disqualified, but the airplane shoe stood out so much that the jury decided to award him a silver medal. The shoe can now be seen at the Museum of the Leather Craft Guild in Warsaw.

For the next competition in 1958, Bruno prepared high-heeled shoes decorated with an orchid made of multi-colored leather. This time, meeting all the requirements of the competition, the shoes gained the full recognition of the jury, which unquestionably awarded a gold medal to shoes decorated with colorful orchids.

If you want to have really special, unique shoes for yourself, you canvisit Jacek Kamiński’s studiolocated on the central street of Warsaw, Nowy Świat 22. This tiny pavilion and tiny shop has no colourful logos or screaming advertisements, but remains a hidden gem worth visiting. Many foreign customers come here to order their dream shoes and get them shipped internationally to their homes.

Consolidating power

Ceaușescu becoming president and Salvador Dali`s reaction

The first and only Romanian President with a sceptre

After a reign in Romania which lasted almost two decades, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej`s death in 1965 sparked a struggle for political supremacy amongst members of the Romanian Workers' Party.

Ceaușescu was elected officially as the new leader of the Romanian Communist Party in 1965. From that moment on, the new leader in Bucharest started to consolidate his political power. He dismissed Gheorghiu Dej`s closest allies from key positions within the Party, and replaced them with his own trusted people, reorganising the institutional basis of the Party.

One of the most important decisions made at the 9th Communist Party Congress in July 1965, an event which formally installed Ceaușescu as the new leader, was to rename the Romanian Workers Party (a structure created in 1948 through the union of the Communist Party of Romania and the Social-Democrat Party – in fact the dissolution of the Social-Democratic Party) to the Romanian Communist Party. In doing this, Ceaușescu was making a statement that Romania was entering a new era and embracing socialism.

From an institutional point of view, during Gheorghiu Dej`s time, the Party was led by a structure called the Political Bureau. Ceaușescu changed this framework by replacing the Political Bureau with an Executive Committee composed of a higher number of members – creating the illusion of a reformist leader with a more democratic ethos. The Executive Committee also elected a newly created Permanent Presidium which consisted of a narrow group, loyal to Ceaușescu, who was in fact the true leader of the Party.

According to the Constitution of 1965, the Communist Party was the leading political force in Romania. The state was ruled by the Council of State which, in turn, was led by a president. Nicolae Ceaușescu was the President of the Council of State starting from 1967. But until 1974, the function of the President of Romania, as such, did not exist. It was then when Ceaușescu decided to totally take the formal control of the state by modifying the Constitution and creating the position of President of Romania. Of course, this was a decision aiming to consolidate his image both internally and externally. Even so, the moment when he assumed his new role embodied something special.

It is common knowledge that a sceptre is a symbol of rule and a token of monarchies. By trying to establish a connection with Romania's past, Ceaușescu became the first president to bear a sceptre. Ceaușescu’s election ceremony, paired with the moment when he received the sceptre, was broadcast live, containing footage that was both shocking and hilarious at the same time.

The image of Ceaușescu with a sceptre rapidly reached the worldwide news, making it – as we would say today – viral. Many reactions and controversies were generated but one of them is undoubtedly worth mentioning. On seeing the footage, the famous artist Salvador Dali sent a telegram to Ceaușescu “congratulating” him. The text of the telegram is as hilarious as the event in itself:

‘I deeply appreciate your historic act of establishing the presidential sceptre.’

The hilarious event went one step further when the authorities from Bucharest decided to publish Dali’s telegram in the official newspaper of the Communist Party, Scînteia, oblivious to the telegram’s ironic message.
Amusing as it may seem, the dictatorship of Nicolae Ceaușescu became fully established through the presidential sceptre.

Hats for women were wildly popular, until they weren't. Find out what happened to women's headwear throughout the last century!

Head coverings have always been a symbol by which people could be recognised and are important in denoting social status, religion, nationality or political beliefs. We might wear a hat to mark our identity, or purely for aesthetic reasons.

At the beginning of the 19th century, when clothes were straight cut, with simple outline lines and less demanding construction, fashion-conscious women covered their heads with caps made of silk muslin or cotton decorated with lace or embroidery. On summer days it was fashionable to wear straw hats decorated with ribbons and flowers.

Towards the end of the 19th century, clothing gradually became more layered, voluminous and structurally complex. Hats also evolved in shape, height, width, type of decoration, material and position on the head.

Various styles of hats were advertised through fashion magazines that democratised fashion and made style trends widely available.

The development of women's hats runs parallel to the development of the fashion or milliner craft.

Unlike the hatter, this craft is younger and approaches the making of hats artistically and decoratively, and not only with the purpose of protection. Milliner was a typically female occupation that was initially associated with tailoring and whose development, like the development of fashion clothing, was initially linked to the court.

Queen Marie Antoinette's favourite dressmaker Rose Bertin was also a very skilled milliner. Her headdresses were made of straw, lace and decorative ribbons, and were sometimes shaped like small wearable sculptures.

Throughout the 19th century, the art of making hats became more and more appreciated, and the milliner craft provided women with safe and respectable employment.

The first famous milliner was Caroline Reboux who, like Charles Worth, was discovered by the then-fashionista Princess Pauline von Metternich.

The hat, as a fashion accessory, became popular in the 20th century. Around 1900, dress etiquette dictated that a woman should not leave the house without a hat.

Owning and wearing a unique model of hat signified the wealth and social status of the wearer. Women's hats, therefore, came in many shapes, colours and materials, while men's hats retained a classic style and shape.

Throughout the first half of the 20th century, milliners honed their craft and creativity to make headgear in even more sizes, shapes and colours.

From elegant bell-shaped hats to Elsa Schiaparelli's fantastic hats in the shape of shoes, hands or lamb chops. Fashion magazine Vogue declared that hats should be 'the crazier, the better'!

After World War II, fashion accessories, and especially the hat, tried to return to their pre-war importance.

By this time, in a lot of cultures, the importance of headgear as a social obligation had made way for wearing hats as purely a sense of personal taste. By the end of the 1960s, with the emergence of countercultural movements that aimed to reject and redefine social rules, the popularity of hats had severely diminished.

How three organisations promote Black participation in politics

In the 20th century, a number of political movements and organisations began to promote the rights and highlight the experiences of Black people living in Europe.

This guest blog by Marisa Pickett, a graduate student at the University of New Mexico, focuses on three movements in France, Germany and the United Kingdom highlighting the role of democracy and advocacy.

From 1950-1956, FEANF organised meetings of groups of African students in France to create a unified voice against colonialism and Western imperialism. Originally independent of all French political parties, FEANF aided in the formation of communist organisations in Francophone Africa.

In 1952, FEANF's leadership was helmed by members of the African Democratic Rally (RDA) and became an affiliate of the larger International Union of Students (IUS). By 1956, the group began to demand African independence from colonial rule more radically and provoked the ire of the French government.

Generation ADEFRA: Schwarze Frauen in Deutschland - Generation ADEFRA: Black Women in Germany

Established in 1986 and originally based in Munich, ADEFRA (Afro-DeutscheFrauen) was a feminist organisation for the mobilisation of Black women and women of colour in Germany.

Now Berlin-based, the re-titled Generation ADEFRA continues the original mission of the organisation by holding meetings, workshops and events based around highlighting the existence of Black-Europeans and their experiences.

Operation Black Vote

Operation Black Vote works to ensure greater racial justice throughout the United Kingdom by promoting the engagement of Black voters.

It was founded at the UK Parliament in 1996 as a collaboration between Charger88 and the 1990 Trust, two organisations which work to promote democratic reform, policy and research.

Operation Black Voteis today a nationally recognised organisation, focused on political education, participation, representation and the promotion of equality and human rights.

For more information on Black movements around Europe, check outENPAD – European Network for People of African Descent. Co-organised alongside theEuropean Network Against Racism (ENAR), ENPAD is a network of organisations with shared goals that seeks to highlight the amount of anti-Black racism in Europe.

StarandAjoblanco: loudspeakers of the counterculture

The ‘Movida’

With the death of Francisco Franco in November 1975 after 39 years of dictatorship, Spain began a process of political evolution, called la Transición, towards a system comparable to the European democracies. This process would affect many spheres of Spanish society and especially young people, who had already started to demand freedoms that Franco’s regime had denied them in the final years of his dictatorship.

The influence of American counterculture, pacifist protests against the Vietnam War, and the new rock and punk trends coming from the United Kingdom left a mark on the Spanish youth, who began to demand greater political freedom at university. At the same time, in the peripheral neighbourhoods of Barcelona and Madrid – which had been hard hit by the economic crisis of the 1970s and were more socially aware – a countercultural movement emerged that would express itself through its own publications.

Magazines and fanzines proliferated as a vehicle for expressing disenchantment against a system from which young people felt more and more alienated. Despite the continuous problems with censorship in the last years of Franco’s regime, which subjected many such publications to closures and bans, they were the main mouthpiece of a youth that tried to create their own cultural channels in opposition to the official culture, which had no room for their concerns.

Of all these publications, the magazinesStarandAjoblancowere the most influential exponents of Spanish counterculture, but from different points of view.Star, initially dedicated to comics, evolved towards music and film criticism, reports and interviews, always outside the official channels, reaching a circulation of 25,000 copies.Ajoblanco, which achieved a circulation of 100,000, had a more libertarian slant, and kept its focus on political and social analysis.

Under the protection of the new freedoms, which they managed to broaden, in its pages they openly talked about those subjects that had been forbidden and which the official culture did not want to cover, such as rock music, sex, drugs and homosexuality.

Figures such as Mariscal, Nazario, Ceesepe, el Hortelano, Ouka Leele, Alberto García Alix or Pedro Almodóvar himself published their first comics and pictures in Star, which also made the most rebellious hard rock or punk groups known, such as Leño, Asfalto or Barón Rojo later on, or those who simply wanted to express themselves in a free and festive way without the constraints of more conventional music, such as Alaska y los Pegamoides, Nacha Pop or Radio Futura.

Many of these artists, who embraced the counterculture to make a place for themselves in a society where they did not feel represented, evolved towards less political or social and more playful positions in an atmosphere of continuous cultural effervescence. This gave shape to what became known as the ‘Movida’, and it was the banner of the modernity of the new democratic Spain in the world.

An interview on the values of craft with the director of the Crafting Cyprus documentary series, fashion critic and curator, Filep Motwary

Resilient and evolving, traditional and forward-facing: crafts tell the stories of the world through objects and techniques, helping us understand where we come from, and where we are heading as a global, inclusive, diverse community.

Crafting Cyprus is one of the many interesting initiatives to reactivate the stories of local craft and present them to an international audience. Crafting Cyprus takes the form of a series of videos written and directed by Filep Motwary, independent fashion curator, author and critic, currently Editor-at-Large of Vogue Greece and Dapper Dan Magazine, in collaboration with the Cyprus Handicraft Service. The series premiered in July 2022 atRévélations International Biennial of Crafts and Creation, and is now touring the world.

To celebrate November as Crafting Heritage month, Filep shares with us his views on crafts - their persistence, their ability to resist time and evolve, while still being true to tradition - and their relationship to the fashion world.

How do you define ‘craft’ within your editorial and curatorial work?

Originality in the making is the most important characteristic of craftsmanship. 
The importance of craft consists of so many parameters. In the lengthy process of object-making by hand, one needs to consider the personal input of the artisan, the knowledge, the emotion, and the time consumed until its finished.

For example, when a couturier sends out a press release, the garments are described in detail from the materials used to the hours it took to make them. The clarification of the process and materials immortalises the object as a case of study for the future. Handicraft, embroidery, and hand-beading were quite present during the first years of my career when I was working as a designer for amaison de couture, while living in Greece. However, my perspective on handicrafts was enriched when I moved to Paris in 2004 and worked for Dior and John Galliano as an intern for both Houses. I started to understand handmade objects in a different way.

Today, within the exhibitions I present to the public as a fashion curator, my aim is to offer the opportunity to spectators of all ages to acknowledge the significance of craft and how it is produced, treaded, and preserved as well as valued and projected.

What is the relationship between crafts and the established fashion system? Are there initiatives you admire that try to connect traditional craft with the system?

Craft may have been devalued with the rise ofprêt à porterin the late 1970s, but not for long.Haute Couture’s great comeback in the mid-1990s was re-established through collections that were designed merely by young designers at the time (Viktor & Rolf, John Galliano, Alexander McQueen). High-end luxury fashion often relies heavily on the concept of expert craftsmanship and this is used to demonstrate quality and expertise, which results in high value and profit. Each of Chanel’sMétiers d'Artshows, for example, honours the fine craftsmanship that its artisan partners bring to the house’s collections.

There are so many wonderful examples of bridging the past with the present. Look at Dries Van Noten and his long-lasting collaboration with Indian craftsmen. Maria Grazia Chiuri is also someone that embraces craft in her work for Dior in many different ways while putting the spotlight on other matters such as feminism and inclusivity.

What fascinates you about the craft of Cyprus? How did you discover them and why did you decide to work on these videos?

My grandparents, from my mother’s side, were farmers. They lived in a humble yet beautiful home, filled with traditional pottery, wood-carved furniture, incredible hand-embroidered tablecloths, pillowcases and sheets, hand-weaved bed covers, and so on. Such treasures! As a young boy that I was, I found all that to be heavy and boring and sometimes ugly even. Going there was always linked to hard work. My memories from back then are filled with strange smells and habits that I couldn’t understand and did not resonate with my daily life in the city.

Up until the age of ten, it was 1987, I would join them every fall to harvest olive trees and again in August for the grapes. I remember my brother and me riding my grandmother’s donkeys, each of them carrying two huge hand-weaved baskets, one on each side, on the bumpy, narrow path to the fields. 34 years later, through an open call, the Cyprus Handicraft Service announced the making of a series of short films that would focus on local crafts.  I shared my proposal immediately in the hope that this new possibility would link with my past and challenge me productively through the angle of a visual storyteller.

With the guidance and great support of Maria Anaxagora, the head of the Cyprus Handicraft Service, we started locating the craftsmen and artists per category while I built the script and the moodboards of the story I wanted to tell. I chose to name this series #craftingcyprus as an ode to the excellency of the work made by hand in Cyprus and how this through punctual artisanship existed for centuries, in the end, it becomes our identity, who we really are as a nation.

Why is it important to preserve craft and - as you did with the videos - tell the stories of different local crafts?

Once you document something that you own and share it with the rest of the world, it becomes official, an establishment.

What did you enjoy the most while working on this project? What do you hope to achieve?

It was truly an emotional journey. I loved the conversations that emerged, and I loved listening to the artisans describing their craft. Many of them continue what their parents did while others devoted their lives to craft by choice. Both kinds are admirable. It's important for me to continue this documentation or similar ones in the future. I feel blessed to have worked with the Cyprus Handicraft Service for something so valuable.

This blog was written as part of theCRAFTED project, which aimed to enrich and promote traditional and contemporary crafts.

Austrian artist Gustav Klimt is lauded as one of the leading lights of the Vienna Secession art movement. His portraits are celebrated for their innovation, style and controversy.

Alongside these portraits, a series of landscapes and floral paintings highlight the role of an Austrian lake in Klimt's inspiration. Visiting over many summers, Klimt painted these paintings around the Attersee lake in Upper Austria - not on commission, simply as he loved the landscapes.

Beginning in the late 1890s, Gustav Klimt visited Attersee each summer. Between 1900 and 1916, he created around 40 of his more than 50 known landscape paintings in this region, and thus created an impressive artistic legacy for Attersee.

He spent eight summers at an inn in Litzlberg, and later moved across the lake to the east bank in 1908 to stay at Villa Oleander for several summers.

This holiday home, built in 1872, belonged to Kammer Castle. Klimt was captivated by painting the building - from 1908 onwards, he portrayed it five times and its adjoining gardens twice.

Klimt's paintings do not often follow the rules of perspective - in his paintings, he moves buildings closer together and flattens the perspective. Distances are cancelled out by his artistic vision and he transforms spaces into surfaces.

Klimt also portrayed landscapes where buildings, flowers and the lake create colourful forms.

Gustav Klimt loved to relax and lose himself in painting the world of plants and flowers. Rather than accurate depictions, the resulting paintings are a playful and sensual mix of colours and shapes.

Near Attersee, Klimt was inspired by fruit trees, blooming meadows and hills and forest of birch, beech and fir trees.

Today, Klimt's Attersee paintings are among his best-known and most expensive paintings. In November 2003, hisLandhaus am Atterseesold for around $29 million andLitzlberg am Atterseewas auctioned for around $40 million in November 2011.

Welker's curious portraits

Ernst Welker's landscape watercolours

Exhibition and book Longing Destination Italy

Welker wanted!

Exploring a curious collection of portraits by a landscape artist

19th century painter Ernst Welker was mostly known as a landscape painter, except for a curious collection of watercolours where he portrayed the salon guests of the Duchess of Courland as humorous mythical creatures. Read this guest blog from Museum Burg Posterstein to discover these extraordinary artworks.

While still studying at the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, the painter Ernst Welker (1784–1857) already received awards for his landscape paintings. He lived from his art for his whole life, exhibiting and selling his works at considerable prices.

With artist friends such as Johann Christoph Erhard, Johann Adam Klein and the brothers Friedrich Philipp Reinhold and Heinrich Reinhold from Gera, he went on art expeditions to Salzburg and Berchtesgaden or in the neighbourhood of Vienna.

Ernst Welker was a volunteer in the Lützow Free Corps during the Napoleonic Wars fighting at the poet Theodor Körner's side and, later, made a drawing of Körner's grave. Wilhelmine, Duchess of Sagan employed him for several years as a drawing teacher and companion for her foster daughters - including Emilie von Binzer who later became a writer.

In the company of the Duchess of Sagan, he stayed on their Silesian estates Żagań and Ratibořice and spent the summer at Löbichau Castle in the salon of the Duchess of Courland, Wilhelmine's mother.

There he produced a series of watercolours, portraying the guests present as mythical creatures, half human, half animal or object. These watercolour pictures are now part of the collection of the Museum Burg Posterstein and can also be seen inEuropeana.

From 1821, Ernst Welker stayed in Italy for several years. One can assume that he moved in the circle of the German-Roman artists' colony and knew well-known artists of his time personally. In the entourage of Wilhelmine, Duchess of Sagan, he travelled to Naples, of which his watercolours bear witness.

And despite all this, Ernst Welker has so far remained largely unnoticed by the art community and scholars.

Until the publication ofItaly, Destination of Desire: The Painter Ernst Welker on Travels and in the Salon of the Duchess of Courland(in German) by the Museum Posterstein Castle, Ernst Welker had never been the main focus of a book, though many art catalogues mention him in passing. Contemporary publications have already made mistakes – for example, his place of birth (Gotha), year of birth (1784), family origin (son of the Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg archivist Philipp Friedrich Welker) and travel destinations of Welker (he was probably never in the near East).

Tracing his life is detective work, which only began with the book published in 2022 - and is far from over.

In 2014, with the support of the Bürgerstiftung Altenburger Land and the Free State of Thuringia, the Museum Posterstein Castle was able to purchase an extraordinary collection of drawings. These portray Löbichauer salon guests as mythical creatures, and were owned by Emilie von Binzer for a long time. The salon of the Duchess of Courland in Löbichau, a few kilometres away from Posterstein, is one of the most important research topics of the Museum Posterstein Castle of Regional History.

The 'Salon guests as mythical creatures' part of the collection consists of 47 watercolours with well-known Löbichau guests and two sketches, all of which were kept in a green half-leather case. They have already been digitised and are freely accessible and usable inEuropeanaand onWikimedia Commons.

Among those portrayed are  the Duchess Anna Dorothea of Courland herself (represented as a loyal poodle) and Welker's employer Wilhelmine, Duchess of Sagan (as a proud steed), as well as the Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg Duke August (as a vain peacock), the writer Elisa von der Recke (as an inkwell), the poet Christoph August Tiedge (as an armchair), the archaeologist Carl August Böttiger (as a statue) and the lawyer Paul Johann Anselm von Feuerbach (as a nail).

Each watercolour is provided with an accompanying rhyme. Emilie von Binzer called these notes under the portraits 'primer verses'. In the 18th century, a primer was understood to be an illustrated learning book with individual motifs that matched the respective letter. Such a primer could have formed the template for Welker's portraits, because there is a letter in upper and lower case in the upper left corner of the picture. In fact, all 26 letters occur, some even more than once. The attempt to cover the entire alphabet also explains verses that sound rather peculiar.

The fact that an art teacher was allowed to take the liberty of such pictures, which were most likely shown in Löbichau, underscores the freedom and openness that prevailed in the salon of the Duchess of Courland. The poet Jean Paul also praised her salon in Löbichau for this very freedom of speech and openness. Incidentally, Ernst Welker drew himself as an oyster with the saying: 'Die Auster ist von guter Art / das groeste an ihr ist der Bart.' ('The oyster is of a good kind, the biggest thing about it is the beard').

The second part of the Welker Collection in Posterstein includes 13 landscape paintings by the painter that the museum owns or that are linked to the museum through permanent loans. Eight watercolours and one oil painting show landscapes. With the exception of one sheet, all works are signed with Welker; E. Welker; E.W.; withered fec.; E. Welker fec.; and Ernst Welker fec.

The small collection is supplemented by works by Johann Christoph Erhard, Johann Adam Klein, Johann Christian Reinhart and Carl Trost.

The collection largely comes from the collector Uwe Buchheim. Impressed by the research and exhibitions on the salon of the Duchess of Courland, through which he began to study the painter Ernst Welker. Not only did he work to ensure that the portrait collection of the salon guests could be acquired by the museum in 2014, he has been collecting himself ever since and has made the acquired works available to the museum.

The special exhibition and the book of the same name,Longing Destination Italy - The Painter Ernst Welker Traveling and in the Salon of the Duchess of Courlandshow all of these Welker works for the first time. The book traces the life of the painter based on the museum's collections and research.

While working on it, we came across new information and other works by Welker in various international collections. We are particularly pleased that for the first time we have been able to process a part of the Biron Collection of the Thuringian University and State Library in Jena that had not yet been indexed. These include salon scenes, portraits and sketches for the Posterstein collection of salon guest portraits.

Important sources were also opened up by looking at the digital archive of theThorvaldsens Museumin Copenhagen. Furthermore we received illustrations for the book from theAlbertina Vienna, theGera Art Collection, the Art Collection'Hamburger Kunsthalle', theDresden Art Collections, theLindenau Museum in Altenburg, theGerman Literature Archivein Marbach, theNuremberg Municipal Museums, theAustrian National Library, theThuringian University and State Library, theSaxon State and University Library, theThorvaldsens Museum Copenhagen, theBritish Museumand theWeimar Classic Foundation.

In the book, we compare Welker's works with illustrations of works by his fellow painters. Since Welker - apart from his drawings - left hardly any written sources himself, there are definitely gaps in the biography.

We would therefore like to call for the collection and exchange of research data on the painter Ernst Welker. We are very grateful for any information. On our website,salon-europa.eu, we would like to provide an overview of various stations in Welker's life and of the holdings of the collection worldwide and maintain it long term.

After the exhibition, we plan to add all new information to the Wikipedia page on Ernst Welker.

The exhibition Longing for Italy – the painter Ernst Welker on his travels and in the salon of the Duchess of Courland is on display at Museum Burg Posterstein from July 17 to November 13 2022.

Public art in European locations by the British sculptor

Henry Moore was a British artist, who lived from 1898 to 1986. He was a prolific sculptor and drawer, producing many artworks throughout a long career that spanned many decades.

Born in Yorkshire, Moore trained in Leeds and London, and later lived in London and Hertfordshire. By the late 1940s, Moore was a worldwide celebrity, considered to be one of the most prominent British modern artists. By the end of his career, Moore was the world's most successful living artist at auction with his sculptures selling for millions.

Moore's sculptures are largely abstract depictions of human figures, often suggesting female and family forms.

Many of Henry Moore's sculptures, drawings and other works are now part of the collections of museums and galleries around the world.

In addition to these collections, many of his artworks are found around Europe and the world, located in public spaces for all to enjoy and appreciate.

Let's take a virtual tour around Europe to discover highlights of Henry Moore's sculptures across the continent.

Moore's sculpture 'King and queen' (Koning en Koningin) is found in the collection of Middelheim, a 30-hectare sculpture park in Antwerp. The park was established in 1951, with the artwork dating from 1952-53.

A memorial sculpture to Irish poet and author William Butler Yeats by Henry Moore is found in the St Stephen's Green park in Dublin. It was unveiled in October 1967, located in the park which was one of Yeats's favourite Dublin locations.

Slottstorget is a public open space in Gävle, a city in northern Sweden. There, Henry Moore's 'Three Piece Reclining Figure' has been on display since 1976 when it was donated to the municipality.

As Henry Moore lived in London for many years, it should be no surprise that the UK capital city has several sculptures by him on display.

The sculpture 'Locking Piece' has been on display on Millbank since the 1970s. It is located near to Chelsea School of Art (now known as Chelsea College of Arts) where Moore worked as the head of the sculpture department. It is also near theTate Gallery(now known as Tate Britain) which holds a significant collection of Moore's artworks.

The Brandon Estate is a social housing estate in Kennington, south London, built in the late 1950s. The Henry Moore sculpture 'Two Piece Reclining Figure No.3 1961' was installed there in the 1960s, under a scheme to place artworks in post-war estates known as 'The Abercrombie Plan'.

Finally in London, the Victoria & Albert Museum - the world's largest museum for applied arts, decorative arts, and design - holds a collection of clothing and textiles with patterns designed by Henry Moore. Though neither sculpture nor public art, this collection is a testiment to Moore's adaptable creativity.

In 1955, Henry Moore designed a relief for the facade of a building in Rotterdam. This piece is unique among Moore's artworks, as his only piece made from bricks. It took two master bricklayers four months to complete. Since the early 2010s, the artwork has been placed on a new building on the street Weena.

Since 1970, a large bronze sculpture 'Reclining Figure' has been on prominent display in the plaza outside the Tel Aviv Museum.

Additionally, the Israel Museum in Jerusalem holds a collection of works by Henry Moore.

Karlplatz is a large square in the Austrian capital city Vienna, located on the border between the city's first and fourth districts. A Henry Moore sculpture - 'Hill Arches 1973' - is found in a fountain in the square in front of the Karlskirche church. It was installed in 1978.

From 1966 to 1997, a Moore sculpture 'Draped Seated Woman' was on display in the forecourt of the theatre Schauspielhaus in Wuppertal, a city in the west of Germany, as captured in the photograph below. The theatre closed in 2013 and, since then, the sculpture has been displayed in a sculpture park and outside a swimming pool complex in the city.

Audre Lorde in Berlin

The ‘master's’ street signs

Exploring the author's salient legacy

"The master's tools will never dismantle the master's house". This statement by Audre Lorde is still as elegant, radical and relevant today as it was in the late 1970s. When marginalised groups pay heed to Lorde's message and forge their own utensils, they can bring about a lot of positive change. Eventually, they even get to dismantle the master's street signs.

Audre Lorde was an exceptional African-American writer, professor and feminist activist – who would famously refer to herself as 'black, lesbian, mother, warrior, poet.' Lorde's life and work is well documented in encyclopaedias, books and academic papers.This blog takes a closer look at how Audre Lorde impacted German society, and how she is connected to a substantial number of items in this database of European culture.

Lorde was born and raised in the United States where she also spent the better part of her adult life. She first came to Germany in 1984, at the age of 50. Back then, she was a visiting scholar to the Free University of Berlin, invited by German sociologist Dagmar Schultz. Lorde made a lot of friends, inspired a lot of people – first and foremost, but not exclusively: black women – and kept coming back to the city on a regular basis until 1992. Schultz later on made a documentary on this era:Audre Lorde - The Berlin Years.

It is remarkable to see what the charismatic writer and activist achieved in relatively short time. She only stayed a couple of months, and in 1985 she did not visit at all. To begin with, she coined the term 'Afro-Germans' or ; Afro-Deutsche', which is now a widely known and accepted word for people of Sub-Saharan African descent who are citizens of or live in Germany.

Afro-german, Deutsche Welle, In copyright

Lorde also inspired the foundation of ADEFRA (Afrodeutsche Frauen = Afro-German Women), the first grassroots activist group of its kind, formed by black feminists and lesbians (Jasmin Eding, Judy Gummich, Elke Jank, Katja Kinder, Katharina Oguntoye, Daniela Tourkazi, Eva von Pirch, and others) in Berlin in 1986. The organisation is active and influential up to the present day.

An early literary landmark that emerged from the ADEFRA sphere was the non-fiction bookFarbe bekennen('Showing your colours'), written by May Ayim and Katharina Oguntoye, with Dagmar Schultz taking on the role of the publisher. It is not surprising at this point that Audre Lorde not only inspired the book, but also provided a foreword: 'This the first joint attempt by Afro-German women to share the reality of their lives with white Germans and others'. Of course, this reality was dramatically shaped by sexism, racism, 'otherness' and Germany's colonial past.

During her time in Berlin, Audre Lorde became a mentor to May Ayim and also to other pioneering Afro-German writers and activists, like Helga Emde or Ika Hügel-Marshall. She thus helped foster an entire scene of black/female/queer academics, artists and activists who had little visibility before.

A fascinating aspect of Lorde's own activism was the fact that even though she identified as black and lesbian, she would frequently reach out to white, heterosexual women, as she considered intersectionality an avenue into a better, diverse, and inclusive future.

The influence of Lorde's literary and academic writing in Germany and Europe is hard to measure, but it is safe to say that everyone who is concerned with the history of feminist/black/queer activism and emancipation is likely to mention her name at some point.

Take for instance 'Queer-Feminist Punk – An Anti-Social History' by Vienna-based scholar Katharina Wiedlack. The book, which came out in 2015 andis available for free via Europeana, is full of references to the late, great Audre Lorde.

Let us not get lost in details, though. Let us rather come back to the quote at the beginning, the fight against colonial ideology, and the publicly visible legacy of Audre Lorde and her friends in Berlin.

A rather big day for female Afro-Germans, women of colour in general, and progressive citizens of Berlin came in 2011 when – after a lot of debate and petitioning – a prominent riverside road in Kreuzberg was finally renamed  May-Ayim-Ufer, in remembrance of the Ghanaian-German writer and companion of Audre Lorde. Before that, it had been called Gröbenufer for more than 100 years – after Otto Friedrich von der Groeben, a Prussian colonialist and facilitator of the Transatlantic slave trade.

Very recently, in 2021, the district of Kreuzberg, Berlin, decided there should also be a street dedicated to Audre Lorde herself, once again replacing an anachronic name giver of questionable reputation. The Northern part of Manteuffelstraße, which connects two Kreuzberg main streets and used to honour the highly conservative, antidemocratic Prussian politician Otto Theodor von Manteuffel, will soon be adorned by street signs remembering the black, feminist writer.

In 2022, Afro-German feminist thought is more visible than ever (a new generation of writers like Alice Hasters or Sharon Dodua Otoo is actually making a big splash), topics like structural racism and sexism are frequently debated in mainstream media – and new initiatives to dismantle the master's street signs are underway.

While this development is owed to many progressive voices and a collective effort, the impact of Audre Lorde and her work in Berlin can hardly be underestimated.

The myth

The legacy

Saint Maurice is the patron saint of the Holy Roman Empire, has a statue in the Vatican and is depicted in many churches, most notably across Germany. But little is known about the saint, most probably because he might have never actually lived.

There is no historical consensus about the veracity of Saint Maurice's life and martyrdom. Some historians point to Saint Maurice being a pure fabrication of Medieval Christian beliefs, some claim that he really lived but his legacy has been altered throughout the ages.

So who is Saint Maurice? What did he do to become a saint and how did his image become the first artistic depiction of Black people in Europe?

Saint Maurice is said to have led a Theban Legion of Christian Roman soldiers in the 3rd Century AD. The Roman emperor Maximian commanded Maurice's legion to march to Agaunum. Today, Agaunum is named after Saint Maurice, you'll find it on the map as St-Maurice en Valais in Switzerland. The Emperor had given the soldiers instructions that Maurice, an avowed Christian, could not follow in good faith.

What exactly the Emperor had ordered is unclear: he might have told the legion to give offerings to pagan gods, or he might have asked the legion to harass or kill local Christian townsfolk. Maurice pleaded with his legion not to follow the Emperor's orders. The legion sided with Maurice and refused to act out Maximian's bidding.

As punishment, Maximian ordered the legion to be decimated: as the etymology of the word 'decimated' (from the Latin 'decimatus': destroying one in ten), this meant that for every ten soldiers, one was to be executed.

This did not scare the Thebean Legion, who continued to refuse orders, suffering a second decimation as punishment from the emperor. Bolstered by Maurice's resolve, the Thebean legion still did not budge on their stance - Maximian ordered the entire Legion to be killed. So Maurice was martyred.

The veracity of this myth is hard to verify. The earliest accounts of this event only appeared 150 years after the fact, when the Church declared Maurice a saint for his martyrdom by the hand of Maximian.

Since it's not even sure if Saint Maurice was a real historical figure or just a myth, it's almost impossible to speculate on what Saint Maurice would have even looked like, if he did exist.

Until the 13th century, Saint Maurice was always depicted as a white man in soldier's outfit.

In Magdeburg, in Germany, an abbey dedicated to Saint Maurice (Sankt Moritz) was erected in 937, and was expanded to a Cathedral in 955. The cathedral was completely destroyed in 1207 by a city-wide fire. During its reconstruction, a new statue in honour of Saint Maurice was placed in the cathedral, made by an unknown artist. This artist chose to depict Saint Maurice with black skin.

The reason for depicting Saint Maurice in this way is unclear. The artist might have interpreted Saint Maurice's background as a soldier of Thebes, in northern Egypt, as an indication that Maurice must have been Black. What is sure is that with this change, for the first time a Black African was being depicted in Medieval European art.

Depicting Saint Maurice as a person of colour did not stop at the statue in Magdeburg. More churches throughout Germany, Switzerland, France and Italy started showing Saint Maurice as a Black man in their statues, paintings and manuscripts. This trend did not spread throughout all of Europe: other churches in other countries continued to visualise Saint Maurice as white.

Statues, paintings, reliefs and other depictions of Saint Maurice still stand in many churches, abbeys and cathedrals in Eastern Germany. Even though his appearance and past are contested, he remains an important piece of Black iconography in Europe.

Explore some of the mixed-race royals of European history.

In examining the royal families of Europe, one discovers the presence of not only Black people, but also mixed-race people, both of whom have contributed to the history of Europe.

One such mixed-race person is the well-known Queen Charlotte of England and Ireland, who married King George III in the 18th century.

Charlotte’s ancestors were from Mecklenburg-Strelitz in Germany. Her ancestry is said to be German as well as from the Black branch of the Portuguese royal family, namely Alfonso III and his Moorish mistress.

Despite the fact their marriage was arranged, they nevertheless experienced a deep and loving relationship. They especially shared a love of music and the arts.

However, Charlotte did face discrimination because of her race. She was at times described as ugly because of her prominent ‘mulatto’ features. And yet, as can be seen by the paintings of the queen, these remarks were influenced by racist views regarding what constituted beauty.

On the other hand, some historians have claimed there is a question about her African ancestry despite strong evidence to the contrary.

It is still the subject of a continuing debate, especially because of the implications it suggests. For example, her lineage would mean that her granddaughter, Queen Victoria, would have had black heritage and that Victoria’s future descendants would have as well.

It seems obvious that issues of race continue to plague discussions about not only Queen Charlotte, but also under what circumstances future persons could be legitimate heirs to the thrones in wider Europe.

Charlotte was an intelligent woman who despite her ‘looks' achieved notoriety for her positions on politics, especially her anti-slavery stance and her musical talents. She bore 15 children; 13 survived into adulthood. She is even well known in America as a city in the state of North Carolina is named after her.

Interestingly, there is evidence that Queen Charlotte may not have been recognised as the first mixed race queen of England.

Queen Philippa of Hainault, who was born in 1310 in Valenciennes in France had Black Moorish ancestry. She married Edward of York, who just before their marriage in 1328, became King Edward III of England. She became queen some two years after her husband’s ascension to the throne in 1330.

Unlike Charlotte, she was not subject to the unfounded criticisms regarding her race and physical appearance. She was instead described according to the medieval writer, Joshua Barnes, as, ‘a very good and charming person who exceeded most ladies for the sweetness of nature and virtuous disposition’.

It is ostensible that mixed-race royals and monarchs were present in both past and present moments in European history.

Despite attempts to erase them from the chronologies of history, painters, writers of literature (i.e. Eschenbach’s Parzival) and progressive historians have made mixed-race royals visible and important characters in the overall story of Europe.

Today we see also mixed-race royal couples such asPrincess AngelaandPrince Maximillian of Liechtenstein, Prince Harry andMeghan, Duchess of Sussex, and Countess Mary and Ferdinand Leopold Joseph Count von Habsburg of Austria not as anomalies to the normative expectations for what constitutes a ‘proper’ royal union, but rather as persons who have made a commitment to one another.

Therefore, in recognising and accepting the humanity and dignity of all people, we can share a triumphant story of mixed-race people ever contributing to the long and rich history of Europe.

Highlights

Exploring the history of Black Gospel music in Museum Catharijneconvent

Black Gospel music is the subject of a new exhibition at Museum Catharijneconvent in Utrecht, the Netherlands, introduced in this blog by Willem Driebergen.

Early on a Sunday morning in December 2012, my wife and I got into our rental car and headed out from Little Rock, Arkansas to Memphis, Tennessee. Memphis is the city of Elvis and his Graceland, of blues, soul and rock'n'roll, of the mighty Mississippi, and also of 'The Full Gospel Tabernacle': the church of soul legend and Reverend Al Green!

Once we arrived at the small church, in the middle of the greenery, we walked in together with the locals, all in their most beautiful Sunday clothes. We sat down in the back row somewhat timidly and, before we knew it, he was there: the Reverend Al Green.

What followed was an unforgettable gospel experience and the highlight of our musical tour through the southern United States. Now, ten years later, I am proud that as a music lover and collector, I can helpMuseum Catharijneconventwith the search for and implementation of  gospel video, audio and photo material for the exhibitionGospel, a musical journey of spirit and hope.

A subject such as gospel naturally lends itself well to a rich multimedia visitor experience with beautiful striking images and inspiring music. This is a new kind of experience for Museum Catharijneconvent, which is the national Dutch museum for the art, culture and history of Christianity, and a different way to collect material.

Although there is a lot of material on YouTube, it is often difficult to determine who the rightful owners of these images are. This makes the platform useful as a research starting point, but for better material we have to look further.

A handy source of information isdelpher.nl, the digital platform with millions of digitised texts from Dutch newspapers, books and magazines, all of which can be searched online. Here I soon came across a number of early gospel concerts in the Netherlands that were also broadcast on Dutch television or radio. With this information I went to the archives ofBeeld & Geluid (the Netherlands Institute for Sound & Vision), the Dutch national institute for media culture in the Netherlands and one of the largest audiovisual collections in Europe. The majority of the video material in our exhibition comes from these archives.

Through Europeana, I came acrossInstitut national de l'audiovisuel(or INA.fr).

Over the years, French television has recorded many jazz festivals. The archive of INA is therefore a great source for our exhibition. We have also received material from, among others, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and museums and archives in the United States, including the archives of Fisk University in Nashville, home of the Fisk Jubilee Singers, who are so important to the history of gospel.

The exhibition is packed with gospel gems but I would like to share a short personal top 3 from the exhibition:

Mahalia Jackson at Palaver'64

The queen of gospel, Mahalia Jackson first came to the Netherlands in April 1961 for a legendary performance in the Amsterdam Concertgebouw. In 1964, she came back to the Netherlands to perform at Palaver'64.

This youth manifestation, held on Ascension Day 1964 in the Irenehal in Utrecht, was held on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the Dutch Bible Society. Under the motto 'een miljoen voor Kameroen' ('one million for Cameroon'), money was raised to send bibles to Cameroon.

23,000 young people were present, welcoming Mahalia with a standing ovation and breathless listening alternated with enthusiastic clapping hands for an hour.

During the performance, the police officers in the hall found it increasingly difficult to restrain the young people, who wanted to get as close to the stage as possible. When Mahalia playedOh When the Saintstowards the end, there was no stopping it. In front of the stage, next to the stage and soon also on stage, the young people crowded together. Seven police officers struggled to save a small space for Mahalia Jackson. Even the officers clapped enthusiastically along with the crowd from time to time. A fragment of this special performance in Utrecht can be seen in ourexhibition.

Amazing Grace by Aretha Franklin

In January 1972, Aretha Franklin, the Queen of Soul, recorded the double LPAmazing Graceat the New Temple Missionary Baptist Church in Los Angeles, accompanied by her musical mentor Reverend James Cleveland and his Southern California Community Choir.

For this record, Aretha received a Grammy Award for Best Soul Gospel Performance in 1973. It is Aretha's best selling album and also the best-selling live gospel album of all time.

Although the recordings were also filmed at the time, due to technical difficulties, it was not until 2018 that 'Amazing Grace' was also released as a film. We are delighted and proud that we can show, hear and above all experience the complete 11-minute performance of the song 'Amazing Grace' from the film in the exhibition.

Rosetta Tharpe backstage at the Jazz à Juan Festival

Singer and guitarist Sister Rosetta Tharpe is also known as the Godmother of rock and roll. Rosetta began touring churches in the southern states of America with her mother in 1921 at the age of six, billed as a 'singing and guitar playing miracle'.

Sister Rosetta brought gospel from churches to concert venues and nightclubs.

Her music influenced rock'n'roll musicians such as Little Richard, Chuck Berry and Elvis Presley. In particular, her tour of the United Kingdom with Muddy Waters in 1964 has been identified by English blues guitarists such as Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck and Keith Richards as a milestone for the blues in England.

In the Institut national de l'audiovisuel, I found a beautiful video of Rosetta, backstage at the Jazz à Juan Festival in Juan-les-Pins, Antibes, France.

During an interview, Rosetta can't help but play little licks on her guitar and when the interview ends she plays the gospel classicHis Eye Is On The Sparrowaccompanying herself on her guitar. This intimate performance feels as if she is playing it especially for you and you can experience it yourself in the exhibition.

You can explore the history of gospel in visual and song until 10 April 2023 at theMuseum Catharijneconventin Utrecht. If you can't wait or cannot visit, here's a playlist with a small selection of my favourite gospel songs.

Always there, forever lost?

Eternal allegiance

From Plumstead to Ashburton Grove

As the interest in intangible heritage is increasing, galleries, libraries, museums and other collection holders are currently investigating which (and how) tangible artefacts can represent traditions, practices, skills and cultural phenomena.

Looking at photographic collections in particular, it's a striking realisation that physical prints or negatives are tangible representations of immaterial narratives, while the depictions, the images themselves, are recordings of moments that carry an essence of tangibility. Ironically, the digital transfer of an image re-renders the tangible carrier into an intangible asset that takes on new life and meaning in the even less material 'cloud'.

Talking about and working with intangible cultural heritage is a challenging and complex process, as the partners in dedicated efforts - such as theWEAVE project- can testify first-hand.

Editing through their extensive press photo collections, the team atTopFoto- an image agency based in Edenbridge, England - was triggered by the complexity of the topic to explore an analogy with a famous philosophical problem:  the'Ship of Theseus'-paradox.

In ancient Greek mythology,Theseuswas the founder-king of Athens, mostly famous for slaying the minotaur and loving - then betraying - Ariadne, daughter of King Minos. In being a 'mythical king', Theseus instantly provokes a level of intangible heritage; but there is much more to it.

The 'Ship of Theseus'-paradox was first narrated byPlutarch, a historian and early biographer of Theseus. In the hero’s life story, Plutarch’sparagraphabout the ship runs as follows:

The ship wherein Theseus and the youth of Athens returned from Crete had thirty oars, and was preserved by the Athenians down even to the time of Demetrius Phalereus, for they took away the old planks as they decayed, putting in new and stronger timber in their places, insomuch that this ship became a standing example among philosophers, for the logical question of things that grow; one side contending that the ship remained the same, the other that it did not.

In other words: if the ship of Theseus was kept in a harbour and every part of it got replaced piece by piece, would it then be a new ship or still the same? If it is a new ship, at what point did it stop being the ship of Theseus? And - as philosopherThomas Hobbeslater asked - if all the removed pieces would be reassembled to form a new ship, would that ship be the ship of Theseus too?

Now how does this relate to intangible heritage?

A good example to illustrate this is the domain of sport. Traditionally, people identify with their local team (I live here, my team is…), often their national equipe as well. Territorial borders - it should be said - are great examples of intangible heritage too, as the majority of the world does not have a painted line on the ground or anything as tangible as a checkpoint or a wall.

Anyway: as intangible as they might be, borders could very well be decisive for your allegiance to wearing red or blue on a Saturday afternoon. Of course, the world is more complicated than that, and particularly in contemporary society the global 'us and them' has blurred. Nonetheless, your club loyalty might very well be  'inherited' from the place, the community or the family you stem from.

But what happens when you move house, far away from your revered grounds - will your fanship change or remain the same? Or, vice versa: what happens if your team, its trainer, their very position in the community changes? Will team spirit be the same or take on a new identity?

For example, we can take a look at the history of one famous English football club, Arsenal.

Founded in 1886, it was formed by Royal Arsenal munitions workers in Woolwich, south of the river Thames. Their original ground, located in nearby Plumstead, was destroyed by suffragettes in 1913. The club then moved north of the river to the famous Arsenal Stadium in Highbury, where it played its home games for almost 100 years.

Denied permission to expand the ground, it relocated to a purpose built stadium on a former waste site, in Ashburton Grove in 2006.

A familiar tale for many a hallowed turf of clubs all around the world. Considering that each individual blade of grass lives around 40 to 50 days, even the ones that stand still have little claim on permanency. Unless we embrace the intangible heritage adagium that states that the 're-skinned' ship of Theseus is indeed the same as Theseus' ship, and therefore the club Arsenal is the club Arsenal, whether it be housed in Highbury or Ashburton Grove.

The memories, the passion, the joy, the togetherness, the celebration of goals, the frustration of losing are all embodied in a collective spirit which is constantly changing and forever remaining the same. Wherever the paradox of Theseus' ship applies, intangible heritage shines through.

This blog is part ofWEAVE – Widen European Access to cultural communities Via Europeana, a project aimed at developing a framework to link the tangible and intangible heritage of cultural communities.

Statues depicting the Virgin Mary

If you were born in Catalonia and raised Catholic, you probably adore ‘la Moreneta’ (the Black Virgin of Montserrat). Jointly with Sant Jordi (Saint George), she is the patron of Catalonia and historically represented the national spirit of this land and the values of resistance and strength attached to the Catalan identity.

When I was a child my parents organised an annual day trip to Montserrat (‘serrated mountain’ in Catalan), the site of theSanta Maria de MontserratAbbey, which hoststhe Virgin of Montserratsanctuary. I loved it, I couldn’t wait for the moment to happen each year.

This mountain is magical with its bizarre shape, breathtaking views, adventurous trails and all the historical narratives and legends around it. In my memories it will always be connected to my favourite family bonding time, a day we gave to us to walk together and get tired, to talk, to play, to kiss and hug, to laugh and of course to see our Black Virgin and pray to her, once again, to take care of us. As a white child in a predominantly white world, I always thought that she was unique.

But ‘la Moreneta’ wasn’t unique: according to some scholars, at one time, it could even have been the most common depiction of the Holy Virgin. She is one of the approximately 500 Black Madonna statues in Europe, many of them found in France, Italy, Germany and Spain. They’ve been also found in other parts of the world like South America or the Philippines, probably due to their colonial past.

The overall number could have been much higher but some were destroyed during wars, disappeared or are currently in private collections. They’ve also beenlightened or repainted.

Remaining statues can be found in churches or sacred and religious places like Montserrat, ideal for pilgrims and processions.

La quarta incoronazione centenaria della Madonna di Oropa. 29 Agosto 1920fromCineteca MNC

Many of these processions in Europe happen in summer on 15 August, the feast of the Assumption of Mary, which is  a public holiday in many countries with a Catholic or Orthodox background.

The Black Madonna figure is mostly found in Byzantine-style sculpture and paintings. The statues are up to 75cm high, sometimes made of stone but mostly made from painted wood. Some were produced in Italy between the 13th and 14th centuries but they are even older.

Over the last century, the common explanation for their black colour was that they darkened over time due to age, smoke, and grime. This is exactly what my parents were told and how it was explained by school nuns.

Recent research shows that the Black Madonna phenomenon has been highly misunderstood by mainstream Christianity because of racism and ignorance. The misleading true origins resulted in many cases in the whitening of some of the sculptures or removing the child from the mother figure to be replaced by a lighter little Jesus.

According toEan Begg and other scholars, the devotion to Mary developed from Templars and Cathars who projected on her  a divine femininity and the perception of women as compassionate and intelligent, beyond mothers and wives. Black Madonnas are frequently found in Templar cathedrals and churches, as they were responsible for bringing statues and paintings back from the Crusades to Western Europe.

These new studies and hypotheses suspect that the Catholic Church has neglected the origins of the Black Madonna because she represents the pre-Christian goddesses and the African folk religions associated with the earth and fertility. The Mother Goddess or Mother Earth is supposed to be the creator of humankind who nurtures and protects, who has power and wisdom. Some examples are Kali in India and Isis in Egypt. These goddesses usually have a crown, are seated on a throne and hold a child on their lap. Sounds familiar?

More contemporary studies show how African beliefs and mysticism influenced the dominant religions of Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism, but this has been underacknowledged and over-shadowed. Black Madonnas were depicted as more powerful and strong than the virginity, obedience and submissive ideal embodied by white statues of the Virgin Mary. Thus, by neglecting Black Madonna figures and conveying the Virgin Mary as white, Catholic doctrine has helped to perpetuate gender inequalities and consolidate a white male patriarchy for centuries.

Now, as an adult and mother of a daughter, open to new multiperspective historical narratives, free from religious constraints and able to give sense to a more plausible origin of our Black Catalan Virgin, I love ‘la Moreneta’ more than ever, and the family memories attached to her.

Exploring visual and political narratives

The Spanish Civil War ran between 1936 and 1939, and was fought between Republican and Nationalist forces. It saw the end of the Second Spanish Republic and the establishment of the fascist dictatorship under general Francisco Franco’s Spanish State, a highly repressive state that remained until his death in 1975. In this blog, we will be looking at how posters reflected the events of the war and help us understand the narratives of the parties.

Elections in 1931 saw a landslide victory for left-wing republican parties. Two days after the elections, King Alfonso XIII left the country. During the following years, political tensions would rise dramatically and eventually culminate in a coup staged by monarchic-traditionalist military forces in Ceuta and Melilla against the republican government and quickly spread throughout the country. Consequently, the war was fought in many major Spanish cities as well as North-west Africa.

The Spanish Civil War was marked by bloody atrocities and massacres. The two belligerents, the Republicans and the Nationalists, were both composed of multiple and quite diverging political groups that were only loosely held together. Often, their only shared common ground was a common enemy.

Throughout the war, both sides made extensive use of propaganda. One of the most visually striking displays were the many posters that were published during the war demonstrating both side's narratives. Often, these narratives were founded on the same basic goals or fears, like concerns about security and the future of Spain. Another example is combating illiteracy.

One reason the heavy use of propaganda posters was so effective and widespread, was the fact that, in the 1930s, many people from different regions of the country could not read or write. Striking and colourful posters with a clear and distinct message were thus an effective way of communication for propaganda.

Posters include various examples from both the Republicans and Nationalists, covering a range of topics that were of high importance for both sides, like: depictions of the enemy, freedom, youth.

They regularly make use of recurring elements such as youthful and strong soldiers or children in danger, and murder committed by the enemy side.

The poster below depicts an actual photograph of a dead child. This strong imagery is both effective in provoking an emotional responses, and highly controversial. (A fact that holds true to this day, as evidenced by the publication of the photograph of a dead child refugee in 2015.)

Posters often depict the enemy as greedy, avaricious, semi-human monsters. Often, the same imagery and elements are used to convey a narrative of the enemy's untrustworthiness and guilt. The poster below depicts 'hoarders' as enemies of the war effort that should be 'treated as they deserve'.

The poster below calls for the extermination of 'leftists'. As the Republic had used all of Spain's gold reserves to buy Soviet weapons and the fact that many communists and other far-left leaning groups were fighting on the side of the Republicans, this was a popular target for the Nationalist propaganda.

The war led to many refugees seeking shelter in other countries. Around half a million people sought shelter elsewhere, mostly in France.

As seen in this poster below, refugees also sparked controversies and their presence was used for propaganda. The poster reads that: 'The best hotels are residences for refugee children.'

Chilean poet and diplomat Pablo Neruda organised the immigration of 2,200 Republican exiles to Chile from France. Neruda was not the only famous writer who was actively involved in writing or even fighting in the Spanish Civil war. Other notable names include George Orwell, who fought in the Republican Militia, Emma Goldman, Federico Garci Lorca, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry and Ernest Hemingway.

These posters were among the various tools and visual elements that both sides of the conflict used for their propaganda, which was an important weapon of the war. The posters can now serve as highly valuable and insightful sources to learn about the use and spread, and above all the aims of war propaganda.

After Franco’s death in 1975, Spain released a number of amnesties in order to ensure a peaceful transition from the dictatorship to a democracy. Today, new narratives of the Civil War in the twenty-first century have formed in their own right.

This blog was inspired by a Source Collection on Historiana, which offers free historical content, ready to use learning activities, and innovative digital tools made by and for history educators across Europe. The source collection includes 25 of propaganda posters, available on Europeana as part of the collection of the Goldfarb Library, Brandeis University.

The main image above is a composite of two posters:'C.N.T. 19 julio 1936'and 'Els estranguladors del poble espanyol'.

Breaking news

It's harvest time!

From vine to wine

Podravska wine region

Drink a little wine… you’ll feel better

How TV Slovenia has portrayed autumn grape harvests, wine production, and wine culture on Slovenian television

From its very beginnings, television has been a mass communication medium for breaking news about politics and economics, national and international events, and for sharing cultural and sporting achievements.
But public service broadcasters are also, by law, obliged to notify the public of important local events from all the regions of the country. Considering that there are more than ten regions in Slovenia, it seems reasonable to acknowledge that public service television could never cover every event from every region equally, so some Slovenians will always feel deprived of news they consider important.
This doesn’t seem to be the case, though, when it comes to reporting autumn grape harvesting in Slovenia. As the harvest differs from region to region, happening from late summer to late autumn, there seems to be a steady flow of reports covering the grape harvest in our archives. Is this just a coincidence, or might national pride about Slovenia’s wine industry have something to do with this? Let’s find out.

In early autumn, vast vineyards are laden with sweet grapes that glisten in the autumn sun and invite hardworking hands to pick their tender fruit. In general, August, September, and October are the prime time of the annual grape harvest for most winegrowers, but the final decision on when it’s time for harvest comes down to weather conditions and the grapes' ripeness. When the moment comes, an invitation to “Come, come to harvest!” –  this is the traditional call for the grape harvest – echoes through vineyards all over Slovenia.

Since the earliest times, grape harvests have been social events. When the grapes are ripe enough and contain the right quantity of sugar, the whole family shows up, along with those who come to help them pick the sweet grapes. Harvest shears are distributed and grape picking begins. Often an accordion player is nearby, making the work and gathering even more enjoyable. Let’s listen to one from the grape harvest in Bizeljsko from 1995.

No accordion is playing in the next clip, as there is only a silent version available in our archives, but one can imagine the same joyful atmosphere at the end of September 1963, during a grape harvest in the modern terraced vineyards of Brda Agricultural Cooperative. All these vineyards are arranged on wire support and high cultivation. We might easily imagine this black and white clip in modern colour, and be looking at the grape harvest of today. Look at the cheerful faces of the girls and their thin fingers that run from cluster to cluster to fill the barrel with grapes. Full barrels are then taken by strong men and shaken in special-type tubs loaded on tractor-trailers. These tubs allow for hasty manipulation later during pickup. From morning to evening, tractors drive towards Dobrovo cellar where this precious fruit is pressed into a sweet must. It is very important that harvested grapes are sent safely and quickly for processing.

The origins of wine production in Slovenia stretch back to Roman times. Some even claim that winemaking in Slovenia existed long before the Romans introduced winemaking to France, Germany, and Spain – that it dates back to the time of the Celts and Illyrian tribes. It's no wonder then that Slovenia has such a rich winemaking history and more than 30,000 winegrowers and wineries, producing more than 80 million litres of wine annually from its 18,550 hectares of vineyards.1

Slovenia has nine wine districts and three wine regions. Each region has its way of flavouring wine with its soil composition, climate, and wine-growing tradition. Whether you prefer white or red, full-bodied or light, dry or sweet, you can be sure of finding your favourite wine in one of the three wine-growing regions of Slovenia. With about twenty wine routes to follow, one is bound to find a drop or two to stimulate his or her appetite.

Let’s take a look at three wine regions and see some TV broadcasts covering different aspects of the grape harvest, wine growing, or wine production from different periods.

The Podravska wine region in the northeast of Slovenia is the largest and it is divided into two wine districts: Štajerska Slovenija and Prekmurje. The region is synonymous with white wine and is most known for producing some world-class dessert wines, including ice wines as well as Slovenia’s first sparkling wines. Elegant aromatic white varietals shine here, well-suited to the miner-rich soils and more continental climate. The climate is characterised by modest temperature differences between day and night, relatively dry summers, and fairly harsh winters which gives the wine its predominantly floral and fruity aromas and better drinkability. The best-known varieties are Blaufränkisch wines, Sauvignon blanc, Rheinriesling, Pinot Gris, Gelber Muskateller, Traminer, and Chardonnay.

The following black and white silent clip is from Jeruzalem. The wine-growing country of the Ljutomer-Ormož Hills in Štajerska Slovenia has always offered ideal conditions to produce white wines. But the best vineyards in the region are located on the hills that surround the village of Jeruzalem – the jewel of the region. This is where some of the best wines are born. The clip from 1959 depicts the grape harvest from the very beginning with the arrival of the grape pickers till the very end when the sweet must is pressed.

But it is not in this picturesque landscape where one would find the oldest vine. The oldest vine in the world resides in Maribor, right at the centre of the old town, where it has been growing for over 400 years. It’s winding its way up the front of the building at 8 Vojašniška street, now a museum Hiša stare trte. The museum is dedicated to teaching visitors all there is to know about the wine culture of the Štajerska Slovenia wine district. The Old Vine, with an age that spans over 400 years, won its place in the Guinness World Records by being the oldest noble vine in the world still bearing grapes.

Posavska wine region is the smallest of the wine-producing regions in Slovenia. It is a less densely planted region and has not yet developed the reputation that Primorska or Podravska Wine Region has. It is divided into three districts, from the biggest one in the Dolenjska region to the two smaller districts of Bizeljsko-Sremič and Bela Krajina.

Reputation achieved or not, there was always room to report on the grape harvest. A longtime TV correspondent from Posavje Goran Rovan filed this excellent report on the last days of the 1999 grape harvest.

The best-known varieties of wines from the Posavska Wine Region are Blaufränkisch and the Gelber Muskateller varieties, Cviček and Bizeljčan. Dolenjska district in particular prides itself on traditional light, reddish wine called Cviček that boasts official EU protection. Cviček is a fresh, light and slightly sour wine with a relatively low alcohol level. It is a blend of Modra Frankinja, Žametna Črnina, Krajevina, Laški Rizling, Rumeni Plavec and Zeleni Silvanec.

The late nineties and early 2000s were years of Slovenia’s integration into the European Union. In December 1997 Slovenia was included in the first round of countries for the start of negotiations that ended at the end of 2002 with an agreement on Slovenia's accession conditions. In May 2004, Slovenia became a full member of the EU after completing the accession process. There and then, a whole new market opened up for viticulture business opportunities. In 2004, a new potential market was recognised, as we can observe in the next clip talking about Cviček entering the EU market.

Slightly smaller in the area but producing up to 30% more wine than the Podravska region, the Primorska region is the most developed of the three with an annual output of over 25 million litres. There is a very strong Italian influence in this area, in language, food, culture, architecture, and viticulture.

Sharing many of the same mineral-rich soils and mesoclimates as neighbouring Friuli-Venezia, the region is well-suited to viticulture. It has a climate that benefits from its proximity to both the Mediterranean and the Alps, meaning the area is sometimes called Slovenian California. Its four districts are Goriška Brda in the north, Vipavska Dolina (Vipava Valley) further south, Kras (Karst) along the border with Italy, and Slovenska Istra in the area on and adjacent to the coast.

The wine-growing region of Primorska is renowned for strong, dry wines. In Goriška Brda, directly on the border with Italy, renowned Slovenian winemakers produce white wines, such as Rebula, Chardonnay, Sauvignon, Pinot Blanc, and Pinot Gris, and red wines, such as Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. In the Vipava Valley, in addition to the established white and red wines, you can also taste indigenous wines, such as Zelen, Pinela, and Pikolit. The Karst Region is the area where a special Slovenian wine is produced – Teran. This wine has a very full flavour due to the red Karst soil (terra rosa). In the Slovenska Istra, known for the white Malvazija wine, quite a bit of the red Refošk wine is also grown.

The last correspondence from Primorska Wine Region sums up the results of the 1995 grape harvest and its wine quality.

Slovenians certainly love their wine. In fact, it’s said that 94% of all wine produced in Slovenia is consumed by its residents. Wine consumption in Slovenia is around 42 litres per capita per year, among the highest in the world.

In the past, people even used wine to pay taxes or as a means of exchange. But today, we use it to toast at crucial turning points in life. Even our anthem Zdravljica is actually a toast and it is one of the few non-militant anthems.

So, let’s raise a glass to Slovenian viticulture, winegrowers and the vast variety of Slovenian wines that are mostly unknown due to the simple fact they are just too good to be left any to export. Na zdravje!

Rosa Lemberg was a teacher, singer, actress and choir director who played an important role in Finnish-American labour movements in the early 20th century.

Born in 1875 in Omaruru, a small town in what is now Namibia, she was the daughter of British merchant Charles William Clay and a Bantu woman, Feroza Sabina Hasara.

Lemberg's early life is entwined with colonialism and missionary activities.

When Rosa was a small child, she was taken from her mother and placed with her father's consent in a missionary school in Owambo run by a Finnish couple, Karl and Ida Weikkolin.

She was baptised in 1881, and was known as Rosa Clay. Later, in 1888, the Weikkolins decided to return to Finland, bringing Rosa with them.

Rosa was expected to do housework for the Weikkolins, and in her later memoirs, makes it clear that the couple were not the benefactors they painted themselves to be.

For a few years, the family toured Finland at religious events and concerts. Rosa was forced to sing songs and carols, and collected money from audiences. As a young Black woman, she was unique in Finnish society, and treated as an 'exotic' attraction.

In 1890, the family travelled back to Namibia, but Karl Weikkolin died shortly afterwards so again the family returned to Finland.

Rosa attended school there for a few years, and aged 19, began studying at a teacher training seminary in Karelia. Rosa's first job as a teacher several years later was in a small rural town, where she was treated with prejudice and bullied. She moved to Tampere, a bigger city and, while holidaying, met her fiancé, a Russian doctor. Sadly their engagement ended in tragedy when her fiancé died, after having tested a new medicine.

Grief-stricken, Rosa decided to move to the United States in 1904.

There, she became very involved in Finnish-American organisations and societies.

She performed, directed theatre plays, and led choirs. Initially Rosa lived in New York and, following her marriage to Finnish-American playwright Lauri Lemberg, lived in Michigan, Washington, Oregon and Illinois.

As a teacher and campaigner, Rosa was involved in Finnish-American socialist organisations and trade unions. She remained an important influential figure in the cultural activities of the Finnish-American labour movement into her 70s.

Rosa Lemberg died in Covington, Michigan in 1959, aged 84.

In 1942, Rosa's memoirRosaliawas published, which is how we know today about her childhood in Africa and Finland. The book was published in Finnish in the United States, authored by Arvo Lindewall.

Of mixed-race heritage, today Rosa Lemberg is often remembered as 'the first Black Finn' - an important figure showing that the history of Black people in Finland is not simply recent. While this status cannot easily be confirmed historically, the story of Rosa's life illustrates the prejudicial and discriminatory experiences of Black people in Finland as well as being a celebration of her achievements and talents.

Exploring the city's European colonial architecture

Malacca, a city in Malaysia, is a popular destination for tourists - especially for Singaporeans, it is a nice weekend getaway. European tourists also find their way to the coastal town. Malacca has a rich but turbulent multicultural history, a lot of which is tied to a number of colonial buildings which are painted in vibrant red.

These striking, distinctly European-looking buildings are in the historical centre of the city around Bukit St. Paul Hill, located on across the river from the old town. Both the old town and the red buildings have been recognised as World Heritage Sites by UNESCO since 2008.

Why the buildings - some from the 20th century, others constructed centuries ago - are a deep red colour is a mystery. To shed some light on this, we must look at their history.

Malacca started as a small fishing village, but would grow out to become a successful pivot in the Middle East and the Far East. In the 15th Century the Sultanate of Malacca was founded, marking the growth of its esteem and the start of improved trade relations with other countries such as Ming China. Throughout the 15th and 16th centuries, Malacca grew in importance as a capital and port, with Arab and Indian suppliers walking its streets. Thanks to the arrival of the Chinese admiral Zheng He, contacts with China intensified.

In 1511 the Portuguese colonised Malacca, making it part of Portugal's wide network of trade.

This heralded the start of European influence and acculturation in Malacca. The Portuguese built a fortress (fortaleza) on Bukit St. Paul Hill during their rule, on top of the pre-existing wooden Malay fortress. The walls and bastions of the fortress were built using Laterite, a rock with a ruddy red colour that is often used in the region.

In 1641, a Dutch colonial fleet took control of Malacca, after which it became an important port of call in the network of the East Indian trade. Until 1795, Malacca would be occupied by the Dutch East India Trade Company (VOC).

When the Dutch took Malacca from the Portuguese, they added a stately town hall built after the example of the Dutch city of Hoorn. Soldiers and enslaved people started construction on the town hall in 1641, finishing it in 1660.

The Portuguese Catholic Church on Bukit St. Paul became a Protestant Church under Dutch rule. To celebrate 100 years of occupation by the East Indian Trade Company in 1753, the VOC built a new church. The church on the hill would henceforth be called the Bovenkerk (the Upper Church), while the new church was named the Benedenkerk (the Lower Church) and is now known as Christ Church.

In the 19th Century, the East Indies trade started to dwindle, and with it the importance of Malacca as a trading post. The Dutch state officially ceded Malacca to the British in 1824. It took until 1957 for Malaya to gain its independence.

Under Dutch rule, all buildings were painted a stark white: the Town Hall, the Benedenkerk, the offices and warehouses of the VOC. We know that this colour changed sometime after ceding Malacca to the British in 1795. But when exactly?

John Turnbull Thomson painted the town hall in 1848 using different shades of grey:

But in this picture of 1885, the old Dutch buildings are still, or once again, painted white.

Another photograph of Christ Church in 1910 shows the church painted white.

In the 1920s, a photograph of the town hall shows white walls, as well as the newly constructed clock tower.

Finally, in the 1930s, a photograph shows the clock tower, Christ Church, and the town hall in what looks to be a red colour, although we can't be sure from this black and white image.

Online travel blogs have several different explanations as to why the buildings are painted red today.

Some say the East Indian Trade Company painted them red because every time it rained the red earth of Malacca spattered onto the originally white walls, which looked unseemly. In Malacca a lot of people also chew sirih pinang, or betelnut: a seed that has stimulant properties when chewed. Chewing betelnut makes you need to spit a lot, and your saliva changes colour to a bright orange-red. The story goes that Malaccan people would purposefully spit on the colonial building walls as a form of protest against the colonial rule.

So maybe the buildings were painted red to avoid visible red betelnut stains on the walls?

A third theory comes from the idea that Malacca's old town developed into a sort of Chinatown district under British rule: this would explain the red colour which is often used in Chinatowns, traditionally bringing good luck.

On the Bukit St. Paul Hill, however, the buildings were still white in 1935, as this photograph shows.

In 2006, Malacca was awarded Unesco World Heritage status. In 2013-2014, the multinational company AkzoNobel aided in the 'restoration' of this heritage, painting all the buildings on the town hall square red, the same colour that the British had painted these buildings for a small part of the 20th Century. Even though the buildings on this square had been white for more than 300 years, the red colour introduced in the interbellum makes the square a striking place of heritage to visit and experience.

The real reason for painting the buildings red in the 1930s might forever be lost to time, but they have contributed to the pull of tourists to Malacca. Despite their unhistorical red colour, these buildings make Malacca stand out as a very attractive destination.

Mirjam van Immerzeel worked and lived in Malacca in 2007-2008 as a correspondent for Dutch and Belgian news media, and still often returns to the city. She is now working for Dutch daily Het Financieele Dagblad in the Netherlands. Her search for the multicultural history of Melaka has already taken her to archives in Riga, London, Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur.

Exploring interior architecture in the Middle Ages

Could you live in a medieval castle? Despite needing a lot of money to be able to  afford the luxury of building a castle, living in a castle today may seem rather miserable due to how under-developed they were as buildings during the Middle Ages. No matter how the interior spaces were  decorated, rooms were less furnished and darker (especially in winter) than we are used to today.

The most popular castles of Europe were built on the top of high cliffs. Besides the wonderful views, this had the advantage that approaching enemies could be seen sooner, as well as the rough terrain making their access harder to the enemy.

As it was very expensive to build stone castles, during the early Middle Ages, wood was usually used. In terms of heating and insulating, we can see how under-developed these early times were by the fact that inhabitants of wooden castles built their living rooms above the sties, trying to benefit from the  natural heat that the animals' bodies emitted.

Although few written records survive about medieval architecture, it is certain that one of the most significant tools of constructions in the 13th century – and one of the most important architectural inventions – was the treadwheel crane.

It consisted of a large wheel that was driven by two people who stepped inside the wheel and walked continuously on the inner surface of it. Their weight forced the wheel to turn. Thus, the turning wheel pulled construction materials, for example stones for a wall, with the aid of ropes and cogwheels. A crane operator was also needed to drive the tool. This crane represented huge progress compared to earlier times, because three people could do tasks that previously needed a dozen. Nonetheless,  building a castle remained a laboursome and cost-demanding task, as can be seen in this extract from a letter written by master builder Magistro Jacobo de Sancto Georgio about the construction of the castle of Beaumaris in the 12th century:

'In case you should wonder where so much money could go in a week, we would have you know that we have needed – and shall continue to need 400 masons, both cutters and layers, together with 2,000 less skilled workmen, 100 carts, 60 wagons and 30 boats bringing stone and sea coal; 200 quarrymen; 30 smiths; and carpenters for putting in the joists and floor boards and other necessary jobs. All this takes no account of the garrison... nor of purchases of material. Of which there will have to be a great quantity... The men's pay has been and still is very much in arrears, and we are having the greatest difficulty in keeping them because they have simply nothing to live on.'

Looking at today's castle museums and ruins, you might think that the interior walls of medieval castles were not decorated a lot, but it is not true.

White walls were covered with paints made out of powdered and boiled minerals mixed with egg white, resin or oil. Besides oriental motifs, which were spread by the crusaders, plant motifs and floral decoration elements were also rather popular.

According to 15th-century sources, castles were minimally furnished. In these castles, the chest was the most used furniture, used instead of wardrobes and sometimes as chairs too. Wardrobes were not spread generally until the end of the Middle Ages. Their use increased when clothes did not have enough space anymore in the chests.

In winter, it was difficult to heat thick walls, so some rooms were insulated  better than others. A layer of wild-boar skin was fixed to the wall and covered with wooden panels. Besides panels, tapestry also appeared and came into fashion in the course of time, introducing instructive and entertaining stories. Inhabitants of castles slept in baldachin beds (curtained around), climbing up four large steps to go to bed.

As hot air rises upwards, the bed was always located at a warmer place. There was at least one toilet on each floor, which was placed in the closet built on the outer walls. It consisted of a stone tablet with a large hole in the middle.

Medieval rooms were rather dark, especially in winter. Before inventing the window-pane, windows were covered with wooden panels and parchment in order to insulate. Later, the appearance of leaded window-panes raised the comfort level of the castles significantly. They contained round-shaped glasses (quarries), but spread very slowly, because they were too expensive.

However,  window panes were a big step forward, because they let in much more light than the earlier solutions did. They became fashionable only in the 15th-16th centuries - afterwards, their production was industrialised and they became affordable for the lords of castles.

Besides different events, castle inhabitants organised feasts with guests, elegant masquerades, known as bacchanals and banquets. The guests danced and listened to music, and their entertainment was ensured by the comedian of the period – a court clown – who practised this profession for money. Researchers have proven that by finding records of monthly wages to the court dwarf and the court clown in the budget accounts of the Castle of Burghausen from 1477.

At the feasts, noblemen of castles often ate venison which they had hunted. The main course was, for example, wild-boar, pheasant or quail, crane and swan. In the world of medieval castles, people did not know the tomato, the potato or the paprika - these only reached Europe at the end of the 15th century after the discovery of America. Instead of refrigerators, they used a 'fridge' hollowed into the wall to keep food fresh. Beer brewing was a task for women, but the amount sometimes proved to be scarce. The accounts of the Castle of Burghausen from 1477 recorded the total cost of drinks: 1185 buckets of beer and twice as much wine had been purchased.

The favourite amusement of noblemen of castles was playing chess or backgammon, while servants preferred playing draughts. However, life in a castle was not all about amusement, because they were attacked from time to time. Though, in fact this happened rarely – on average once in every 75 years. In case of an attack, the strategic activities came into the limelight immediately.

Paying a dowry (i.e. a payment of money or property from the family of the bride to the family of the groom at the time of marriage) is an ancient custom that is still being practised in many countries and by many communities in the world. Originally, dowries were paid to the bride or the bride's family, not the other way around! The original purpose of a dowry was to compensate the bride’s family for the loss of her labour and her reproductive potential. Somewhere before the start of the Ancient Roman period, the custom became reversed, so that the bride's family had to give a dowry to the husband’s kin.

A bride's dowry consisted of a lot of clothing, very often crafted by the bride herself, or by her family. Every button, every tassel, every belt and apron were testimonies of the bride's skill in the crafts of sewing, weaving, embroidery, etc. Clothing, bedding, rugs and wall decorations were also important items for a newlywed couple to furnish their home with.

The custom of crafting and giving dowries has held strong throughout the centuries. Crafting a dowry was often an activity that all women in a family group partook in, starting from when a girl was born in anticipation of her wedding. Young girls learned to weave at a young age, as well as stitching and embroidery, enabling them to start work on their dowry in their teen years. Women used the hand-crafted items of their dowries as canvases to weave their aspirations, wishes, and personal tastes into the fabrics that would furnish their future home. This almost transcendental exercise was like "touch-magic",  crafting the soul of the weaver into their dowries, with their chosen materials, illustrations and patterns  reflecting their personality and instilling a totemic significance into these objects.

Besides the spiritual aspects of weaving, the creative output was rich with information – colours, symbols, patterns and decorations that denoted social rank and status, even recorded local history and folktales, at the same time acting as a kind of protective talisman.

In traditional Greek culture, aprons, in particular, were highly symbolised. The colour and patterns in an apron played a key role as a messaging status, perhaps similar to the role that social media status updates play for us today. There were special aprons that signify that the girl wearing them was unmarried, others were worn only by newlyweds and some were only worn when trying to conceive, or when a woman was a widow or spinster. For each age or status, there were corresponding symbols promoting health, prosperity and safety and communicating to the rest of the community details about the woman’s life stages and accomplishments.

The industrial revolution changed production and consumption patterns on a massive scale in the 20th Century. More and more textiles were mass-produced and store-bought, diminishing the need for personally crafted clothing and furniture. The position of the woman as a homemaker diminished and the tradition of passing dowry creation skills from generation to generation slowly extinguished.

Partly fueled by the feminist rhetoric of the time, partly influenced by the male-dominated modernist aesthetics and heavy urbanization, the hand-made quality of dowry clothing and rural styles no longer appealed to the modern eye. As women started grappling with public roles and careers in modern homes, their textile matrilineal heritage stayed wrapped in a closet, unadmired and unused.

It is not until the beginning of the 21st century that the concept of a dowry started being revisited as a testimony to female creativity and artistic heritage. While the early feminist rhetoric dismissed dowries as anachronistic and misogynistic, post-feminist discourse reinterprets the heritage of female creativity. Besides recognizing that women drew a big sense of accomplishment, pride and satisfaction from this seemingly menial and repetitive work while strengthening social ties with other women, contemporary feminist theory explores the role of the woman as a creator.

Dowry as a subject is being explored by many contemporary textile and mixed media female artists, who also explore social and community histories, practices, and sometimes even their own family history, as textile arts often have matrilineal heredity. New scientific and artistic practices and research in feminist anthropology are taking place, which investigate the social identity of women through their creativity, as well as the political aspects of crafts as a vehicle for female empowerment and activism, such as subversive stitching or yarn bombing.

Female craftsmanship can be finally celebrated and dowry items cherished, both as precious links to our matrilinear heritage and as a sui generis art form filled with totems of meaning, protection, incredible skill and above all, beauty.

Julie Legrand is a French visual artist and teacher at the municipal school of plastic arts in Beauvais (North of France). She uses diverse media in her art, but the use of glass is a recurring theme in her work. Julie's self-taught journey and her experimental approach give a whole new dimension to working with glass.

Julie Legrand, please could you introduce yourself and your work in a few words?

I am a visual artist, and sculptor. I work mainly in volume and drawing on autonomous pieces, places, eco-friendly works and installations. My artistic work is fed by the hazards of my own life. My work is not completely biographical but is rather a distillation of my own emotions. I transcribe the questions I ask of myself and of my relationship with others and society in my art.

Your techniques and mediums are numerous: how did you come to use them and how did you develop them?

I started working with salvaged elements from my daily life: objects I found on the street while walking around: threads, rubber bands, spools, and mundane objects. After attending art school, I did a residency at the Centre d'art contemporain d'Albi (France), and I visited a glass bottle factory for the first time. This visit was a huge trigger, I was emotionally and physically touched by the heat and malleability of molten glass. From then on, I never stopped trying to get closer to this material.

I made my two first installations with recycled glass, and then two or three years later, I went visited the studio of the famous French glassmaker Alain Villechange for three weeks. This greatly confirmed my interest in this material, which led me to make my own kiln and teach myself to work and experiment with this medium. The glass came to mix with the materials and objects I was already using, creating the first layer of hybridity in my work.

There were techniques on which I had a “crush”, such as basketry, woodturning and ceramics. I learned basketry and woodturning in craft training centres, and for ceramics, was trained professionally at the Beauvais art school. I keep on learning and gaining experience in my craft through working. Often, I have a piece in mind that I do not know how to do entirely. So I go to find the knowledge and tools needed. Once I've found these, they ricochet off the objects and skills I already possess, resulting in works that I hadn't even imagined when starting on the project.

Do you consider your current artistic practice part of what we call “crafts”?

I don't label my work as art or craft. My positioning towards society is artistic: I search for cohesion between aesthetic relationships and intimate emotion in my work. I can do commissions, but only when I'm allowed a lot of improvisation and creativity. I can make a series of works, but I won’t redo them 10 years later. I use artisanal techniques, but they are generally modified by my experience and the other materials I encounter. I have worked with friends who are master glassmakers. As I am largely self-taught, I don't know how to do what they know, but they don't know how to do what I know. So we find ourselves teaching each other things.

Can you tell us about your work as a teacher?

I work at the municipal school of plastic arts in Beauvais, which welcomes children, teenagers and adults and hosts preparatory classes in fine arts, decorative arts, design and animation. My students have varied backgrounds: I work with young adults as well as people who are retired or changing their life course. Some of them already have a lot of experience, others don’t.

Through teaching, I've realised that I have a deep well of experience to draw from after twenty-five years of creating exhibitions. My goal as a teacher is to connect students with their own creativity and to let them discover as many things as possible. I don't want to make them copy my work, that would lock them in and create copycat relationships that are not interesting.

Teaching pushed me to learn things that I didn't necessarily need to know for my own artmaking because I felt it was important for my students. It took me out of my own needs and into theirs, and the funny thing is that after three years, what I learned to pass on to my students is helpful to me in my personal creations in the studio afterwards. I find it very nice to be able to go back and forth.

You tend to combine traditional techniques with contemporary topics such as diversity and the environment, how and why do you create this contrast?

When we make sculptures or installations, we work with materials that we buy, glaze or grow. So either we are in a mode of recycling, which is already economical and ecological, or we use ready-made materials.

In recent years, we have been confronted with the question of the future of the object. How to organise the task of collecting and recycling waste has been on my mind lately. This creates all kinds of discussions with people who have nothing to do with the art world, which finally opens up a whole new field. I set up a partnership with a big local industrial waste disposal centre, so that my students can be more aware of their surroundings and environmental impact. It has allowed these students to take that info and act at their own scale. We've also partnered with a local fab lab, which allows us to think about how objects are built, repaired and repurposed.

Teaching in municipal schools creates the unique opportunity of bringing people of different age groups, lived experiences and skills together. This leads to students teaching each other and helping each other out. Working with fab labs has allowed us to bring technology closer to our students, allowing them to learn to use different computer programs and tools, like laser cutters for instance. Our project consisted of laser engraving glass, which we then reworked into stained glass in the workshop. We find ourselves making alliances between very advanced, ultra-modern and ancestral techniques.

Can you tell us a bit more about upcoming events and projects that you're involved in?

I'm representing France at theBiot International Glass Festivalthis year. This exhibition starts in August and ends in January 2023. I've also been invited by Eliane Nagata and her galleryTen Eventsto the Glass Week in Venice (Italy) in September, and by theValérie Delaunay galleryin Paris (France) for an event at the Palais Royal. In October, I'm holding my first solo exhibition at theMusée de Verrein Conches-en-Ouche (France), followed up by a second exhibition in January at theBailliage d'Aire-sur-la-Lys(France), in collaboration with the Museum and the School of Plastic Arts in Saint-Omer (France). The exhibitions in Venice, Conche-en-Ouche and Saint-Omer are the first steps of a trilogy around the themeAvoir lieu d'être(“To be”),  conceived in different ways in the three places.

Vienna, 1928

Istanbul, 1934

Amsterdam, 1928

Hamar, 1953

London, 1921

When we attend a sporting event, we look forward to following the game, the match, the fight. But sometimes, turning around to watch the spectators and audience can be just as rewarding.

The emotional reactions of sports fans - their wins and losses, their successes and frustrations - can be etched on their faces, both individually and as a crowd. Similarly, spectators bring energy and support for the teams.

This blog looks at a few paintings and photographs depicting sports fans. Take a moment to explore the many faces and people in these images, and explore the fascinating world of sport fans.

This painting of a crowded stadium is by Austrian landscape and portrait Anton Karlinsky. Dating from 1928, it was originally called 'Red card' but now bears the titleSoccer match on the Hohe Warte sports field.

It depicts a match at Vienna's Hohe Warte stadium, full of spectators. It is striking that all of those that we can identify seem to be men.

TheHohe Warte stadiumwas opened in 1921. At the time, it could host a crowd of thousands - with 85,000 people attending a match between Austria and Italy in 1923.

Several hundred spectators are tightly packed into a stand at Taksim Stadium in 1934, watching a football match between Turkish teams Galatasaray and Fenerbahçe in November 1930.

Taksim Stadium was the first football stadium in Istanbul. The overall attendance of this match was close to 5,000 people, although the stadium could accommodate 8,000.

They attentively follow the events taking place. The crowd is predominantly male, most of the men and women are wearing long coats and hats, or are holding hats in their hands. The playing field extends away from the stand. However, despite the fans undoubted support, the game ended in a 0-0 draw.

A huge crowd are watching the football final of the 1928 Olympic Games between Uruguay and Argentina.

Presumably most of the crowd are locals from the Netherlands or other European countries as undoubtedly not many Uruguaryan or Argentinian fans could travel the vast distances from south America to the Netherlands. In the run-up to the match, the Dutch Olympic organisers had received 250,000 requests for tickets from all across Europe.

These spectators are wrapped up warm for the winter, wearing wooly hats, scarves and gloves. They are watching the 1953 European Speed Skating Championships, taking place in Hamar, Norway a town to the north of Oslo.

They may well be cheering on Norwegian skater Ivar Martinsen who took a bronze medal in the Allround championships.

The Hamar stadion, which hosted the championships, were described as 'the Mecca of speed skating' by Kees Broekman, the Dutch skater who took gold in the Allround championships.

The supporters of Tottenham Hotspur football club seem to have gotten hold of the FA Cup, or maybe it's just a replica. Either way, the Tottenham Hotspur team did win the FA Cup in 1921, the year this photograph was taken. These fans seem very happy, and we can probably guess why.

The Spurs team won 1-0 against Wolverhampton Wanderers in the match which was played at the Stamford Bridge stadium in London.

--------------------------------------------------

In Cetona, a pretty Tuscan village in the province of Siena in Italy, we met Maïté Mazel, director of Citema, which stands forCité européenne des métiers d'art(= European city of Crafts). Citema is a network of art professionals who work to imagine, redesign, and reinvent models of thinking, living and doing together. With her, we tried to understand how art craftsmanship can contribute to social transformation in the current era.

Maïté, what is the path that led you to the creation of Citema?

I was born in Canada, raised in France, and studied theatre in Paris. I wanted to become an actress. I graduated in history of theatre at Sorbonne University and then I had the opportunity to go to work as a volunteer in Senegal, where I organized cultural activities in schools. It's there that I first came in contact with art craftsmanship. In looking for solutions to develop activities for children, I met local artists and artisans. With them, we redesigned, completely with recycled material, the children's library. It was a wonderful experience.

After that, I went to Namibia to work in the civil service for the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. I dealt with cultural planning and I organized a residency on artistic craftsmanship, mainly focused on ceramics. I involved Senegalese, French, South African, and Namibian artisans. Everyone spoke a different language, so we had to communicate using signs and body language. This experience inspired me to open a residence centre for artistic craftsmanship in Italy, the country I have always loved. This is how Citema, Cité européenne des métiers d'art, came into existence.

Citema is a European centre for where different art professions can meet and exchange experiences. What do you mean byart professions?

Citema was born as a centre for European artisans. We created a network of artisans, with whom we organised meetings, exhibitions, and workshops. After three years of working with artisans, we realised we wanted to broaden our scope and bring in designers, architects, performance artists and more into the network. Culture is an ecosystem: the definition of artisanship is much broader than 'someone who works with their hands'. This is why we opened up our centre to those who create art with their bodies and minds. To me, this is how I define the art professions: those that create art with their hands, bodies and minds.

Citema is defined as a research project on the theme of social transformation and personal fulfilment. How exactly does this project materialize?

It is not a simple question, and we have been reflecting on it from the beginning. Thinking that an art craftsperson can transform society seemed a purely theoretical assumption at first. In fact, we quickly realized that every time we use our body, we put it back at the centre of society. Therefore an art craftsperson is absolutely involved in social transformation: they use natural or chemical resources in their work, and they must transmit their skills to others in order not to lose their memories and be able to allow transformation.

In concrete terms, art craftspeople participate in social transformation when their hands and body are used. Let's take the example of the potter: how can a potter participate in social transformation? By asking themselves and their environment questions. Let's talk about transforming the environment, for instance. By no longer using lead glazes that pollute the environment or are bad for our health, by limiting the production of waste, and by learning to recycle, we can transform our environment for the better. Then we also need to transmit all these lessons learnt to the new generation. Through Citema we can have potters collaborate with the world of digital designers, academics, and farmers, in order to find concrete solutions for real social transformation together.

How does Citema involve local populations?

At first, we thought it was enough to prepare some regular events and invite everyone to get involvement from our local community. When we participated in a project called "Trans-making", a project on social transformation, we took this a step forward: we wanted to proactively get in touch with people, so we could learn what their sensitivities were and have them influence our work.

We had to merge with them, not let them come to us. We started working together with local farmers, for example. In 2014 we created a collective called “Corriente Compartida”, which includes Spanish, Cuban, French and Italian people. Corriente Compartida means the current that is transmitted because we share the same sensitivities as if we're sharing an electrical current. We started organising meetings, hosted in the houses of the participants, with a focus on highlighting how local communities lived: by producing and consuming local products, by sharing their resources.

Our meetings were held in Spain, France and Italy, always in places where locals would gather, far away from the neighbourhoods where tourists roamed. Improvised activities would spring up, we would start a pottery workshop together or would cook a meal together. This allowed us to experience the local culture much deeper than a tourist would be able to, by conversing with locals and learning about their recipes, traditions and festivals. We take the time to experience these places, in the hope that it will inspire us to create new art and crafts.

How do the creation and visibility of art crafts interact with public spaces, in your opinion?

We would like Citema to be a nomadic space, not bound to local identity, but rather an ethereal space that adapts to the local customs wherever it goes.

We've called this new nomadic space “BicyCommon”. The word Bicy is related to the idea of movement, and Common shows that this is a common good. The idea is to no longer think of an identity necessarily linked to a territory, but of a collective identity.

Public space allows us to detach ourselves from any identity, to leave closed spaces, and propose a sharing of emotions, beauties, actions, and experiences.

The Greek presence in Asia Minor

Greeks in Smyrna in the end of 19th century and before 1922

The Catastrophe of 1922

The refugees’ settlement in Greece

The impact on Greek society

Marking 100 years since the end of the Greco-Turkish War

100 years ago, the Greek-Turkish war - which had begun in 1919 after the end of World War I - ended with a crushing defeat of the Greek forces. Greek populations, which had spread across the coast of Asia Minor over centuries, were either massacred or fled to Greece as refugees. Greece was shattered from the Asia Minor Catastrophe - which still remains one of the most tragic events of modern Greek history.

The Greek presence on the western coast of Asia Minor began with the First Greek Colonisation in the Geometric era, in the 11th century B.C. Cities like Ephesus, Pergamum, Miletus and Halicarnassus were particularly important cultural centres in Antiquity, surviving Persian rule and flourishing during the Hellenistic era. Asia Minor was also extremely important for the Byzantine Empire. The Greeks in Asia Minor endured Ottoman rule. Towards the end of the 19th century, the Greek Christians of the region played an important role in the economic development of the coastal cities, especially Smyrna and its surroundings.

Smyrna was a city of a unique cosmopolitan character, full of European travellers and traders, especially during the last decades of the 19th and the early 20th centuries. Turks, Greeks, Jews and Armenians lived together in peace. The Greek community of the city was the largest in population and its members were highly esteemed professionals, working as bankers, traders, lawyers and doctors. Smyrna’s schools where the Greek language and history were taught were particularly important

Smyrna’s cultural significance was always highly praised. For example, the city had its own distinct musical tradition, such as the ‘tsifteteli’, ‘karsilama’ and ‘rebetiko’ music genres which were brought to Greece by the refugees of 1922. The bourgeois class of Smyrna was in turn nurtured in European and classical music.

Greek authorities thought that World War I was an opportunity to claim the territories of Asia Minor populated by Greeks.

Greece participated in the war on the side of the ‘Entente’ forces while the Ottoman Empire sided with the ‘Central Powers’. After the defeat of the Central Powers, the Treaty of Sèvres was signed in 1920, according to which Greece would acquire the territories of Eastern Thrace and take over the governance of the Smyrna region for 5 years with the prospect of its integration after a referendum.

The Greco-Turkish war had already started from 1919 and lasted until 1922. The Greek army had advanced in the inland of Asia Minor without the approval or the support of the European allies (England, France and Italy). At the same time, Kemal Ataturk's Turkish nationalism was gaining more and more strength and external support, both financial and military.

100 years ago, in the summer of 1922, the front collapsed and the Greek army retreated in disorder.

At the end of August 1922, the Turkish army entered Smyrna. Greek populations were massacred and Greek cities and villages were destroyed. Greeks who did not meet a tragic death left as refugees for Greece.

More than 1.2 million people came to Greece from Asia Minor as refugees.

At first they were hastily settled in public buildings, such as schools, hospitals, public services’ buildings, theatres, but also in train carriages and even in the countryside in makeshift facilities and stalls.

Local Greeks were often hostile towards the refugees, even though they shared the same religion and similar education and culture.

In particular, Greek women coming from Asia Minor often encountered a strong prejudice against them. As their husbands were either dead or held captive by the Turks,  women from Asia Minor often had to confront locals’ prejudice, who labelled them as prostitutes who wanted to 'seduce' local men.

The refugees from Asia Minor to Greece contributed a lot to the Greek economy, society and culture. Settling in Greece, they brought with them everyday habits, customs,culture, as well as  culinary and musical tradition. All these cultural elements survived and remain powerful to this day.

The Asia Minor Catastrophe constitutes a milestone in modern Greek history. The testimonies of the people who lived these tragic events, as the above presented testimonies of the Asia Minor refugees, not only provide us with a vivid narrative of the tragic events, but also propose an alternative 'history from below'.

How to safeguard transient, traditional and untouchable culture

Intangible cultural heritage is a substantial part of what makes up our histories and identities, understood to be practices, ideas, insights and experiences.

What makes intangible cultural heritage amazing is that it isn't confined to historical practices, but also includes contemporary customs and traditions. Nor is it limited to mainstream or global phenomena: local practices of minority communities, too, are valuable expressions of cultural identity.

In the past, the importance of intangible heritage has not always been fully recognised and little effort was invested in documenting, preserving and sharing it. In fact, intangible heritage has often been used to accompany and explain tangible objects while it should be the other way around: intangible cultural heritage creates the necessary conditions for artifacts to be produced - for example, it’s because of impermanent performances that theatres were built.

Recently, intangible cultural heritage has started to gain attention from researchers, museum professionals, policy makers and audiences alike.

There's a growing awareness of the importance of cultural legacies, as they show the ways in which people come together to connect and to express themselves. Moreover, cultural practices form a vital element of a community's identity. Knowing about each other's traditions creates a backbone for how we interact with each other and helps us to understand differences as well as discover similarities and shared values.

There's a certain urgency about the heightened interest in intangible heritage: often, traditions and practices are passed on from individual to individual or generation to generation - a knowledge transfer chain that is strong and fragile at the same time.

Because of globalization, industrialisation and environmental challenges, intangible collections - like any other type of heritage - risk damage, destruction and even disappearance. It's therefore more important than ever to invest in safeguarding strategies, making use of the knowledge we already possess and continuously evolving new digital technologies.

The advocacy ofUNESCOas well as local, national and community-oriented heritage committees, have done a lot to raise awareness of the varied range of traditions and living expressions considered intangible cultural heritage. Furthermore, digital projects such asWEAVEamongst others are paving the way for the museums of the future, in which the physical and digital, the tangible and intangible jointly paint a picture of our past, present and future.

Their efforts foster a wider reflection about intangible heritage and how to take care of it, in turn revealing routes towards a more inclusive and diverse society.

Language and performance

Social practices and knowledge transfer

From panto to performance

What does 'cultural heritage' mean to you? Does your mind immediately turn to the iconic works of illustrious artists on show in museums and galleries? To the kilometres of shelves in public archives and libraries? Or to something more private - a photo album unfolding your family history generation by generation?

There might be a plethora of things that you consider important to preserve for the future. But we venture a guess that none of those things are 'untouchable' or intangible. Nonetheless, a substantial part of what makes up our history and identity are practices, ideas, insights and experiences.

In this blog, we give a hint as to the many flavours of intangible cultural heritage by exploring the five domains identified in UNESCO’sConvention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage(2003).

First, there are oral traditions including language as well as a wide range of expressions and modes of storytelling.

Oral heritage encompasses proverbs and tales, legends and myths, chants and prayers, poetry and children’s rhymes. Traditions such as those of theWeihnachtsmärchenhave regional variations all across the globe. The Christmas pantomimes famous in the English-speaking world, for instance, stem from the same 'family'.

Another domain is that of the performing arts, comprising dance, theatre and music at large: perhaps the most universal of all forms of intangible heritage. In all cultures and communities, music forms part of daily life but also marks special occasions, such as milestones in life, religious feasts and ritual practices.

Often, traditional practices are situated at the intersection of these domains. In the clip below, Sofia and Francisco Belchior demonstrate the fundamentals of the dance game Carraquinhas involving poetry, song and choreography.

Francisco e Sofia Belchior - A moda da carrasquinhafromDPAGDPonVimeo.

The wide variety of activities with which people mark the passing of the seasons, commemorations, historical or political events and religious or spiritual ideas is considered intangible cultural heritage as well. While, in some cases, participants adhere to a strict set of rules and scenarios, other traditions are quite informal and reflect changing times, lifestyles and community identities.

Carnival is an example found all over the world: a celebration that comes in many forms and guises but always involves celebratory excess in advance of a period of restraint and fasting. Some of the most illustrious parades and masked balls have even become tourist attractions.

The two remaining domains of intangible heritage both involve the transfer of knowledge and skills: those concerning nature and the universe, and those related to artisan production. As for the latter, it’s not so much the produce of traditional craftsmen as their insights and mastery of the creation process that are considered 'intangible' cultural heritage.

Initiatives supporting young creatives to get acquainted with centuries-old methods and techniques help to keep alive practices that are often central to a community's identity.

In the new millennium, traditional crafts have become endangered due to industrialisation and globalisation, migration, economic pressure and (the lack of) copyright laws.

Dealing with a changing world is very much at the core of the fifth and final domain of intangible cultural heritage: knowledge about fauna and flora, indigenous wisdom, ecological insights and traditional medicinal practices.

Spring or harvest feasts, for instance, reflect a knowledge of nature and insight in the turnings of the universe, specifically related to a certain locale, landscape or community.

As the pace of climate change increases and the severity of global crises unfortunately isn't waning, the safeguarding of such ancient knowledge is only growing: lessons learnt from the past are vital for our understanding of what a healthy, happy future for our planet might look like.

Why the ‘dark’ ages?

The Enlightenment

Reinterpreting the ‘Dark Ages’

20th century research

Medieval manuscripts and a new book trade

Debunking the myth of Middle Ages as a time of backwardness

For centuries, the terms ‘Dark Ages’ and ‘Middle Ages’ have been synonymous. Until very recently, they were used almost interchangeably to label a period ranging roughly from the fall of the Roman Empire (in the second half of the 5th century) to as early as the mid-13th century or as late as the first half of the 16th century. ‘The Dark Ages’ is a particularly loaded label, however. In fact, it is a value judgement, and, as with all value judgments, the extent of its ‘darkness’ is very much in the eye of the beholder.

In fact, for centuries, the Middle Ages have been referred to as an era of barbarism and economic, cultural and intellectual decline. This myth is so deeply rooted in Western culture that even to this day, when something is considered to be brutal, unsophisticated or outdated, one might describe it as being in the ‘Dark Ages’ or as being ‘positively medieval’. Today, most modern scholars agree that the ‘Dark Ages’ refer to a long and complex period of history, whose perceived ‘darkness’ throughout early modern times has depended heavily on changing political, ideological and religious pursuits and that, on the contrary, the Middle Ages were an era of great inventiveness during which art, architecture, literature, international trade and culture flourished.

The idea of a dark intermediary period between the Roman Empire and the Renaissance came from the mid-14th century Italian scholar, Petrarch, who divided history into two periods: the classical period in which Greeks and Romans brightened the world with their intellectual achievements, and a period of darkness and cultural stagnation (in which he himself felt to be living). 
Although ‘medieval’ people saw themselves as a continuation of Antiquity, the idea of intellectual darkness was not new to them. 9th-century Carolingian scholar,Walahfrid Strabo(a Latinist and a teacher), thought that the Carolingian Renaissance led by the emperor Charlemagne had been a bright period of learning and intellectual development, illuminating the darkness that had preceded it. However, having written many years after the Emperor’s death and during a civil war, Strabo regretted (as Petrarch would do centuries later) the decline of knowledge in his own ‘barbarous age’, which, according to him, was growing ever dimmer. Contrary to Strabo’s general pessimism about his own times, Petrarch did hope that ancient civilisation would be recovered and that he might even live to witness it.

During the Renaissance (the transition from the Middle Ages to modernity covering the 15th and 16th centuries), Petrarch’s idea of a dark and barbaric medieval past fed into humanists’ belief in their own present time as the rebirth of classical culture. This belief had been conditioned by the words of Giorgio Vasari, a 16th-century artist and art historian, who considered that Roman art had been the best and most divine of any other. Humanists, like Giorgio Vasari, believed that the period that had preceded them had been a dark intermediary time between the higher valued Classical Antiquity and the Renaissance. The ‘Middle Ages’ then, was a period that brought about the loss of the great intellectual achievements of Antiquity.

While humanists criticised what from their point of view was a lack of Latin language, literature and culture, 16th-century Protestant reformers did not see the ‘Dark Ages’ as being problematic since to them this period represented the rise and expansion of the Catholic Church and of papal and clerical corruption.

During the 18th century, these criticisms were what led the ‘Dark Ages’ to become the Enlightenment’s worst enemy.

As an intellectual and philosophical movement, the Enlightenment (late 17th and into the 18th centuries) was founded on the ideals of the pursuit of knowledge and happiness, reason, progress, light, and freedom. It was precisely the concept of democracy and freedom that led the German art historian, Johann Joachim Winckelmann, to bring the superiority of Greek art to the forefront, rejecting all art created in contexts of tyrannical rule. The Middle Ages, ruled by the Catholic Church and the monarchy, were seen to be obscure, full of superstition, hierarchy and serfdom. The new age of Enlightenment was a complete contrast and brought its own style of artistic expression -  'Neoclassicism' - that evoked the earlier and superior forms of art and thinking.

Below: The last meeting of the legendary Scandinavian princess Hillelil and her lover, the English prince Hildebrand, before he went off to battle and perished.

In the final years of the 18th century, the ‘Dark Ages’ started to take on new meanings.

The uncertainties caused by the French Revolution and the world's rapid industrialisation reversed the negative reputation of the Middle Ages. Many European nations began to see them as a time in which their national identities were founded and they could envision their political future. The rediscovery of founding myths, courtly literature and religious art made for a romanticised, exotic and nostalgic ‘Dark Ages’. Some people saw it as a time of impressive architecture and others as an age of harmony, chivalry and faith.

Coincidentally, this was also a time in which travellers started to re-discover (with romantic delight) the ruins of gothic churches and cathedrals, languishing and decaying with the passage of time. This general appreciation of the ‘Dark Ages’ in literature, (and later) art and architecture became widespread in the third quarter of the 19th century, and was not based as much on actual knowledge and appreciation of medieval culture and inventiveness as on a gothic taste for all that was morbid, quaint, sentimental and obscure.

The 20th century called into question the idea of the ‘Dark Ages’. Scholars began to study all aspects of medieval society and culture, gradually unveiling what, for centuries, had been a millennium we knew very little about. Their studies identified many periods of political, social, intellectual and economic Renaissance during the Middle Ages, and revealed that the philosophical and scientific roots of ‘The Renaissance of the Twelfth Century’ in particular, actually laid the foundations for the achievements of the Italian Renaissance and for the 17th century Scientific Revolution.

Below: This coin is inscribed in both Latin and Arabic. It was made for Offa (reigned 757-796), king of Mercia, and the design was copied directly from a dinar coin of the Abbasid caliph al-Mansur (754-775)

The 20th century also revealed a profoundly inter-connected world. Medieval international trade, for example, was so extensive that some 8th-century Anglo-Saxon coins were inscribed in both Latin and Arabic, revealing far-reaching connections. Christian missionary activity was also widespread, taking ancient knowledge to monasteries far and wide.

Tight links with the East led to the transmission of texts that were translated from Greek to Latin, copied and then studied. During the Carolingian Renaissance, these translations were reviewed and corrected, ensuring the preservation of classical texts. Education, knowledge and art became a driving force in recreating the splendours of Antiquity while building a unified Christian Empire. In fact, classical literature and philosophy were not ‘lost’ at all during the Middle Ages, they were just re-interpreted under the lens of Christianity and focused towards the most important of medieval pursuits: salvation.

Below: The opening page of the Gospel of Saint Matthew from a copy of the Four Gospels, made during the reign of the Emperor Charlemagne. It is written entirely in gold with headings in red.

The sheer amount of effort (and cost) that went into making and decorating a medieval manuscript reflects a profound appreciation for knowledge and the reader’s expectation of being ‘illuminated’ by the wisdom contained within the page. In fact, manuscripts produced during this period were of an immensely rich variety. Copies and translations were made of classical, historical, theological and liturgical texts. The latter in particular, because they contained the Holy Script, could boast the most intensely rich colours and gold ink, and created astonishing effects of fluctuating light. Owning and collecting one of these books was not only a sign of great culture but of power and wealth.

While it is true that only a small fraction of the population had access to written texts (or was capable of reading them), medieval knowledge and culture existed in multiple forms.

To begin with, the 11th and 12th centuries saw the foundation of the first universities (perhaps the most successful and lasting of medieval inventions) in cities such as Bologna, Oxford, Salamanca and Paris. University cities fostered a rising new book trade that laid out the foundations for the modern day printed book. Paintings and illuminations were also a means for acquiring knowledge. Bursting with colour and gold leaf, they invited the mind to wander (quite literally). Certain manuscripts told of the voyages and adventures of great explorers such as Marco Polo, depicting bizarre beings that populated the farthest corners of the earth (and yes, medieval people were aware that the earth was round!). The medieval world was a big and bustling place, and seals and coins enforced ideas of law and order as well as territorial identity.

Below: Bizarre mythical beings said to have been discovered by Marco Polo during his voyages through Asia

The Middle Ages were also a time of profound faith. Great knowledge, engineering and innovation went into building churches and cathedrals that have, effortlessly, stood the test of time. These medieval skyscrapers and their giant stained glass windows, have narrated sacred history while inundating space with light and colour.The so-called ‘Dark Ages’ were, in fact, not that dark after all.

The origins of the world’s oldest film festival

Along with the Berlinale and the Cannes Film Festival, the Venice Film Festival is one of the most important film competitions in Europe, and certainly the oldest.

The Venice film Festival started during a time when the Italian government wanted to deeply influence the film industry, using cinematography as an important tool for indoctrination and propaganda for the fascist regime.

Conceived and strongly desired by Count Giuseppe Volpi di Misurata, the Venice Film Festival saw its debut in 1932. The second edition was instead in 1934. Both editions were directed by Luciano De Feo, former director general of the Istituto Luce from 1924 to 1928.

In 1935, at the third edition of the lagoon festival, the Mussolini Cup, the equivalent of the current Leone d'Oro, was awarded to Casta Diva as the best Italian film and to Anna Karenina as the best foreign film.

Two years later, the blockbuster ‘Scipione l'Africano’ was awarded, a highly anticipated movie whose production was documented in many newsreels. The 1937 edition also saw the victory of a non-German movie, ‘Un carnet de bal’, as best foreign film. After 1938, the year in which Leni Riefenstahl got an award for Olympia, only movies created by the Allied nations will receive the Mussolini Cup.

In 1942, in the middle of the war, the last edition of the Film Festival in the fascist era was held: the winners were ‘Bengasi’ by Augusto Genina and ‘Il grande re’ by Veit Harlan. Among the guests of honour was the Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels.

After the war there was a deep desire to take part in public social life once again. In 1946, Venice Film Festival reopened its doors. In 1947, the State Secretary, Giulio Andreotti, opened the Festival by announcing the return of the Cinecittà cinema to its original purpose as a movie theater. After the war it had become a refugee camp.

Since then, newsreels have been following the Venetian Film Festival very closely. To give just one example, The newsreel La Settimana Incom, released from 1946 to 1965, dedicated 67 news stories to the Film Festival, often including several issues solely devoted to the Festival.

In 1948, the Shah of Persia Reza Pahlavi arrived at the Festival, where Roberto Rossellini presented the film "Amore", to which Jean Cocteau, also a guest of the event, contributed.

In 1949 the first ‘Leone d’Oro’ of the lagoon festival was awarded. Henri-Georges Clouzot won it with the movie ‘Manon’.

The Festival has become more and more of a worldwide event. Over the years, Italian and international actors and directors who have made the history of cinema showed up: in 1950 Vittorio De Sica and Anna Maria Pietrangeli showed up, while the 1951 edition saw the presence of ‘unexpected guests’, such as Winston Churchill.

In 1955 the guest of honour was definitely Olivia de Havilland. But together with her, also Linda Christian, Sophia Loren, Alberto Sordi, the writer Edmund Purdom and the US ambassador to Italy Clare Luce Boothe graced the Festival with their presence.

In 1958, the Leone d’Oro was awarded to the film ‘The Rickshaw Man’ by Japanese director Hiroshi Inagaki, while Sophia Loren won the Volpi Cup as best female performer.

The Sixties opened with a strong controversy: the film ‘The Rhine crossing’ by the French director André Cayatte won over the favourite Luchino Visconti, who presented his masterpiece, ‘Rocco e i suoi fratelli’.

The worldwide year of protests in 1968 was also felt in Venice, with a request from some filmmakers to self-manage the festival in the name of culture.

The last newsreel, present in the Luce archive that deals with the Festival is a Panorama Cinematografico from 1971, where extraordinary guests were presented: from John Ford to Vittorio De Sica, from Luchino Visconti to Gina Lollobrigida. Looking back at it now, the tone of the newsreel didn't match the time period any longer, and the jokes come over as stale.

In its place, television with its live broadcasts and its continuous updates ended up depriving the audience of newsreels, and this is true both in general and for social events in particular. From the 1970s onwards, television brought the stars of the Venice film show into the homes of Italians.

Treasure-trove

Lušperg

Tracing history through (virtual) heritage sites

The cat is out of the bag: sinceLonely Planet's endorsement of Sloveniaas one of the top 5 travel destinations in the world, its many attractions no longer are the privilege of connoisseurs but are becoming common knowledge. While the natural beauty of the country definitely is worth exploring, its cultural riches are substantial as well.

In this blog, we zoom in on some of Slovenia's heritage sites, with a beginner's guide to picturesque castles and evocative ruins illustrated by 3D models and digitised cultural heritage.

Covering 20,273 km² and home to more than two million citizens, Slovenia boasts no less than 29,359 examples of immovable cultural heritage, of which 8,470 are 'cultural monuments'. Small wonder that the country is keeping close track of its architectural treasures: Slovenia has been investing in professional care for immovable heritage since 1913. Moreover, the preservation and conservation of monuments and sites is described in the Slovenian Constitution and dedicated legislation has been put in place.

The preponderance of fortresses, palaces and other mansions with royal allures is all the more remarkable, since Slovenia has never been ruled by kings!

The fact that about 500 castles survive is largely due to the presence of thehouse of Habsburgin Slovenia from the 14th century until 1918. As a part of their legacy, castles in different styles survive, from massive medieval structures and renaissance palaces to lavishly detailed baroque chateaus. The buildings - or the ruins that still remain - offer a unique opportunity to travel back in time and explore the country’s history.

Svibno castle is a beautiful example, named in 14th-century manuscripts for the first time, but - according to legend - possibly dating back to the early 10th century.

Svibno castle is a beautiful example, named in 14th-century manuscripts for the first time, but - according to legend - possibly dating back to the early 10th century.

In the 14th century, the lords of Svibno pawned the castle to the lords of Celje - once vassals of the Habsburg dukes of Styria, who later rose to 'Reichsgrafen' and Princes of the Holy Roman Empire. An important new chapter began when the castle was acquired by the provincial counselor of Carniola in the 16th century. His (male) family line only came to an end in the 19th century.

The original castle had a medieval core extended towards the south on the slope of the Ostri every. Later on, it was fortified and protected by a new defence wall and renaissance towers. Nowadays the original form of the castle is barely recognisable from the ruins, as a large part of the old walls unfortunately was destroyed.

Prem Grad is a medieval castle in Brkini Hills, where it has dominated the Reka River Valley for over 700 years.

Like Svibno castle, Prem castle dates back to the middle ages, as documentary evidence shows that its construction was completed by 1213. Its roots could be even more ancient than that, as the castle is rumoured to have been built where once a Roman fortress was located.

The castle was first owned by theLords of Duino, vassals of the Patriarchs of Aquileia, but was inhabited by many other owners subsequently, including the Habsburg family and the Dukes ofPorcia. In 1927, it was bought by Italian doctor Bruno Zucculini as a summer residence. Today the castle is renovated and houses several museum collections, including an exhibit showing palatial heritage sites along the Reka River Basin.

For architecture enthusiasts, the Praetorian Palace in Koper is a must-see. The present building emerged after centuries of development and renovation. The current structure in late gothic-renaissance style was constructed in the late 15th century and boasts distinct Venetian features on the outside as well as lavish baroque interiors.

The 'palazzo' is only one storey high but generously decorated, featuring façade ornaments, an elegant staircase and Ghibelline swallow-tailed merlons.

While castles were often conceived as citadels - located high on a hill or mountain - or strategically located in the vicinity of a river, Lušperg Castle combines both. 607 metres above sea level, the site can only be reached via a daunting climb. The reward, however, is a panoramic view of the upper Dravinja Valley, at the confluence of the Dravinja and Ljubnica rivers.

Why the castle was built at this hard-to-reach spot remains unclear, but this very fact seems to be responsible for the abandonment of Lušperg in the early 16th century. The mighty mansion now is a humble ruin, sitting silently surrounded by outstanding natural beauty. The story of Lušperg, however, continues to intrigue and has become a piece of intangible cultural heritage in and of itself.

Ancient paths in Italy and thermalism

Properties of thermal waters

Not only Francigena

Culture of wellness

Cultural and natural heritage and sustainable tourism

Cultural and natural heritage in Italy

Thermal bath sites are tourist attractions today that date back centuries. In this blog, the rurAllure project introduces the heritage of thermal baths.

Since prehistoric times thermal springs, with their unusual colours, pungent smell and specific vapours, have attracted the attention of people who, at first, noticed the behaviour of the animals using the waters, and later learnt to use them by gradually exploring their therapeutic effectiveness. Thermal bath traditions date back to Antiquity, as mineral springs and waters were highly appreciated by Greeks, Etruscans and Romans, long before they became part of luxurious tourist offerings.

Natural thermal sites, together with healing practices that have been preserved to the present day, constitute an important cultural heritage that can be discovered, in particular, through walking along pilgrimage routes.

Starting from proto-historic times, groups of people, as well as individual pilgrims, have undertaken journeys, sometimes very long, to reach thermal sources with healing properties, often associated with a strong spiritual value.

Mineral water sites have been among the most visited destinations from Antiquity to the modern times. Here, the aura of sacredness and mystery emanating from springs was closely linked to therapeutic practices, known for the capacity to solve various health problems.

In Italy, there are numerous thermal heritage sites dating back to the Roman era located close to the major consular roads, which later became pilgrimage routes leading to Rome. Among them there are the Via Romea Strata, Via Romea Germanica and Via Francigena. These are routes that crossed all of Europe, taken by millions of pilgrims throughout centuries who, having just arrived in Italy, found it easier to rest their weary limbs.

Over millennia, thermal springs have preserved their role as a healing tool, as documented by numerous literary, iconographic and ethnographic testimonies. Today, the thermal heritage of historic pilgrimage routes, where the true wealth is found in the extraordinary nature of the mineral water and its derivatives, is often supported or substituted by modern therapeutic facilities.

Thermal waters can alleviate many pathologies, including those of skin, limbs, digestive and reproductive systems, as well as respiratory, visual or auditory organs, as witnessed by Vitruvius, Pliny the Elder and Seneca, to mention just the best-known names from the Roman era.

The healing properties of the waters depend both on their chemical composition, being rich in minerals. as well as the fact that they emerge from under the ground at different temperatures (hypothermal, cold: below 20°; homeothermal, tepid: 20°-30°C; hyperthermal, hot: above 30°C). Both of these combine to offer the possibility of specific treatments on site.

Apart from the Via Francigena pilgrimage route, which passes through several important thermal hotspots (thermal towns of Acqui Terme, Salsomaggiore, Tabiano, Gambassi Terme, Viterbo and many others) and have been receiving a growing interest from visitors and pilgrims, there are numerous thermal heritage gems along other historic paths crossing Italy.

For example, on the Via Romea Strata, we can also highlight the important spa towns of the Euganean Hills, in the province of Padua, among whichMontegrotto Termestands out. The water in the Euganean section is salty-bromine-iodine and hyperthermal. It gushes out at 87 degrees but is used at 36-38 degrees to treat joints, muscular pain and atrophy, for rehabilitation after traumas, fractures and surgery. Euganean thermal mud is also employed.

There are several archaeological sites in the spa town, three of which can be visited, dating from the 1st century B.C. to the 4th century A.D., and the Museum of Ancient Thermalism and Territory has recently been opened.

How does the mineralisation of these waters occur, making them the same today as they were 3,000 years ago? It is a long and complex process that begins with rain: falling on the ground surface, rain seeps underground and is enriched with minerals present in the rocks.If it then encounters heat flows of the earth, it heats up and returns to the surface with particular chemical and physical properties and at different temperatures. They are therefore very different types of waters including those we drink and are called 'oligomineral' waters.

In addition, mineral waters may occur in nature taking the form of springs, ponds or muddy puddles. In some cases, the underground water is transformed into gas and upon leaking to the surface is not visible, but may reveal itself by smell or by absence of living beings in the vicinity, as there are deadly gaseous emissions.

Over the millennia, humans have constantly dealt with geothermal phenomena, at first linking them to the presence of gods capable of making water gush out at high or effervescent temperatures, perhaps reddish (because rich in iron salts), or oily (because bituminous). Later, health resorts were built at those springs, in which, today, specialised physicians receive patients, as priests used to do in the past for ritual and votive practices.

However, already in Roman times, there were not only therapeutic facilities (called Thermae, Aquae or Fontes) at the mineral springs but, then as now, there were also hospitality and recreational areas. Some of those thermal sites continue to be in demand for millennia, due to the long-lasting fame of their curative effects, as well as the historically rich natural landscapes that host them.

Thermal heritage therefore represents a unique natural phenomenon, as well as an important natural and cultural asset. These very special waters combine geology, thermal landscapes, rituals and social practices, and stories and legends, transmitted from generation to generation.

Due to the fragile nature of thermal archaeological heritage and the fact that thermal springs are often located in rural settings, away from popular tourist destinations, they do not receive deserved attention and risk being neglected.

Slow tourism developments might encourage travellers to discover these healing spots  immersed in unique natural environments. That is why pilgrimage routes in line with sustainable development initiatives, such as the rurAllure project, play an important role in valuing and preserving thermal sites.

rurAllureis a European project aimed at the promotion of rural heritage located in the vicinity of the ancient pilgrimage routes in Europe. One of its pilots is focused on the research of the thermal heritage sites along the pilgrimage route to Rome, such as Via Francigena, Romea Germanica and Romea Strata. It is therefore a true cultural mosaic that, thanks to an interactive platform, will become available to all pilgrims and hikers, who follow the route.

French food as cultural heritage and the role of locality

The cultural connection between heritage and food has gradually gained visibility over the last decades and holds an especially interesting place in today’s expanding view of cultural heritage.

The link between food and heritage has been increasingly recognised both within contemporary culture and in academia, where food studies programs have gained traction. From TV programs focused on chefs and their personal narratives to documentary series highlighting the culinary traditions of specific communities and the ingredients they use, to the enormous success of regional cookbooks and culinary blogs, we can see an emphasis leading us back to the well-known phrase: you are what you eat.

Taking France as an example, the country’s widely-celebrated cuisine has set an enduring global standard for gastronomic excellence.

While geography and a unique blend of social and economic circumstances can be partially thanked for this prestige, a special concept remains central to the success of French cuisine: the notion of terroir. Broadly put, terroir implies a connection between taste and place, resulting in a distinct local product, such as cheese or wine.

Interestingly, the traditional production practices of people in particular regions are often seen as equally important in giving a particular quality to a product. Today, the word terroir is applied to numerous products and is often used in marketing strategies and safeguarding measures for culinary heritage alike. But how did the mythology surrounding terroir become so pervasive?

Through examining a wealth of posters, advertisements, and photographs, considered alongside publications like tourism guides and maps, we can trace a visual link between locations and specific culinary products in France. Focusing on the late 19th and early 20th centuries, we can see influencing factors such as war, the rise of train and automobile transport and tourism, and the further expansion of urban life and commercial activity, all coming together to reinforce the allure of nature and rural life.

Simultaneously, the development of certification labels protecting product origins, such as theappellation d’origine controlée(AOC) for wines, juridically reinforced the sanctity of place-product relationships. This has a significant impact both culturally and economically for regional products. Even before the AOC system was officially established in 1935, we can see the importance of locality highlighted.

For instance, take the early 20th century poster for 'Fine Champagne' above, a type of cognac blend. In small red print, the advertisement assures that the local mayor of Saint-Même has certified that the vines used to produce this beverage are owned and situated within the commune. An image rich for analysis, we also see a finely-dressed woman gesturing not only to the name of the eau-de-vie, but also to the scene beyond, comprised of a vineyard, labourers calmly tending to the vines, and the owner’s chateau situated amongst the rolling hills in the background. Here we see a rural idyll, suggesting harmony between man and nature, resulting in a unique, location-bound product.

The mythical qualities surrounding regional products also involve the land and the people who work it. For instance, thevigneron, or winemaker, is often seen as a sort of translator or medium between the land and the product.

In advertisements,  photographs, and culinary festivities, historic garments or equipment may be used to convey an air of tradition and authenticity. In connection with terroir, local products are thought to reflect a typical quality ortypicitéof a region. This association can encompass the inhabitants of a place as well.

Here we see a woman serving samples in a traditional bonnet and apron for a wine festival in Dijon, part of Burgundy’s Côte-d'Or. While the outfits may serve as a marketing device, they also allow locals to perpetuate a sense of cultural continuity. Living elements of intangible heritage are often maintained through festivals and celebrations. This photo is particularly interesting because, since 2015, parts of the wine region of Burgundy surrounding Dijon were grantedUNESCO heritage status.

Echoing literary trends, the wake of industrialisation and booming urban development of the 19th century left citizens of the French capital longing for the countryside and simpler times.

Food advertisements often seized upon this new pastoralism, featuring the land, scenes of romanticised rural life, and gendered labour. For instance, this poster for olive oil from Nice (1890) displays two illustrative vignettes, enticing consumers with an idealised narrative of oil production in southern France. Above, we see an olive grove, the terrain appearing hardly cultivated, suggesting a symbiotic unity between the people and the land. Women stoop to peacefully gather olives which a young boy has shaken loose from the trees above. Behind them we see their village, with distant rocky hills, perhaps approaching the coast. Below, we are shown the production process; two men are casually working the oil press, barefoot.

Importantly, this poster was printed and distributed in Paris, hinting at the target consumers who are being sold the myth of rural Southern France, tempting them to buy a product which can figuratively transport them to another part of the country, the local 'exotic'.

The tendency to emphasise, even caricaturise a rural ideal of both people and traditions creates a complex tension in marketing and safeguarding ‘products of terroir’. While traditional garments, practices, and festivals may all be important aspects of a local culture associated with a culinary product (such as wine harvest festivals), the use of these motifs in advertising can add a reductive connotation to rural lifestyles and foodways.

Thus, imagery of celebrated food products, which may be emblematic for certain regions of France, often rely on essentialising both the food and the artisan. Some associations, like oysters with Northern France, pretzels from Alsace, or mustard from Dijon are almost reflexive for modern consumers.

The land (or the sea in the case of 'Gaufrettes Normandes' and 'La Boulonnaise') plays a prominent role in communicating the link between product and place. Before the arrival of widespread automobile tourism, these products were intended to be preserved and transported, bringing the taste of terroir directly to the market stall or kitchen table.

Many of these images play upon the idea of transportability. In the market photograph, we see the regions of the oysters clearly marked, and the words 'livraison à domicile'. The advertisement for shipping crates offers to deliver fresh oysters across Europe. Set along the seaside, a well-dressed couple samples huîtres (oysters) directly from the vendor, continuing to underline locality. We also see that the workers, servers or sellers are used to suggest authenticity or local flavour, adding appeal to the cosmopolitan consumer.

The urban food market offers an interesting reversal of the concept of locality, as it provides a gathering place where all regional products can be found together. This marketing of the specific locations as ‘exotic’ is still present in the promotion of regional products today, where terroir remains as a powerful association with heritage and quality. The example of France allows us to notice similar motifs among late 19th and early 20th century European food and drink marketing, and to see how the return of the local appears today in both food advertisements and culinary heritage initiatives.

How the naval uniform became nautical style

The unmistakable design features that make sailor suits so recognisable come directly from actual naval uniforms. These uniforms, in their most traditional form, were worn by enlisted seamen in the navy and other government-funded sea services. The suit’s first use was ceremonial and, in England, it was also known as 'Number One' uniform, taking this name from the old working rigs of British Royal Navy sailors.

The sailor suit moved from being a uniform to a fashion trend in England during Victorian times, and started as a school or sport uniform for children. In 1846, during a cruise off the Channel Islands, Queen Victoria was delighted by the sight of her four-year-old son Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, wearing a scaled-down version of the sailor suit of the Royal British Navy.

She ordered his portrait to be taken, right at the same time when the British Navy was the most powerful naval force in the world and its uniform had recently been standardised. The portrait, as well as a series of engravings, made the sailor suit very popular among the British public. Later, it was introduced as a normal outfit for both boys and girls all over the world, with some variations according to the different nations, related to the specific naval uniform of each country.

In the 1880s, advertisers began marketing sailor suits as fashionable garments. For boys, this consisted of a middy top (a loosely fitting blouse with a collar similar to the one found in sailors' uniforms) with shorts or long trousers, while girls would wear the top with a pleated skirt. Both models had typical marine designs: stars, anchors or eagles, sewn on as badges. Ready-made or sewn at home, they closely resembled actual naval uniforms and would change together with the development of the official ones. They were usually made of washable, sturdy fabrics like wool and allowed relative freedom of movement.

Sailor suits were frequently worn as school uniforms, probably due to their neatness, their military origins and their association with order and discipline. They were also adopted as sport uniforms and for leisure and a variety of social situations, not only by children, but also by adults.

The sailor suit has influenced women's fashion in more than one way.

In May 1904, Harper's Bazaar called a sailor suit 'the most serviceable all-around frock a girl can have'. Another, more directly feminine version of the sailor suit, the 'sailor dress', was popularly known in early 20th century America.

Since then, women's fashion picked it up as casual seaside wear and it became associated with sport, summer and leisure. Elements of nautical style were absorbed into adult dress, including blue and white stripes, square sailor collars and wide, loose trousers - something that fashion designers and creators still include in their work today.

How Prato in Italy became a centre for textile craft

The term ‘craft’ has the power to evoke a far-reaching, diverse universe: a universe made of traditions, family stories, techniques handed down from generation to generation, intimate memories, beautiful objects and symbols of identity.

Around the world, each territory has its own history, and specific crafts are an integral part of the history of different areas.

The history of Prato, a city not far from Florence in Tuscany,  Italy, and of the district that developed around the city is woven (pun intended!) into the textiles that started being produced there in the 12th century, when garment manufacturing was regulated by the Wool Merchants’ Guild.

After a period of political and economic decline during the 16th and 17th centuries, the production of textiles resumed in the late 18th century, and since then Prato has embarked on its fascinating route to modernity, merging centuries-old craft skills with industrial development and growth.

One of the objectives ofthe CRAFTED projectis to recover traditional crafts and the people preserving them, amplifying their voice and presenting them to a wide audience, to appreciate, protect and celebrate the efforts to keep these invaluable crafts - and the knowledge associated with them - alive.

This is whyEFHA, in collaboration withMuseo del tessuto di Pratoand thanks to the help of theUniversità degli Studi di Firenze, decided to focus on Prato for four videos part of the #craftingheritage vlog series.

For Prato, velvet is a sort of royal banner.

Since the Renaissance, its velvets have been the most admired textiles - a true element of pride for the region, where different techniques and machines were devised over the years to reach heights in the quality, garb, preciousness and desirability of the Pratese velvets.

In the first video, Honouring Tradition, Imagining the Future of Craft, the past, present and future woven in velvet are evoked by the detailed accounts by Daniela degli Innocenti, conservator and curator of the Museo del Tessuto, whose extensive collection of velvets are able to unveil stories (and secrets!) of European aristocracy. The fascination with the Past seems vivid in the words of Ivo Vignali, head of the Rifinizone Vignali, who recalls how contemporary practice is always inspired by the crafting techniques and methodologies developed over time, allowing manufacturers to craft objects of timeless charm.

Prato and its Velvets. Honouring Tradition, Imagining the Future of Craft.

From textiles to embroidery, threads are pulled together by Franca Verteramo, the passionate protagonist of the second episodeEmbroidering Memories: Minds, Hearts and Hands Enriching the Future of Fashion.

Trained as an amateur embroiderer by her mother and aunts since she was very young, Franca grew to become a professional embroiderer praised by fashion designers and artists as Mary J. Blige and Shakira, for whom she embroidered the iconic outfits she wore for the Super Bowl. Her passion for what she does leads her to always experiment with different materials and techniques, combining a traditional skill set acquired as part of her upbringing with the fantastical and luxurious ideas of fashion designers such as Roberto Cavalli and Peter Dundas.

Embroidering Memories. Minds, Hearts and Hands Enriching the Future of Fashion.

In the third episodeCreatività filata - Creative Threads. Textile Tradition and Machines: Poetics of the Future, Luigi Ricceri, from Lanificio Luigi Ricceri, talks about how tradition drives innovation in his textile factory, where study and knowledge combine with the poetics and possibilities offered by nature.

Answering the complicated question: how can machines help create a future for craft? Mr Ricceri shows how nature and tradition are applied to technical tools to produce objects able to bridge past and present, demonstrating how craft can evolve: thanks to the hands and minds of those who know it and care for its future.

Answering the question - and preserving artefacts that show how modernity was, indeed, crafted through textiles made with machines - is also one of the missions of the Museo del Tessuto di Prato, as explained by Laura Fiesoli, responsible for the contemporary collection of the museum.

Creative Threads. Textile Tradition and Machines: Poetics of the Future.

The last episode, Tessereil futuro di Prato - Weaving the future of Prato. Preserving and Passing on the Savoir Faire of the Textile Districtsees Emanuele Lucchesi, of the Marco Lucchesi Srl "Vivere In Tessuto" factory, reflect on the current meaning of creativity: creativity, for him, is making something special, something ‘important’.

Making is thinking, and craft results from the collaboration of hands and minds, whose harmony produces beautiful and meaningful objects. Both Lucchesi and Margherita Tufarelli, researcher in the Department of Architecture of the Università degli studi di Firenze, state clearly how the savoir-faire of the textile district can only survive if younger generations understand its value and vital role in the local community and society at large.

Weaving the future of Prato. Preserving and Passing on the Savoir Faire of the Textile District.

The four episodes illustrate the rich heritage, creativity, commitment and passion for the craftsmanship of Prato and its people - testimonies to listen to, learn from, and treasure forever.

Environmental action in Ireland

In the late 1960s, the Irish government proposed to build the first nuclear power plant in Ireland.

It was planned to be built at Carnsore Point, a headland in County Wexford in the very southeast corner of the country. Originally drawn up in 1968, the plans proposed building four nuclear power stations during the 1970s. Following the global oil crisis in 1973, the plans were given renewed effort. However, due to changes in government, it was not until 1977 that the plans were being put into action.

By that time, the tide of public opinion had begun to shift against nuclear power. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, public opposition to the plans grew. Anti-nuclear groups were established across the country.

A series of rallies and concerts were held at Carnsore Point to protest the plans. Thousands of people attended these free festivals.

The first large-scale concert was held between 18 and 20 August 1978 with several more taking place up to August 1981. The first concert was known as 'Get to the Point' with the second in 1979 called 'Back to the Point'.

The concerts featured popular folk and rock musicians and groups, such as traditional singer Christy Moore, Clannad, Donal Lunny and even U2, then still a young band from Dublin. Also on the bill were politicians and activists including Petra Kelly, the founder of the Green Party in Germany.

The concerts called into question the idea that Ireland needed nuclear power. They brought public attention to environmental issues at a time when these were not as much a part of public discourse as they are now. For many, it was their first time taking part in a political or environmental protest.

In the 1980s, Irish governments, seeing the widespread public opposition, quietly dropped the plans for nuclear power stations at Carnsore Point. In 1999, electricity produced by nuclear fission was banned in Ireland - meaning that there are no nuclear power plants in the country. Carnsore Point today is the site of a wind-farm, which opened in the early 2000s.

Performance practice with pedigree

Unwritten rules

Dream teams

Castells in Catalonia

A global story

'Strength, balance, courage and good judgement'

'Strength, balance, courage and good judgement' is the motto of the human towers or 'castells' typical of Catalonia, Spain. These words stem from the choral composition Els Xiquets de Valls, written by Josep Anselm Clavé in 1867. As a slogan, they sum up the vital ingredients needed for successfully building constructions of people ('castellers'). But there's something else at the heart of the tradition: community spirit.

In this blog, we zoom in on this extraordinary practice that serves as a prime example ofintangible cultural heritage.

Castells are human constructions, six to ten people high, that can occasionally be spotted in cities and town squares in Catalonia. Having originated at the end of the 18th century in theCamp de Tarragonaarea, they have spread all across the region - and beyond.

Catalonian towns often boast their very own castellers teams, who not only perform on public squares or - occasionally - inside large buildings, but also go beyond city limits to appear at dedicated events. Yet their performances can't be considered a competition. Teams mainly aim at pushing their own limits and achieving new challenges. Competitions such as the biennial 'Castells de Tarragona' are actually quite exceptional.

Should you ever have the opportunity to attend acastellersperformance, it is good to know how it works. There are some basic elements and customs to grasp, even though you won't find 'Rules of Human Towers' published anywhere:castellsare built according to unwritten conventions, known and accepted by everyone.

Usually three teams participate in a performance - although this can vary depending on the importance of the day. Each of these groups constructs three human towers and a farewell pillar. Their castells are named according to the number of castellers per level and the number of levels, for example, '4 out of 9' (a castle consisting of 9 levels with four people each). A minimum of 6 levels is needed for a structure to be considered a castle. The exception is the pillar, which can contain 4 levels.

Each part of the tower (as well as the people constituting it), has its specific terminology. First of all, there's the base, supporting the structure of the castle. Next is the trunk, crowned at its very top by a dome. In higher castles, the base may be followed by a cover or auxiliary base and shackles or extra base as a reinforcement of the structure.

At the very top stands the crowner. When they raise their arm, the tower is considered complete and the audience rewards the achievement with enthusiastic applause!

To achieve this success, every element of construction is intensely rehearsed. And eachcastellerhas a specific place and role in the tower with children - protected by safety helmets - often forming the top layers.

The lower in the tower, the more difficult it becomes to observe how the construction is unfolding. Therefore, music is an indispensable tool for castellers, indicating the stage of the construction effort. Typical instruments involved in creating such a soundtrack, include thegralla(a traditional Catalan wind instrument) and the drums.

When a castle collapses, it is said that 'it makes firewood'. Though it looks daunting, there is no reason to panic! Castellers train to succeed but also to fail. They learn how to manage falls and reduce injuries.

The ultimate success of thecastellersis not the finished tower, but its controlled dismantlement. Only when acastellis deconstructed without fails or falls, teams will celebrate and congratulate one another.

The team aspect of the art of thecastellersgoes far beyond the actual performance.

Teams reflect the communities in which they are embedded, counting any number of members from a hundred up to a thousand! Each team has a leader, who manages a group of people of a wide range of builds, skills and ages. Although women did not join in massively until the 1980s, today they make up a large part of a typicalcastellersteam.

The name of the teams usually refers to their place of origin, for example Xiquets de Valls, Marrecs de Salt, Castellers de Barcelona. Furthermore, teams are recognisable by their costume.

These outfits boast a long tradition too. An important part of a team's identity is its shirt in a proprietary colour, often red, blue or green. To avoid confusion, teams often use different shades as if it were a Pantone chart.

To go with the shirt,castellershave white trousers, a black waist sash and a red polka dot bandana that has several functions, such as protecting the wrists of the members who are in the lower part of the castle, keeping hair out of the way or offering protection to the head on sunny days. Chest badges are the finishing touch, reinforcing the team's identity.

Nowadays, there are 104castellersteams in Catalonia. They raise around 10,000 human towers a year, mainly between the midsummer feast of Sant Joan (24 June) and the Day of Santa Úrsula (first Sunday after 21 October). Often, they mark unique ceremonies or celebrations, such as the tribute to artist Salvador Dalí - an avid enthusiast of castellers - organised by his hometown Figueres in 1961.

In the north of Catalonia and more specifically in the city of Girona - location of the archive from which this blog's images were taken - constructingcastellsis a rather recent practice. Historical pictures do document, however, that throughout the 20th century, teams from outside of the city have visited Girona to perform at public festivities.

Since 1997, the city of Girona has its very own team, Marrecs de Salt. It has since become a tradition for them to raise human towers during local events, especially at the occasion of theSant Narcís Fair, the last week of October.

The practice of building human towers is not exclusive to Catalonia, though. Teams often travel abroad to demonstrate their skills. There are also castellers teams in other countries, such as theCastellers of París(France),Castellers of London(UK),Xiquets of Copenhagen(Denmark),Xiquets of Hangzhou(China) or theKoales of Melbourne(Australia).

In 2010, UNESCO approved the inclusion ofcastellersin its Representative List of Intangible Heritage of Humanity.

In this way, human towers acquired a universal status and gained the highest possible recognition as an element of popular culture. With this validation, the underlying meaning and importance of thecastellers' art has gained worldwide recognition. Mixing modernity and tradition,castellerstransmit universal values such as teamwork, solidarity and self-improvement. Participants share a strong sense of being part of the community. Therefore,castellerassociations are of great importance for the inclusion and integration of people of all ages, origins, races and social status.

On air and on the move: radio stories

Radio was the first form of media to be used as a worldwide communication network for the masses. Today, despite TV and the internet, radio remains ever-present in daily life. Rob, Dennis and Martin, volunteers at Sound & Vision and passionate radio-makers, tell us about the craft and art of radio during its analogue years.

The beginnings of radio can be seen as a precursor of social media and the ‘Do It Yourself’ movement. In fact,  the earliest radios were made by a group of innovation enthusiasts in their homes or other informal settings. It enabled sharing news, information, and stories thereby becoming one the first social networks with an ever growing number of followers. Radio was not only bringing news told by human voices to homes, crossing cities and borders. It also brought people together, either as listeners or as builders and modifiers of radios themselves. Rob de Bie, volunteer at Sound & Vision, talks about how early radios were made and why they were so popular among the masses.

Early Radios: from the kitchen table to mass production

Did you know that radio engineers were the ears deciding how the masses would hear the news? Not only were they available 24/7 for the most pressing stories, but they also added flavour to how we received and perceived soundwaves on a daily basis. They controlled the sound quality of the programmes and the emotions generated by the sonic atmosphere. Martin Schuurmans is a retired radio engineer and a volunteer at Sound & Vision. In our video interview, he shares his stories and snippets from his personal archive about radio-making, the passion of a lifetime. Explore why sound engineering is technical and artistic at the same time.

The Colour of Sounds: the radio engineer

Mixing tables are the heart of radio broadcasting. This is where all the different sources including live recordings, CDs or jingles were mixed to produce one programme. Until the 1980s, mixing tables were custom-made in house by the Dutch broadcasting agencies. In our video, Dennis van Benthem, volunteer at Sound & Vision and technical service manager talks about one of his favourite objects in the collection. It is the earliest disc jockey mixing table made by a factory. It was purchased by the first commercial radio stations in the Netherlands and instantly became a hit in the radio world. Dennis is one of the few people who knows how to operate and preserve this extraordinary piece of equipment. To know more about this special DJ mixing table, watch the episode below.

What coins where used in the Middle Ages and how far they travelled

Medieval coins show us that communication through both text and image was not restricted to books in the Middle Ages. Coins were not only a measure of how much things were worth, they were capable of expressing personal and territorial identity, economic security and collective memory. They were used for buying and selling goods, calculating wealth and transmitting ideas of faith, power and authority.  Coins were a fundamental aspect of the medieval visual world, the most common set of text and image throughout the population. For most people, coins may have been the only image of political authority they were likely to see, and probably the only writing as well!

As with written language, these pieces of metal used a series of signs and symbols that validated their authority in order to transmit a message of worth, power and belonging.  They were visual statements that guaranteed that a simple piece of metal had a certain value with which one could easily exchange all types of things. Coins worked in a similar way to the seals on a charter. They represented the authority of the issuer, and whereas a charter communicated its contents by being  read out loud, the value and meaning of a coin could be understood by assessing its materiality and imagery alongside the text. Both image and text guaranteed the worth and authenticity of a coin, and being able to recognise one was just as important as being able to read the other.

Coins were emitted by rulers and were produced in mints - workshops that were usually located in cities and centres of power along rivers and frontiers, often marking where one territory began and another ended. Between the 10th and 12th centuries, counts, dukes and territorial authorities such as bishops and abbots began to emit their own coins, often representing their identity or their history, and promoting a certain sense of economic and political community.

Produced by the thousands (even millions), the value of a coin often depended on how easily it could be recognised as being official and authentic - the text and images it contained had to be clear and easily reproduced. Easy repetition was thus more important than variety. Coins with the greatest monetary value were the least subject to modification and visual innovation, so much so that kings often emitted coins based on the same model as their predecessors’ just to give  an impression of stability. The more important and the more mainstream the coin, the simpler its imagery. So, we are  more likely to find artistic innovation in coins produced by bishops, abbots and abbesses from secluded territories.

Coins could also rewrite history. The town of Sancerre in France, for example, was named after Saint Satyrus ‘Serre’, whose relics had been deposed there in the 7th century CE. In the 12th century, it was decided that the name of the city actually came from its foundation by Julius Caesar, which linked the town to the glory of the Roman Empire. This story was not true, but in order to make it convincing, a new coin was emitted with the image of a bearded head with the inscription IVLIVS CESAR on one side and a cross with the name of the local count, STEPHANVS COMES, on the other. Thus inscribed, this new coin served as an authentic historical testimony of the city’s link to the Roman Empire.

Early medieval coinage closely imitated Roman and Byzantine imperial tradition, copying old imperial models and the names of their original issuing emperors. These coins were emitted by small territorial authorities and were meant to evoke and embody imperial power. In the second half of the 8th century CE, the Carolingians developed a more standardised mint system, and a new silver coin called denarius was emitted by the king himself. The denarius was simple and distinctive: it had the royal monograms, the word REX (king), the abbreviation of the issuing mint or workshop and Christian symbols like the cross on one side and a simplified image on the other. The Carolingian denarius served as a model for the Germanpfennig, the English penny, and the Frenchdenier.

In the 13th century, with growing towns and markets, international trade became ever more far-reaching and coins from European countries, Byzantium and many Muslim states rubbed shoulders in the Mediterranean. Thedenariushad gradually lost its value, and the more long-distance the trade, the more valuable and more standardised the coin had to be in order to ensure its transfer into a wider variety of monetary systems. Highly valuable coins such as the Arabdinar, the FlorentineFlorin, and the Byzantinesoliduswere more widely recognisable and accepted. It was quite common for the text and image of these powerful coins to be imitated in territories far and wide, allowing new coins to quickly benefit from the value and authority of better known (and more stable) coins.

Authorities knew that coins could be read and interpreted by everyday people, and that they were not only an expression of identity but also great propaganda. Their circulation was thus very important, because coins could be used to recount important events: fairs, wars, incursions, coronations and deaths. 
In the 14th century, for example, France emitted theécu, depicting the king of France sitting on a gothic throne and holding a shield.  Theécuwas meant to remind whoever held the coin of the power of the monarchy. The English coin of the time was called thenoble, and it pictured a small ship bearing the king of England, reminding the holder of the naval victories that England was having in their ongoing war with France, the Hundred Years War.

Around the same time, the French crown issued a gold coin with the image of the Easter lamb, to which Edward III, King of England, responded in defiance by emitting another gold coin for its territories in Aquitaine (where most of the fighting between the French and the British was taking place) with the Plantagenet heraldic animal, the leopard.

British and French coins continued to bicker against each other until the emission of Edward III’s last coin when, in response to thefranc à cheval, which showed the French king riding into battle gallantly on horseback, Edward III emitted theguyennois, in which the King of England appears dressed up as a knight, barging in through gothic city gates.

Most of these medieval coins nowadays are found in hoards - groups of coins or other objects that were once deposited together and concealed for safety, in hopes that the owner would one day be able to come back and recover them, an event that could happen in times of great strife, such as plagues or wars. These findings give us snapshots into what coins were used in the Middle Ages, as well as how far they travelled, not only for trade but as tokens of identity and memory, bearing the image of one’s ruler, one’s country and one’s community.

How did sports and rules evolve at the 1920 Olympic Games?

How was life in 1920s Europe reflected at the 1920 Olympic Games?

What was the impact of World War I on the 1920 Olympic Games?

The Olympic Games - the biggest sports contest in the world - have always drawn international interest and attention. Countless stories can be told about the Olympics - of competition and championship, and also of politics and identities.

The Olympic Games are thus a vital part of history. Let's travel back in time to the 1920 Olympic Games, and learn the daily life of European citizens and the aftermath of World War I in the early 1920s.

Travelling back a century in time, things were of course very different in the summer of 1920.

There were, for example, several disciplines included in the 1920 Olympic Games that no longer take place today, such as tug of war and equestrian vaulting.

An interesting surprise was the inclusion ofartas a separate discipline in the agenda. Like the athletes participating in the Games, architects, painters, sculptors, and musicians also had the chance to receive medals with their sport-inspired artworks.

Nowadays, we are used to having theSummer and Winter Olympicsas two separate sports tournaments. But, in 1920, ice hockey and figure skating were also included in the Antwerp Olympics alongside all the other summer sports.

Taking place at the Ice Palace of Antwerp, the ice hockey tournament marked the debut of the sport in the Olympics. It was also the only time this winter sport appeared in a Summer Games -  since 1924, it has been part of the Winter Games.

We also see several rule changes relating to gender. Racewalking, for instance, used to be reserved only for male athletes. It was not until 1992 that women were allowed to participate in this sport.

While sports rules have often changed, the life of European people in 1920s sees many similarities with our activities today.

Just like today, the 1920s European public were also highly passionate aboutfootball. The final match of the 1920 Olympics football tournament, in which Czechoslovakia played against host-country Belgium, attracted no less than 50,000 spectators. Some of whom - failing to burst through the sea of people - were even watching from outside the stadium.

We also know that drama and controversies are by no means something recent in football history. Violent collision between players, and dissatisfaction with referee decisions, were as major a part of football as they are today.

During the 1920 Olympics, the Swedish team nearly withdrew from the tournament in protest at the referee of their match against the Netherlands. The team from Czechoslovakia also left the field in their final match against Belgium, in opposition to a decisive penalty that caused their loss.

That Belgian national football team was initially unpopular among the Antwerp public due to the absence of players from Beerschot, the local football club. The discontent was so great that it swayed the coach’s decision, and more Beerschot players were eventually added to the field.

Just like today, football reflects national, regional and local identities and pride.

The 1920 Antwerp Olympics took place in a special historical context.World War Ihad ended just nine months before, and European countries were still struggling to rebuild their society after the destruction.

Most people at that time could not afford tickets to see these Olympic Games. Football - many fan’s favourite sport - was only the exception.

Like other cities in Belgium, Antwerp was badly damaged by the war. The decision that it would host the 1920 Games came fairly late, giving it less than a year for preparation. The rushed construction of the stadium, its incomplete state when the Games began, and debts that the organising committee had to bear... all testified to the difficulties resulting from the war.

However, World War I was also a reason why Antwerp had been chosen as the host city for the Olympics. This choice was to rewardBelgiumfor its bravery and perseverance during the war. This was reflected in the architecture of the stadium, whose entrance featured a soldier holding a grenade, instead of a traditional discus thrower.

Sports can act as a great way to learn more about history. Not only can we learn about legendary athletes and thrilling sports matches, we can also gain more knowledge of the economic, political and social life in the past.

This blog was inspired by a1920 Antwerp Olympics Source Collection on Historiana, which offers free historical content, ready to use learning activities, and innovative digital tools made by and for history educators across Europe. It is inspired by a detailed Sports Collection, created by sports history students in Mechelen, Belgium, under the guidance of sports historian Jurryt van der Vooren.

Watch a documentary celebrating a half-century of sport

GEiEG is a sporting organisation in the city of Girona, founded in 1919. The 'Grup Excursionista i Esportiu Gironí' initially aimed to promote hiking and other cultural and recreational activities. Soon, however, they began to organise sports activities for amateurs, initially linked to athletics and then to all kinds of sports. Over the last hundred years, many people have been part of the organisation at some point.

In 1971, a rugby section was created, with thousands of players being involved since then. In 2021, as part of theEuropeana Sport project, a documentary commemorating 50 years of rugby in Girona was created.

The documentary covers the half-century history of the rugby section of GEiEG while also aiming to highlight the culture of the sport by showing its intrinsic values and sharing the personal experiences of players and participants. The documentary features interviews alongside archive photographs and films. It is in Catalan, with English subtitles.

The documentary has been produced by the CRDI, the Centre for Image Research and Diffusion in Girona City Council, which holds an extensive image archive and wealth of materials reflecting different aspects of daily life in Girona and its rich cultural heritage. In 2017, GEiEG donated its collection to the Municipal Archive, with the aim of preserving it and making it accessible to the public.

The film was a collaborative process, made by CIFOG (Training Cycles of Girona). Scriptwriting, documentation and collection of photographs and videos was undertaken by members of the rugby section, in particular Jordi Mis, Xavier Mis and Ernesto Pérez. Donations made by Ramon Panosa, Agustí Esteva, Xavier Ibarzábal, Quim Planas and Jordi Mis . As a result of these donations, CRDI digitised and gathered more than 2,800 photographs and 38 videos related to rugby in Girona.

The film was first screened in October 2021 at Cinema Truffaut in Girona, as part of the Europeana Sport project, representing the culmination of a collaborative process with CRDI linking people with their cultural heritage.

Exploring the history of vermouth in Turin

Vermouth is an aperitif alcoholic drink, a fortified wine, flavoured with herbs and other botanicals. There are three general varieties: red (rosso), white (bianco) and dry.

Since the 18th century, versions of vermouth have been produced in Turin, Italy with the city becoming synonymous with the development and popularity of many vermouth brands.

Fortified wines have been made for centuries. The name 'vermouth' comes from the French pronounciation of the German wordWermut, meaning wormwood. Fortified wines containing wormwood as the main ingredient existed in Germany around the 16th century. At about this time, an Italian merchant began producing a similar product in Piedmont as a 'wormwood wine'.

Vermouth first began being produced as a product in the 18th century in Turin.

Distiller Antonio Benedetto Carpano is credited as being the first vermouth producer. In 1786, he opened a shop selling the drink which he had also produced. Vermouth soon became so popular that the shop opened 24 hours a day. Its success among the Turin aristocracy convinced Carpano to intensify production and, later, to export the drink. It also inspired other producers, who began making vermouth on an industrial-scale.

Some decades earlier, in the 1750s, two brothers - Giovanni Giacomo and Carlo Stefano Cinzano - created 'vermouth rosso' (red vermouth) which similarly became popular with the Turin aristocracy. The red version was followed by Cinzano Bianco. In the 1890s, Cinzano began exports, mainly to Argentina, Brazil and the USA. In 1913, in Paris, Cinzano was the first product to be advertised with a neon sign.

Martini is another Turin vermouth brand. It stems from the 1840s when a bottling plant was opened in a town near to Turin. In 1863, the name Martini was adopted, named after Alessandro Martini who had become the director of the company. They started exporting bottles of vermouth around the world. Martini became a very popular brand of vermouth, which remains to this day.

By the late 19th century, vermouth's popularity grew when bartenders began using it in cocktails such as the Martini, the Manhattan, the Rob Roy and the Negroni.

Many more brands existed in Turin during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Art movements of the early and mid-20th century - such as art nouveau and art deco - are reflected in the posters and labels of vermouth bottles. In Italy, vermouth producers sponsored many sports and cultural events.

Brands became popular across Europe - these examples are from museums in Austria, Belgium, Estonia, the Netherlands and Sweden.

Vermouth's popularity slowed a little in the late 20th century, although many vermouth brands associated with Turin continued to be produced. Many started as family-owned companies, and have since been amalgamated into larger corporations. In the early 21st century, new artisinal vermouth producers have begun to emerge in Turin, perhaps signalling the beginning of a new era for vermouth.

Anthropology collection exploring the art and everyday life of the Nadamurski Region

Siberia has always tempted travelers and explorers, because of its uniqueness and inaccessibility. Painful historical experiences are associated with Siberia from colonisation to wiping out of indigenous populations through genocide. Those who were exiled and forced to live there often undertook their own research on the indigenous inhabitants of this land, its fauna and flora.

The first scientific expeditions to Siberia began at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. One of these was an expedition by the Polish ethnologist and anthropologist Stanisław Poniatowski (1884-1945) to the Nadamurski Region.

Poniatowski's expedition was in line with research of the time which aimed to prove a thesis that Native Americans were of Asian origin.

According to this theory, they travelled through the Aleutian Islands and Alaska to the American continent and spread there. The expedition was sponsored by the University of Oxford, the Pennsylvania Museum, the Smithsonian Institution and the Russian Academy of Sciences.

The expedition began on 10 May 1914. Poniatowski arrived first in the village of Sakaczialan in mid-June, accompanied by eight assistants. The research covered mainly the Tunguska peoples, the peoples of Olcz, Gilak, Oroczon and Nanaj.

The lack of land communication routes, difficulties with the organisation of efficient transport and the use of mainly water routes determined that the research was mostly conducted with the population living along the Amur river.

In addition to anthropometric measurements and photographic documentation, the researchers collected information about the spiritual and material culture of the indeginous people.

This resulted in notes about the daily struggles of the Golds and Oroczons people living along the Amur river,  environmental difficulties and descriptions of beliefs, holidays, games and other manifestations of social life.

He managed to collect many objects and works of Siberian art, including embroidery stencils and ornaments, cutouts and products made of birch bark, as well as  drawings made by the inhabitants of the Sakachialan settlement.

The outbreak of World War I prevented Poniatowski from completing his research.

He left Nadamurski Region on August 8, 1914, without complete data. Some of the materials he collected were published only after many years, so the importance of the expedition was underestimated.

The collection of Stanisław Poniatowski holds a special place in the collection of the Archives of the Polish Ethnological Society.

The materials collected during the Siberian expedition were transported to Poland with great difficulty, together with the rest of the scholar's legacy. They have been preserved in good condition for over a century, despite both world wars and changes in the location of the Archives of the Polish Ethnological Society.

The Siberian collection includes photographs, photographic films and glass plates with images of the Golds and Oroczons and pictures of their everyday life.

It is unique material that is a testimony to a world and culture that no longer exists, also due to the technology used to record the expedition. The remainder are journals from the expedition that accurately describe the course of the expedition, drawings of the inhabitants of Siberia, notes and sketches of the ethnologist.

The complete collection 'Documents and photographs of Stanisław Poniatowski' consists of 7,200 objects from the years 1884-1945. It also includes materials and personal documents of the researcher, lectures, newspaper clippings, paper two-dimensional models of clothes, templates of folk patterns, samples of decorative motifs made of organic materials.

The whole collection is an important source of research for representatives of many disciplines of the humanities.

From May 30 to June 3 2022, Wrocław Transcription Week was organised. People from all over Poland, mostly from Wrocław and the University of Wrocław, have worked together to unlock the important historical documents described in this blog.

Opening the future to the dreams of the past

Throughout history, culture and art have been used as a means to discuss topics of gender and sexuality. Some artists throughout history have been part of movements to legitimise the rights of LGBTQ+ people. Painting, literature, plastic arts and other forms of artistic expression open the viewer’s mind to the multifaceted reality of an increasingly diverse community that demands human rights and acceptance

Between 1931 and 1936, Spain was governed by a republican system known as the Second Republic, which saw women gain more rights under the law and saw homosexuality taken out of the Spanish Criminal Code in 1932. For the LGBTQ+ community, the Second Republic began a period of increasing cultural awareness and intellectualism in Spain.

Federico Garcia Lorca, the famous Spanish poet who explored the taboo topics of classism and homoeroticism in his works, was killed in 1936 during the Spanish Civil War. His remains have not been found to this day.

After the Civil War, during the regime of Francisco Franco in Spain, LGBTQ+ people were viciously persecuted. Under Franco's dictatorship, homosexuality was made illegal through multiple national laws and decrees, and LGBTQ+ people were sent to internment camps, jailed, or killed.

The Spanish documentaryMama, soy gay(Mom, I'm Gay) gives an overview of the struggle for LGBTQ+ rights in Spain over the past forty years.

After Franco's death and the end of the dictatorship in 1975, homosexuality remained illegal until the government of the Kingdom of Spain overturned this law in 1979. But even during the dictatorship, countercultural LGBTQ+ scenes emerged in the 1960s in Barcelona, Sitges andIbiza.

One of the most famous examples of these underground communities during the era of oppression was ‘El Comodín’, the first nightclub and cabaret with a marked homosexual atmosphere and open to anyone from the public in Spain, opened in 1957.

In recent years, it has become a place of worship with its drag shows. It is a curious meeting and provocative reference point in the town of Sitges, located in the province of Barcelona, where the first monument against homophobia was erected in 2006.

The coastal town of Sitges is one of the most popular places for gay people because they can enjoy an atmosphere of equality in every sense.

Even though the history of LGBTQ+ rights often focuses on the struggle for equal rights for men who love men, the structural oppression of cis and trans women, lesbian women and queer women is often not highlighted as much or even minimised.

Recognition of the fierce battle that women of colour, lesbian women, queer women and trans women waged in the war for equal rights is therefore so important. It was trans women of colour and lesbian women of colour that stood on the front lines of the Stonewall riots, like Marsha P Johnson, Stormé DeLarverie, and Sylvia Rivera.

In Spain, too, the role of the lesbian community in the fight for equal rights was crucial and indispensable. The documentary 'Violet: the lesbian revolution' talks about the historical struggle of lesbian women inSpain.

This documentary episode covers the last forty years of LGBT history in Spain and focuses on the struggle of the lesbian community. It contains statements from activists who led the struggle and continue to do so today.

In 1981, an invisible enemy that decimated drug addicts and homosexuals was quietly claiming victims. To date, it is estimated that 39 million people worldwide may have lost their lives to AIDS. In the 40 years since the start of HIV infections, treatments have been developed that ensure a life quality and expectancy similar to that of the rest of the population.

The first HIV/AIDS cases in Spain were reported in 1983.

Spain had a higher prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the nineties than most other European countries. In 1997, Spain's cases amounted to a quarter of the HIV infected population of Western Europe at the time. These days, Spain has relatively as many seropositive people as other national averages.

The documentary covers the last forty years of LGBTQ+ history in Spain and focuses on the impact that the AIDS had in Spain and still has in relation to the gay community, as well as the advances in healthcare to treat HIV patients. It contains first-hand accounts from various people who offer their opinions and experiences of the illness.

In 1988, homosexual unions were recognised through civil partnerships in Catalonia, and in 2001, de facto same-sex unions were approved in Madrid.

In the following years, Andalusia, Extremadura and Madrid have continued to add rights for the LGBTQ+ community against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

On 21/11/1995, lesbians and homosexuals hijacked the Civil Registry of Madrid because they wanted to get married and consolidate the rights that already existed in society. The documentary includes testimonies of activists and politicians who made the legislative advances possible.

Spain has been recognised as a country at the forefront of LGBTQ+ rights. It is the third country in the world with the most citizens in favour of same-sex marriage, as well as defending their right to adoption.

Gaining a spot in this society has never been easy for minoritised groups of people, and current generations know that they are, with their refreshing strength, the ones who are opening the future to the dreams of the past.

Ground-breaking sexuality research

Later life & legacy

German doctor who was one of the earliest LGBTQ+ rights activists

Magnus Hirschfield was a German Jewish physician and sexologist, considered to be one of the first pioneers of LGBT rights in the early 20th century. His work at the Institute for Sexology was influential and ground-breaking.

Hirschfeld was born in the Prussian town Kolberg (now Kołobrzeg, Poland) in 1868. His father was a prominent Jewish doctor in the town. Hirschfeld studied medicine in Strasbourg, Munich, Heidelberg and Berlin.

After his studies, Hirschfeld traveled to the USA for eight months. There, he wrote articles for German journals. In Chicago, he became involved in the city's gay subcultures, noticing similarities with Berlin. He developed theories that homosexuality was universal around the world.

Returning to Germany, he started a naturopathic practice in Madgeburg and eventually moved to Berlin.

Influenced by the trials of Oscar Wilde, as well as gay patients he treated, in 1896, under a pseudonym, he publishedSappho and Socrates- a pamphlet about homosexual love.

A year later, with Max Spohr, Franz Josef von Bülow, and Eduard Oberg, Hirschfeld established the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee. It was the world's first LGBTQ+ rights organisation, aiming to repeal Paragraph 175, the law that criminalised homosexuality in Germany. The committee organised a petition, gathering 6000 signatures from prominent Germans.

The bill was brought before the Reichstag in 1898, but was only supported by a minority of law-makers. It was re-introduced in the 1920s, making progress, but was ultimately not passed.

In the early 1900s, Hirschfeld published widely and became involved in the German feminist movement, as well as being an influential figure in social debates of the time.

Unlike some of his colleagues and contemporaries, he did not believe in forcibly 'outing' people. However, in 1907, he was called to testify as a expert witness in a trial, relating to a widely publicised sex scandal. Army general Kuno von Moltke sued a journalist for libel for asserting that Moltke was gay and having an affair with politically powerful Prince Philipp von Eulenburg. Hirschfeld testified that Moltke was gay, and that this was natural and nothing wrong. However, instead of making Germans more sympathetic to homosexuality as Hirscheld hoped, his testimony caused a homophobic and anti-Semitic backlash.

Hirschfeld's position that homosexuality was normal and natural made him a highly controversial figure at the time. As a Jewish gay man, Hirschfeld was very aware that many Germans did not consider him to be a 'proper' German, or even truly German, particularly during World War I.

In 1919, during the Weimar Republic, Hirschfeld opened the Institute of Sexual Research (Institut für Sexualwissenschaft), which became a ground-breaking organisation for sexuality and gender studies.

At the Institute, Hirschfeld developed a theory of sexual intermediacy. This was a form of classification, which proposed that every human trait existed on a scale from masculine to feminine. Masculine traits were characterised as dominant and active while feminine traits were passive and perceptive. The theory places homosexuality within a broad spectrum comprising heterosexuality, bisexuality, transgenderism and transvestism (a word invented by Hirschfeld).

Also in 1919, Hirscheld co-wrote and starred in a filmAnders als die Andern('Different From the Others').

The film tells the story of two men, a musician and violin teacher, who fall in love. The relationship is discovered and the couple is blackmailed. Hirschfeld played a doctor visited by the characters, who discusses homosexuality and gender identity, explaining that sexuality is physically determined rather than a mental condition.

A role in the film was played by Karl Giese. He was an archivist and museum curator, employed in the Institute of Sexual Research. He later became Hirschfeld's life partner, living together on the second floor of the Institution. When Magnus Hirschfeld went on a on world tour in the early 1930s, he appointed Giese to run the Institute. In 1932, Karl Giese went to meet Hirschfeld in Paris. By then, Hirscheld was involved with another partner, Li Shiu Tong, a Chinese medical student. The three men lived together in a relationship described as a ménage à trois, what we may today describe as a throuple.

Being Jewish and a gay man, as well as an activist for sexual freedom, Hirschfeld was a target of right-wing supporters and conserative Catholic and Protestant groups. He suffered serious injuries during an attack in 1920. Later in the 1920s and 1930s, with the growing power of the Nazi party, he was regularly assaulted and his lectures were disrupted.

When the Nazi party came to power in 1933, Hirschfeld was already on an international speaking tour. He was unable to return to Germany, as the Institute for Sexual Science set on fire by Nazi soldiers.

Thousands of medical records, publications, photos and artifacts were destroyed. Materials were also confiscated to be used as evidence against gender and sexually non-conforming people in Germany. Between 1933 and 1945, Germany arrested around 100,000 men for being homosexual. Most of these men were imprisoned. Between 5,000 and 6,000 were sent to Nazi concentration camps, with around 60% of these being killed.

Hirschfeld first moved to Switzerland and later to the south of France. He died in Nice in 1935, two years after the Nazi party had taken power. Karl Giese, who was then living in Vienna, attended his funeral. Giese - who later moved to Brno after the Nazi annexation of Austria - took his own life in 1938. Li Shiu Tong moved to Switzerland, and eventually, in the 1970s, moved to Canada where he lived until he died in 1993.

In his will, Hirschfeld made both Karl Geise and Li Shiu Tong as his heirs, stipulating that both men should use their inheritances to advance sexual science.

Despite Hirschfeld's pioneering research, male same-sex relations were not decriminalised in Germany (East and West) until the late 1960s, decades after his death.

Hirschfeld has been commemorated by a number of LGBTQ+ organisations and community centres in several countries. Ireland's first gay community centre, established in Dublin in 1979, was named the Hirschfeld centre. In 1983, the Magnus Hirscheld Center opened in Hamburg, an association and meeting place giving advice to the queer community.

Since 1990, the German Society for Social-Scientific Sexuality Research has awarded the Magnus Hirschfeld Medal for outstanding contributions to scientific research into sex and sexuality in two categories.

Raising money for amateur athletes in the early 20th century

The Olympic Games in 1916 were due to be held in Berlin, but ultimately never took place because of the outbreak of World War I. This book is part of a failed British fundraising appeal for those games - and, somewhat counterintuitively, one of the most influential 20th century sport books published in Britain.

In the early 20th century, the ethos in British sport was one of sportsmanship, fair play, playing for the love of the game and the cult of the amateur.

This was exemplified by the London football team Corinthian F.C. who gave us the phrase the Corinthian Spirit and took the ideal of sportsmanship to what now seem like extremes. If Corinthian F.C. broke the gentleman’s code of sportsmanship by fouling the opposition and giving them a penalty, their goalkeeper would stand to one side and give the opposition a free shot at goal. If they were awarded a penalty, the Corinthian captain would deliberately kick the ball over the crossbar not wanting to take advantage of an error by the other team. How you played was as important, perhaps more important, than winning.

The 20th century would see a gradual erosion of amateurism in both British sport and the Olympics. In 1913, calling someone an amateur would be a great compliment - today it would be more likely to be taken as an insult. This publication from 1913 is an important step in that change in attitudes.

'The Olympic Games and the Duke of Westminster’s Appeal for £100,00' was a reaction to what was seen as Great Britain’s underperformance at the 1912 Summer Olympics held in Stockholm. Great Britain had ranked third in the medal table behind the United States and the hosts, winning only 10 gold medals in comparison to the United States 26 and Sweden’s 24. Immediately after the 1912 Olympics, both Sweden and America started public fundraising campaigns for the planned 1916 Berlin Olympics, hoping that they might do even better.

In August 1912, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (the creator of Sherlock Holmes) wrote a letter to The Times saying something must be done to arrest Britain’s sporting decline. 'The debate as to our preparations for the next Olympics Games tends to take the shape of recrimination rather than of construction. Might I appeal to all concerned to let bygones be bygones, and to centre our efforts upon the future? The scoring of debating points over each other only darkens counsel. The chief offender in the past has been the easy going public, which has not taken an interest until our comparative failure at Stockholm came to awaken it out of its indifference.'

Doyle’s appeal for a united front and a change in approach led to an appeal being launched in 1913.

It was led by Hugh Grosvenor, the Duke of Westminster and the wealthiest man in Britain at that time. Doyle was appointed as a member of the appeal’s committee. This book was published andsold at threepence a copy to benefit the appeal. The appeal aimed to raise £100,000 (the equivalent of £10 million today) to help with preparations for the Berlin Olympics.

The book analyses the reasons for Britain’s lack of success at recent Olympic Games. It suggests reforming the bodies that administer British sport, proposes that coaching schemes should be established, and that funding should be available for elite athletes. It combines this with a legacy element that would encourage participation in sport and fund sport facilities for the general public.

Over a century later this is still broadly Britain’s approach to sports funding.

While money flowed into the Swedish and American Olympic appeals, the Duke of 5Westminster’s appeal was a failure. The appeal was attacked in the press for being a threat to the amateur ethos which was not just central to British sport but to how the British viewed themselves. It was also seen as being overly focused on a few elite athletes rather than more broadly benefiting sport. Sporting success was seen by many as being the result of a combination of natural ability and good character. Coaching and preparation were viewed almost as bordering on cheating - it was more sporting to just turn up and take part.

The British sporting establishment of 1913 was listening though and signed up to the need for reforms in how sport was administered. It was hoped Britain would be in much better sporting shape for 1916 in Berlin and certainly for the 1920 Olympics.

British sport had a similar crisis of confidence in the aftermath of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics when the country won just one gold medal and finished in 36th place in the medal table. This led to changes in how sport was developed in Britain and, crucially, introduced National Lottery funding for elite sports in 1997. This paved the way for the success of Team GB at the London Olympics in 2012, Rio in 2016 and the delayed Tokyo Olympics in 2021.

The seeds of this success though arguably lie in this curious little book and the failed appeal for the Olympics that never took place in Berlin in 1916, and how it changed the way Britain plans for and views major sporting events.

'King of trains, train of kings'

The Orient Express is a lavishly designed train which crossed Europe linking West to  East. Its route also covers the history of 19th and 20th century Europe, travelling via these era's aspirations for independence and the emergence of nation states.

The best opportunity to realise the idea of the Orient Express came in the last decades of the 19th century, when the weakening of the Ottoman Empire led to a surge in independence aspirations in the Balkan countries which it had occupied. The desired rail link between Paris and Constantinople (today's Istanbul) was, of course, largely due to the interest of Western European countries in Eastern  Europe, as the word Orient in its name suggests.

The construction of the east-west railway line across Europe was realised by a Belgian banker, Georges Nagelmackers. In 1873, he established the first European dining car and sleeping car company, the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits. The railway company's reputation was enhanced by the fact that the King of Belgium, who was also the main shareholder in the train company, gave his blessing to the use of the royal lion emblem on the sides of the carriages.

Nagelmackers bought the most modern carriages of the time. Known as bogie carriages, they were equipped with all the comforts and splendour of the time. His idea was to give rail travellers the luxury of a journey in the same conditions as if they were staying in a comfortable hotel.

However, it wasn't just the interiors that made train travel a luxurious experience: the bogie carriages did not shake as much as other less modern trains, which ensured that men didn't have to worry about cutting themselves during shaving and ladies didn't have to worry about their lunch ending up on their clothes.

The Orient was a true luxury train, for which only first class tickets were available at the time. Monogrammed leather chairs and shiny, ornate copperware awaited passengers with fat wallets. Not only was the Orient Express's design excellent, but so were the staff. First in rank was the chef de train, who was practically in charge of everything on the train, followed by the conductors of the carriages, who wore peaked caps, gold-fringed uniforms and shiny boots.

The first direct rail link between Western Europe and Constantinople was established in 1889, on a Budapest-Belgrade-Sofia route.

The period between 1889 and 1914 was the heyday of the Orient Express, with the train reaching Constantinople from the French capital in 67 hours and 35 minutes. The Orient's viable model owed much to the consistent Hungarian railway policy of the late 19th century, which paid great attention to the development of rail links with the Balkan states.

After theTrianon peace treaties, the role of the luxury train was taken over by the Simplon-Orient express, which bypassed Hungary. The train returned to its original route only in 1924, and remained on it until 1939, when World War II broke out. Service was restored in 1948 - however, after the war, the train lost its luxury status, and second-class carriages were added. The Orient last departed for Istanbul in 1977.

Many celebrities travelled on it, including Agatha Christie, who was inspired when the Orient Express was stuck in a snowstorm not far from Istanbul in 1929. It was stranded on the open track for eleven days, during which time food was purchased from nearby villages for stranded passengers. This is said to have inspired the author's novelMurder on the Orient Express, which has been adapted into numerous films.

As a travel concept, the Orient Express was able to achieve the 'impossible', as it created a lasting connection between Western and Eastern Europe, despite uncertain political situations.

Although the rolling luxury train was shattered by the world wars and the Cold War in the 20th century, the Orient is still synonymous with luxury and splendour in the public mind. Our accelerated world became the destiny of the legendary train, where the conditions of travel have become less important than the journey time.

Passages of the Bible have been recited melodically in mass since the beginnings of the Christian liturgy, in a practice that probably grew out of Jewish traditions of reciting the Torah. Musically simple and formulaic, recited texts were rarely supplied with full musical notation. Indeed, most medieval manuscripts of Bible readings for mass, known as lectionaries, contain no music whatsoever.

However, from roughly the 11th century onwards, occasional marks were inserted above specific words in some lectionaries to help clarify the melodic recitation pattern for the reader. These small signs not only allow us to reconstruct the recitation, but also give an indication of how such books were used and the priorities of those who used them.

In mass, Bible readings were mainly recited on a single note, but the final words of a phrase would be sung to a cadence, a melodic pattern to conclude a phrase. Different patterns were used to mark the end of a sentence, a question, a pause within a sentence or the end of a reading. Cadences helped the listeners to group words into phrases and thus understand the syntax, structure and meaning of the reading. Have a listen to what this would have sounded like in the following video.

The reader would have judged which cadence to use based on the punctuation in the text.  However, the cadences started several syllables before the punctuation mark. Working backwards from the punctuation mark to establish when to sing the first note of the cadence would have been awkward, so to facilitate this process, some scribes or readers added melodic signs to indicate where the cadence began. This practice became systematised in Germany from the 11th century onwards. From there, it was adopted and developed by different religious orders, including the Cistercians and Dominicans.

One relatively early example of a book that contained this form of melodic notation is a Gospel lectionary pictured above, copied in the early decades of the 12th century, for the Church of the Holy Cross (Kreuzkirche) in Hildesheim, Germany (Hildesheim, Dombibliothek, MS 688e).  At some point in the mid-19th century, a leaf was removed (pictured below), presumably for its miniature of the crucifixion scene, from between the Gospel readings for Passion Sunday and Palm Sunday. A stub of parchment is just visible where the leaf was excised. The fragment, missing the first five lines of text, was eventually acquired by John and Trudy Hunt, founders of the Hunt Museum in Limerick, Ireland, where it now resides (Ms L 006). The Passion Sunday Gospel reading is sung according to the Hunt Museum fragment in the video above.

One melodic sign can be seen in the final sentence of the Gospel for Passion Sunday, in the line of text above the miniature: shaped somewhat like a saucepan, it is positioned diagonally above the word ‘se’.

This indicated that the end of the lection was approaching and the appropriate closing melodic cadence needed to be employed. Specifically, it showed that ‘se’ was to be sung to a two-note rising pattern, D-F. From there, the melodic pattern descended to the note E on the penultimate accented syllable ‘exívit’, and then returned to conclude on F at the final accented syllable, ‘témplo’.  Significantly, no further signs were inserted, suggesting that once the reader knew where to start the cadence, it was easy to work out what the ending was.

The reverse of the fragment (pictured above) displays six further instances of a melodic cadence sign. Here they take the form of a small diagonal stroke, as seen above at demónium (line 2), meá (line 8), cognóuistis (line 10-11), similís (line 12), sermoném (line 13), and gáuisus (line 15).  While similar in appearance to the abbreviation marks used to shorten words and minimise parchment use (e.g. above ‘e’ for ‘est’, the final word of this side), it is clear that they have a different function, as they are found above words that are not abbreviated–or in the case of ‘sermonem’ (line 13), a horizontal abbreviation mark is supplied to indicate the missing ‘m’, in addition to the diagonal melodic sign indicating the start of the cadence.

Each of these marks comes shortly before the end of a sentence, which is signalled by a punctus versus, a punctuation mark that looks like a semicolon, followed by a capital letter for the next sentence. They each fall above the accented syllable of the penultimate or ante-penultimate word, and they denote the final syllable that should be sung on the normal recitation pitch (F) before descending to cadence on E. It is interesting that here the notation is employed not to indicate a new note, but rather to show that a change is imminent, marking the final recitation note prior to the new cadential note.

This system of melodic lection marks facilitated the public reading of the Bible at mass in churches, both in monastic contexts and also in secular cathedrals where a lay congregation would have been present, such as English churches following the liturgy of Salisbury Cathedral (see the Sarum Gospel lectionary above with its red melodic marks).

Without giving precise pitches, the notation marked where and how the voice should follow the melodic cadence for different types of phrase, indicating the direction of the movement by the shape of the sign. Even if not a necessity (for they were not found in every lectionary), these marks were clearly deemed to be sufficiently useful to warrant being copied. The reading of mass lections required preparation and practice - melodic lection marks removed a layer of ambiguity and assisted readers in this process of preparation.

What is the significance of these signs? Their presence provides far more information than simply when to begin each cadence. Firstly, they indicate that a manuscript was used for reading aloud. There would have been no need to mark up a book that was not used for public reading. This helps us place the object in its original context and understand its function.

Secondly, the marks are testament to a concern for correctness. If it did not matter how the Bible was recited or where the cadences were begun, there would be no need for melodic marks. Their presence demonstrates that there was a clear idea of the correct manner of performance; any deviation was inappropriate for the sacred text and would have hindered comprehension.

Finally, these melodic marks give us an idea of how much guidance the medieval reader needed. Their presence tells us that it was not straightforward to sight-read aloud, and that additional assistance was welcome. Their absence is equally revealing. In the early 12th-century Hildesheim Gospel lectionary above, only the first note of cadences was marked; presumably the reader would have been able to deduce how to conclude the phrase without further guidance. Over time the system became more sophisticated, with increasing numbers of signs inserted to specify where cadential movement should occur, as exemplified in a later 12th-century French lectionary pictured below, and even more so in the above Sarum Gospel lectionary from c. 1508. Readers seem to have become increasingly reliant on the notation, perhaps indicating a situation in which readings were sight-read with little or no practice beforehand.

Diminutive and infrequent, this specialised form of notation not only intersects with the public recitation of the Bible but also reveals the function of the books they were copied in and the concerns of those who used them.

For further details on this notation, see 'Melodic lection marks in Latin manuscripts for Mass'.

How bas-relief went from a Classical tradition to a modern aid for visually impaired people

One form of art has been almost universal throughout human history, adorning the walls of buildings and rock faces throughout the centuries: relief art. A relief sculpture is a specific type of sculpture that uses depth to add an extra dimension to a figure, a landscape, or architectural or ornamental elements. This ancient Mesopotamian relief has two human figures slightly jut out of a stone slab.

Reliefs are divided into two broad categories: high relief has some parts of the artwork partially raised from the background at a level that is equal to at least half or more of their natural shape from the background. Then there is low relief or bas-relief, where there is a less pronounced level of projection. Other techniques include mid-relief and 'stiacciato', the latter being a kind of relief where the difference between completely flat and raised parts of the artwork is barely visible, only noticeable if one would run their fingers along the piece. A fascinating example is Donatello’sMiracle of the Mule, in the first half of the fifteenth century CE.

One of the most innovative subtypes of relief is the use of bas-relief for perspective, originating during the Florentine Renaissance between the Fourteenth and Sixteenth centuries CE in Italy. Lorenzo Ghiberti’s 'Door to Paradise' on the Baptistery in Florence is a prime example of this kind of relief work.

Ghiberti's work is a technical marvel, using relief to convey depth by following a specific use of perspective. Looking up close to one of the panels reveals how this perspective relief brings the work to life.

It was based on this technique that, in 1999, the Anteros Tactile Museum at Francesco Cavazza Institute for the Blind in Bologna, Italy, was inspired to start its own bas-relief project. The museum team asked themselves: "how is it possible to make paintings accessible for visually impaired people? How is it possible to strengthen the perceptive, cognitive, and intellectual faculties of visitors who are visually impaired but also to appeal to and educate sighted users?" Both questions are important, and neither is easy to solve.

Visually impaired people can experience three-dimensional sculptures easily through touch, but this is not possible with paintings. Through a bas-relief, though, one could convey the artist's 'vision' of a two-dimensional painting in a way that could be experienced through touch.

Anteros started creating bas-reliefs for several specific paintings that the museum workers selected, as well as ones which were commissioned to them by other important museums or associations. The collection accordingly includes bas-reliefs that translate masterpieces from the medieval to the contemporary age. You can find bas-relief translations of theMona Lisafrom the original by Leonardo da Vinci as well asBirth of Venusby Sandro Botticelli andOkitaby Kitagawa Utamaro.

Translating an original painting to a bas-relief is not an automatic process. Rather, a team composed of experts in the history of art, psychology of tactile and optical perception, pedagogy, and the community of people who are blind study the original artwork. They seek to understand the style of the composition and choose details that borrow the rules of Florentine perspective spatial representation to convert into tactile values. They then create a prototype in clay, test it and, if the results are positive, reproduce it in plaster or fibreglass.

All the bas-reliefs are intentionally white. The colours of the painting can be conveyed verbally to people who became blind later in life and have prior experience of colours or can be communicated to partially sighted through enlarged photographic reproductions. This results in iconic images accessible by touch.

Through these bas-reliefs, Anteros museum has made paintings tangible and comprehensible to people who are blind. The bas-reliefs are also interesting to sighted users, allowing them to experience the beauty of art using the sense of touch they otherwise don't use in a museum. Visitors can experience the bas-reliefs on their own or be guided by blind and sighted guides. They can follow the curve of the giant wave inThe Great Wave off the Coast of Kanagawaby Hokusai, and feel how the rippling force of the water will come crashing down on the little boat down below.

This may seem like an easy task, but it's not at all. Visitors have to make an effort to concentrate and to recreate the shapes, know the different layers of the perspective composition, remember each detail, and make it their own. But the reward fully justifies the effort!  By internalizing tactile reading techniques, both blind and sighted art lovers can reach aesthetic enjoyment of the artwork in ways they couldn't before.

Using bas-relief art results in an enhanced understanding, breaks down preconceptions by changing people's attitudes, and creates a new and exciting way to perceive art, both for visually impaired and sighted people.

History and 'glorious deeds' of a defunct Scottish football team

Third Lanark Athletic Club is the most famous defunct professional football club in Scotland. Today the club’s name has an almost mystical resonance for football fans of a certain age. Founding members of the Scottish Football League in 1890 and, for a time one of the most successful clubs in Scotland, the club was liquidated in 1967. The players still on its books were put up for transfer and its assets sold off.

When this booklet came out (it is undated but was probably published in 1938) Third Lanark’s glory days largely lay in the past, although the club was still very much a going concern. The red cover is the same colour as the Third Lanark strip and ironically has the legend 'A bright future'. Judging by the opening paragraphs of this short history even back then Third Lanark had a special aura about it.

“THIRD LANARK! What romance surrounds the name! What glorious deeds the men who have worn the honoured colours have achieved. The glamour which surrounds this beloved old Club of ours has grown as the years have passed, while that of others may have diminished.

From a humble beginning the Third Lanark Club carefully watched over by men of wisdom and who have been indefatigable in their labours – a labour of love let me add – has grown to be one of the most respected and powerful in Britain. Proud traditions do we have, traditions, let me say, which will be worthily upheld in the days which face us.”*

Hyperbole perhaps, but the Club had much to be proud of since its foundation in 1872 by soldiers of the Third Lanarkshire Rifle Volunteers. They won the Scottish League Championship in 1904 and reached the Scottish Cup final five times, winning it twice.

Perhaps the most enduring tale about the club concerns the Scottish cup final in 1889 when they played Celtic in Glasgow. Snow began to fall on the morning of the match and was ankle deep by the time it came to kick-off. The teams agreed in the circumstances that they would just play a friendly and rearrange the final. The referee Charles Campbell did not agree - the fans had come to see a cup final and a cup final they would get.

Third Lanark won 3-0 but Celtic complained to the Scottish Football Association and wanted a replay because of the extreme weather conditions. After discussions it was decided the game would be replayed, much to the disgust of Third Lanark’s fans and players. However, Third Lanark won the rematch 2-1 and belatedly lifted the Scottish Cup that year.

The book is a history of the club and by default the early days of Scottish football, but it also shows how we used to write about sport. Paragraphs are headed 'Glowing tributes', 'Our fame grows', 'Plucky draw', 'Gripping struggles' and 'A valued servant'. One of the later paragraphs - headed 'Fight for survival' - is a premonition of what lay ahead. Indeed, the club’s story after the publication of this book is one that haunts the boardrooms of many football clubs today – how to run a football club as a sustainable business.

Today, a club called Third Lanark plays in the Central Scottish Amateur Football League. In the recent past it was rumoured that they might apply to join the Scottish Football League to become a professional side. So perhaps Third Lanark A.C. might once again become a force in professional Scottish football; stranger things have happened.

From Slovenian beekeepers to the United Nations

Meant to bee - the heritage of Slovenian beekeeping

Bee our guest - the rise of apitourism

Bee the change - apiculture challenges

Bee engaged!

How Slovenia helped to create World Bee Day

The 20th of May is World Bee Day, celebrated around the world since 2018. This global initiative has tried to raise public awareness about the importance of bees and other pollinators to humankind. In times when industrialization, urbanization, intensive farming, and deforestation have intensified environmental health risks, it is crucial to raise awareness of the importance of bees. The fact that around 75% of global food crops rely on animal pollination, a third on bees alone, is astounding. Imagine - every third spoonful of food in the world depends on bee pollination.

Proclaiming World Bee Day was a long three-year path in which Slovenia took the lead. The Slovenian Beekeepers’ Association launched the initiative to create a World Bee Day in 2014, and the Slovenian Government supported the initiative shortly afterward. In September 2015, one of the largest international beekeepers’ organizations, Apimondia, backed the initiative.

In the context of this initiative, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Food of Slovenia traveled around the world with a pavilion named Bee World designed especially for this occasion. The pavilion was used to actively promote and provide all the necessary information on the initiative and other related projects. Inside the pavilion, an interactive exhibition offered the visitors the unique experience of the world of bees via augmented reality and a unique audio-sensorial experience. Under the dome-shaped pavilion of hexagonal wooden elements that form a honeycomb, visitors could listen to bees buzzing inside a beehive, smell propolis and engage in many other activities, all utilizing modern virtual technology. The Ministry also held several bilateral meetings with representatives of other countries and international organizations and organized various events for experts.

On 17 November 2017, after more than three years of effort, the UN’s Economic and Financial Committee adopted a resolution proclaiming World Bee Day. On 20 December 2017, the resolution was unanimously backed by the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York, thus designating 20 May as World Bee Day.

Seeing the massive objective of World Bee Day, one might ask why Slovenia? Why take up the extensive initiative of raising the awareness of the importance of bees and beekeeping? Was there no one else to take up this role? History and tradition played a key role in Slovenia picking up the initiative.

Beekeeping is one of the most important agricultural branches in Slovenia, it has a long-standing tradition. It was first mentioned in writing in an encyclopedia written by Johann Weikhard von Valvasor in 1689 calledthe Glory of the Duchy of Carniola. The encyclopedia contains the first longer presentation of beekeeping in Carniola - the present-day central part of Slovenia. Valvasor writes that one can see special little houses for bees in this land.

Slovenia is the homeland of the Carniolan honey bee (Apis mellifera carnica), prized around the world for needing little food, producing large amounts of honey, having a great sense of orientation, and being rather docile. The excellent characteristics of the species have led to its widespread adoption; it is now the second most common honeybee in the world.

Slovenia has its own unique apiary style, their own unique painted beehive panels, A-Ž hives, honey bread biscuits and hearts, and unique apitourism. You cannot find these features anywhere else in the world. Slovenian beekeepers are respected members of society. Some are regarded as legends; Anton Janša, the pioneer of modern beekeeping and Anton Žnideršič who co-developed the A-Ž hive to name a few.

People like these laid the foundation of the extensive beekeeping heritage that we enjoy today. Through their endeavors, Slovenes have been made aware of the important role of bees in the environment, as well as the significance of apiculture in rural development and human health. Slovenian beekeepers, who are mostly united in the Slovenian Beekeepers’ Association formed in 1873, are proud to continue and preserve the tradition of their ancestors. Let’s dive into a television clip reporting from 1998 about the 125th anniversary of the Slovenian Beekeepers’ Association. In 2023 the Slovenian Beekeepers’ Association will celebrate its 150th anniversary.

Beekeeping in Slovenia is deemed as the poetry of agriculture. It is not merely keeping the bees for their honey, but so much more. It is a way of life. So, no wonder Slovenia took the lead in proclaiming World Bee Day.

Slovenian beekeepers have enhanced the beekeeping tradition with apitourism.
Apitourism is about promoting bee products, several of which have medicinal applications. In apitherapy, there are numerous possibilities of healing with honey bee products, which can be useful for treating problems such as respiratory diseases, low immunity, various other illnesses and ailments.

In apitourism a visit to a beehive is comparable to a visit to a wine cellar where instead of tasting wine one can taste honey and gastronomic treats made of honey. By participating in a workshop you can learn how to cook with honey or how to make honey dough dishes, honey bread, and pastries.

Slovenia counts more than 10.000 architecturally distinct beehives The novelty of medical apitherapy in a typical Slovenian beehive is a big part of Slovenian apitourism: visitors lie on beehives and relax during a honey massage, inhale beehive air aerosol and listen to the background sound of beehive buzz.

It is well known that beekeepers are known to be healthy, and many live to a ripe old age, retaining their physical energy and clarity of thought to the very end. Being exposed to the hive fragrance that beekeepers inhale while working or resting in the beehive is most pleasant and beneficent. Because of the free circulation of aromatic air from the hives, such bee houses produce an extremely fine microclimate which exerts a favorable effect on the human respiratory system and well-being in general.

However, Slovenian apiculture has also had its share of challenges. More than a decade ago, when many beehives in Slovenia died off in mysterious circumstances, Slovenia became one of the first nations anywhere to limit some of the most harmful types of chemicals in pesticides, in large part due to the influence of the Slovenian Beekeepers’ Association. The association suspected the culprit was a class of nicotine-like insecticides and urged Slovenia’s Ministry of Agriculture in 2011 to act. A news clip from 2008 indicates several incidents of a mass die-off of beehives throughout Slovenia, all suspecting the use of pesticides.

While the association had anecdotal evidence that neonicotinoids were killing bees, they did not have definitive proof.

The Minister of Agriculture at the time decided to trust the beekeepers’ instincts and banned the use of neonicotinoids that same year becoming one of the first European Union countries to bring in the most stringent measures.

The following news clip from 2012 reports the devastating damage to corn fields due to banned disinfection preparations for the corn seeds and the despair of the farmers.

Even though the measure predictably lowered the next year’s yield of corn, by alerting the international community Slovenia helped pave the way for other countries to restrict or completely ban bee-killing pesticides.

It was only in 2018 that the EU further expanded the ban to all field crops amid growing evidence that neonicotinoids were causing bee colonies to collapse. Still, many activists want more comprehensive restrictions. The die-offs serve as a reminder for Slovenians that a clean environment is essential for one of the country’s most precious treasures.

The challenges bees and beekeepers face are not limited to the use of harmful chemicals. Today bees, pollinators, and many other insects are declining in abundance due to a range of factors, in particular the effects of human activities, such as changes in land use, intensive agricultural practices, as well as pollution, pests, diseases, and climate change.

The Covid-19 pandemic warned us that food security is not to be taken for granted. Pollination through bees and wild pollinators provides one of the most important ecosystem services, for the operation of natural as well as agricultural ecosystems. Sure, we do want World Bee Day to be a celebration, but we don’t have a lot to celebrate right now. Let’s use this day as a tool to inform others that bees are important and do small things that will directly help to save them. One example of what you can do to help is to start a pollinator garden – a sustainable home where they can thrive.

A chat with the artisan in his workshop

The Italian basket maker Nicola Solimano is taciturn, he does not like to talk about himself very much, but at my insistence, he agreed to tell me his story over the time of weaving an object. With his skilled hands, Nico weaves vegetable fibres to give shape to different objects: cylindrical, rectangular, spiral baskets, large and small vases, trays, fruit bowls, lamps, animals, and containers of all kinds. Nico is now a master of this art, with his calloused hands he handles the branches, flexes them, intertwines them, and models them silently, seven to eight hours a day.

How did you approach the art of weaving?

I approached the art of weaving about ten years ago. I had a steady job, I was a computer scientist in a company, but I was tired of a stressful and monotonous job. One day I had a shock: seeing a documentary about a Venezuelan artisan, José Briceño, who made paper hats in a family workshop, I realised that it was time to change my life and dedicate myself to what I always had wanted: manual work. After all, I have craftsmanship in my blood, my parents were upholsterers and my grandfather was a saddler. So I made up my mind, I gave up on a secure job to have more free time and devote myself to my passion, much more rewarding for my well being. The first works were actually on paper, but then having participated in a willow and reed weaving training workshop, I fell in love with wicker and I made weaving my new profession.

What are the materials that are most congenial to you?

My favourite material is the willow branch, or to be exact thesalix viminalis, better known as "wicker" or "vinco", although sometimes I also try cane and marsh grasses such as sedge. I buy the raw material mainly in other European countries, where there are still numerous producers of willows and the value for money is better than in Italy.

For the interweaving work i use young, long, flexible and hulled and unhulled branches. Typically, willow plants are grown in humid soils and harvesting is done once a year, at the end of winter, when the plants are dormant. After harvesting, the bundled wickerwork to be peeled is put into water to germinate and then be peeled by hand or machine. After a long drying period, the branches are gathered in bundles of equal height and stored. The more flexible the wicker is, the more it is suitable for twisting. Practically there is no waste from wicker, from the residues of the branches other small objects can be created, racks, pendants, garlic containers, decorations and so on.

Do you work alone or do you collaborate with other artisans and artists?

I am a loner, I usually work seven to eight hours a day in my laboratory in Anguillara Sabazia, not far from Rome, sometimes I turn on the radio for company, but then I turn it off to find the silence necessary to seek inspiration, the right solution, the flicker of creativity. The work may seem repetitive, some objects may seem similar but in reality, infinite details make them different from each other, each new creation represents a challenge, conscience and time are needed for it. From time to time I also collaborate with other artists, such as the ceramic artist Luisa Raggi, with whom we propose creations in partnership, experimenting with  the combination of clay and wicker, giving life to contaminations and original creations that are also exhibited in art exhibitions.

Would you like to tell us about other projects you are involved in?

Once basketry, perhaps more ancient than weaving and ceramics, was a necessity: baskets, containers, and panniers were indispensable for crops, transport, conservation, building. Even today, especially in some Asian and African countries, basketry is very common and everywhere in the countryside objects of wicker and rush are used for agriculture, furnishings and everyday use.

In Europe, on the other hand, an attempt is mostly made to keep alive the memory of the forms and techniques of a millenary tradition. Unlike Germany, France and Spain, where craftsmanship is more encouraged, in Italy, there are no longer many professional basket makers. So I thought of giving life, with the collaboration of other masters active in Italy, to a project that had the aim of handing down the secrets of this millenary art, the different techniques, the use of tools, and the choice of materials, forms and traditions of use.

Thus was bornWikicesteria, a webspace specifically dedicated to the structured collection of information relating to the art of basketry, starting from the composition of a glossary of Italian local, regional and dialectal terminologies. Our project is open to anyone who wants to spread their knowledge, skills and experience in the field of basketry. Know-how is often handed down for generations, and it would be nice to be able to pass it on again through a fruitful intertwining of knowledge!

Nico is self-taught, he documented, studied, attended the courses of master basketmakers and, thanks to his great dexterity, has now become so expert that by now he is called to hold workshops throughout Italy and abroad to teach Italians and foreigners, enthusiasts and already expert basket makers.

Horticularist, gardener and collector

Edward Augustus Bowles was a horticularist and gardener with a passion for plants.

E A Bowles was born in May 1865 at Myddelton House in Enfield, a town to the north of London. This was his family's estate for more than 200 years. His ancestors were Huguenot refugees who escaped persecution in France in the 17th century. Their wealth expanded over the centuries. By the mid-19th century, they were known as philanthropic landlords and employers.

Bowles lost the sight in his right eye at age eight. He was described as being 'too delicate for public school' thus spent much of his childhood at Myddelton before attending Cambridge University reading divinity.

Bowles became a voracious collector. As a child, he began by collecting butterflies and moths. He pursued this further at Cambridge, joining the 'Bug and Tick club', later becoming a Fellow of the Royal Entomological Society.

Bowles was a keen traveller, especially to Europe and North Africa, and brought many plant specimens home with him. Following his first trip abroad, in 1890, he began to develop the garden of Myddelton House with a rock garden with alpine plants.

His great love of plants led Bowles to write about them, publishing articles and books throughout his life. His first publication was a trilogy on his garden through the seasons. He accumulated an extensive botanical and horticultural library. He was also a self-taught artist, producing paintings of plants and flowers.

In 1891, Bowles started his collection of crocuses. By 1901, he was growing 135 named species and varieties. His love for crocuses led him to write a book about their cultivation and variety, gaining him the nickname 'the crocus king'.

Bowles' encyclopaedic knowledge of plants led to him being appointed as a Vice-President of the Royal Horticultural Society and receiving the Victoria Medal of Honour, their highest award.

In old age, Bowles' vision deteriorated badly and he could no longer see plants properly. His intimate plant knowledge meant he was still able to identify many by smell and taste.

E A Bowles died in 1954. In the 1950s, he had ensured his garden would be preserved for future generations. Important plants were bequeathed to the London School of Pharmacy, with his paintings becoming part of museum collections.

While browsing the Europeana collections you might have come across one of these funny looking images, showing well-dressed folk in the early 20th century posing with machines that look strikingly similar to those you may know from fitness clubs, spas or even hospital therapy.

The resemblance is no coincidence: these machines were created by Swedish physician and orthopaedist Dr. Jonas Gustaf Vilhelm Zander, often credited as one of the originators of mechanotherapy, the treatment of disease by mechanical means.

Born in Stockholm in 1825, Zander was inspired byPer Henrik Ling’s work in gymnastics and quickly became an expert in this discipline. Zander realised that those practising gymnastics were limited by what they could do with their own bodyweight.

Using mechanics to increase the pressure and resistance on certain muscles or parts of the body opened up a whole new world of possibilities, and he began his experiments with mechanical therapy in the 1850s with a specific goal in mind: opening up therapeutic movement to people with injuries or physical disabilities. The machinery allowed people to control resistance levels,  allowing people with limited mobility to exercise nearly effortlessly. Each machine targeted a specific muscle group allowing isolation exercises. Some of them mimicked massage techniques: the machine in the following illustration was designed to massage the lower abdominal muscles.

The rapid industrialisation and mechanisation Europe went through from the turn of the 19th century brought an incredible array of new technologies, but it also led to over-populated cities, more sedentary lifestyles and an increase in epidemics.

The advent of hygienics and its particular focus on physical activity and well-being also explains why this was a time of incredible change in sports practices and technology, even though these changes at first mostly concerned people from the upper classes. One such example is the book Training of the body for games, athletics, gymnastics, and other forms of exercise, co-written in 1908 by Britishreal tennisplayer and diet guruEustace Hamilton Milesand German sports psychologistFerdinand August Schmidt.

Dr Zander, after some successful experiments, managed to open his first wellness institute in Stockholm in 1865. Similar to our modern gyms, this institute was stocked with 27 of his machines and, because it was state-supported, it was accessible to those who could not  afford to pay for such therapy.

In 1876, Zander’s machines won him a gold medal at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia and, at the same time, attracted a new and very wealthy clientele.

The next two decades saw his machines spreading around a number of exclusive private institutions and health spas around the United States, but also in other countries: by 1906, similar institutes were established in 146 different countries. They would also be exported to clients in Russia, Germany and Argentina, possibly thanks to a catalogue distributed by the Stockholm-based gymnastics equipment company “Göranssons mekaniska verkstad” from where this collection of images originates. The absence of athletic wear and lack of exertion on the people’s faces puts the emphasis on the passiveness of the activity: one only had to place oneself on the machine, and it would do all the work.

Zander's success led him to begin lecturing about remedial gymnastics at the University of Stockholm in 1880. In 1896, he became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. His death in 1920, in the aftermath of World War I and in the period leading to the Great Depression, temporarily put his machines out of everyone’s mind. That said, since the last decades of the 20th century, they have received well-deserved attention, and many of them can still be seen at theSwedish National Museum of Science and Technologyin Stockholm and theRijksmuseum Boerhaavein Leiden, the Netherlands.

A media kidnapping

The killing of Aldo Moro

The Moro kidnapping between literature and cinema

A seminal event in Italian political history

For all these reasons, dear colleagues who have announced our trial in the streets, we tell you that we will not be prosecuted...

Aldo Moro has always been considered a calm politician. Also for this reason, the words he spoke on March 9, 1977 in Parliament, during a discussion on the Lockheed scandal, caused a certain sensation. And surely many of his colleagues will have remembered them a year later, when, on the morning of March 16 1978, the news agencies began to report that the president of the Christian Democrats had been kidnapped by the Red Brigades, who had killed the five men of his escort and had taken him to the "people's prison" to subject him to a "proletarian trial".

The 55 longest days in the history of Republican Italy begin that March 16, and will end on the following 9 May, when the terrorists will leave the body of the Apulian statesman in a red Renault 4, parked in a central street in Rome.

Aldo Moro at that time was probably, together with Giulio Andreotti, the most powerful politician in the country. He is spoken about openly as the next president of the republic and precisely that March 16, the Parliament is preparing to vote for confidence in the new government led by Andreotti, a government strongly supported by Moro, against many of his own party comrades: for the first time since 1947, the Communist Party will be an integral part of the majority. There is also discontent among the communists but his kidnapping and the massacre of the men of his escort overshadow all the doubts that still hovered among the parliamentarians the evening before: the Chamber first and the Senate afterwards take very little time to vote for the confidence in the Andreotti government, in order to have an executive with full powers in what will immediately be announced as the most difficult days in the history of the Republic.

Terrorism is not an exclusively Italian phenomenon: if Spain and Ireland have to deal with separatist armed groups such as ETA and IRA, France and Germany live experiences, albeit at a lower intensity, similar to those in Italy: in France between 1979 and 1987 a group called Action Directe operated, while in Germany, the Rote Armee Fraktion, also known as the Baader-Meinhof Group, active from 1970 to 1998, just a few months before the Moro kidnapping, had kidnapped the head of the German industrialists Hanns-Martin Schleyer, kidnapping which ended dramatically with the killing of the man and the death in prison of the group's founders.

During the kidnapping, the Red Brigades tried to exploit the press, trying to transform the media into a sounding board for the communications coming from the so-called people's prison, with which they intended to update the country on the "process" they were subjecting the Christian Democratic leader to. Many newspapers questioned whether it was the case not to publish those communiqués and some did.

The first communiqué, in which the terrorists claim the kidnapping and massacre of the escort, is dated 18 March and it is accompanied by a photo of the Christian Democratic leader, proof that Moro is alive, something that some had questioned; they speak for the first time of the “SIM”, the imperialist state of multinationals and, as in the other communications, the language is twisted and you can read in filigree studies of the Marxist classics and an analysis that tries to take hold of the working class from which, however, precisely in those days, they seem sidereally distant.

This will be followed by eight other communiqués, to which the terrorists soon begin to add letters that Aldo Moro writes to his family and, above all, to the politicians on whom, he realizes, his fate partly depends on.

The political parties firmly reject any hypothesis of negotiation and mediation, with the only exceptions of the PSI and the extra-parliamentary left: they are afraid of creating a precedent, they are afraid that the citizens may not understand. Thus we arrive at 5 May when the Red Brigades send the ninth communiqué: “In words, we have nothing more to say to the DC, its government and the accomplices who support it. The only language that the servants of imperialism have shown they can understand is that of weapons, and it is with this that the proletariat is learning to speak. We, therefore, conclude the battle that began on March 16, carrying out the sentence to which Aldo Moro was convicted”.

Four hectic days of meetings and indirect messages will follow, but on 9 May the Red Brigades announce the execution of the Christian Democrat leader, giving directions to find his body in via Caetani in Rome, a few steps from the national headquarters of the Christian Democrats and the Communist Party.

What emerged clearly during the 55 days of the kidnapping was that the state was totally unprepared to handle an event of that magnitude. Terrorism was defeated a few years later, with the repentants, and because it was isolated in the country and very far from the interests of the classes it said it wanted to represent.

A few months after the killing of the Christian Democrat leader, Leonardo Sciascia, one of the greatest Italian intellectuals, wrote "The Moro Affair" an instant book on the kidnapping, thus explaining the reason that prompted him to do so:

Aldo Moro dying, despite all his historical responsibilities, acquired an innocence that makes us all guilty, even me […]. By dying, Aldo Moro stripped himself, so to speak, of his Christian Democratic tunic. His body does not belong to anyone, but his death puts us all under accusation.

Many other texts, essays and novels have been written, but it was above all cinema that tackled terrorism in general and the kidnapping and killing of Aldo Moro and his escort in particular. The first was Gianni Amelio who in 1983 directed “Colpire al cuore”, in which the “years of lead” surround a difficult relationship between a father and a son.

Many controversies welcomed, in 1986, the release of Giuseppe Ferrara's film "Il caso Moro", almost a chronicle of the days of 1978, but which evidently touched nerves still very much exposed, something of which the director was well aware, but which he boldly claimed.

On the other hand, Marco Bellocchio, who in 2003 directed 'Boungiorno, notte', completely changed the register: while not renouncing the news elements, he chooses an almost fairy tale ending, in which he imagines Aldo Moro, let escape by a terrorist from his prison, on a spring morning, who finds himself walking in a deserted Rome on the notes of the splendid 'Shine On Your Crazy Diamond' by Pink Floyd.

In conversation with contemporary artist and professor Brankica Zilovic

Brankica Zilovic (b.1974) is a visual contemporary artist and teacher who graduated from the Schools of Fine Arts of Paris and Belgrade, developing a body of work in which threads appear in a recurring manner. Embroidery and the world of textiles have gradually become associated with her practices through installations, pictorial configurations, and drawings.

In her creations, Brankica blurs the traditional boundaries established between crafts and contemporary art and carries a message of resilience. As crafting heritage is also a contemporary matter and we decided to have a talk with Brankica to learn more about the world of contemporary textile art.

First, could you explain what it means to define yourself as a textile artist, and what it means?

I see myself as a contemporary artist whose main medium is textile. I am talking here about textiles in a broad dimension. By its tangible material dimension, textile is a medium that comes first in my works. I think like a painter whose technical knowledge of textiles is a primordial medium. 
It all started with a desire of mine to extend my thinking and find a new strategy for my drawings. I progressively started to mix drawings with embroidery and painting with textile before switching to creations made entirely from textiles.

How did you learn to work with textile and what are the techniques you use?

I would say that I am self-taught, I learned to create on my own, guided by a particular necessity. I am not trained as an applied art textile designer per se.

For the techniques, I started with embroidery and then worked with hybrid techniques, using different tools (e.g. sewing machines), and different materials such as paper and beads. I have always liked to navigate between “traditional” textile techniques, such as hand tapestry, and new techniques such as wall installations. I also use concrete and books as stitches in my creations.

Embroidery is now widely deployed in my works (whether it is on canvas, paper, or even concrete) but I also work on other formats such as sculptures.  This hybridity in my technique is a way for me to blur the traditional border between crafts and contemporary art in favour of new creative formats.

Threads seem to be a cardinal material in your creations, can you explain why you use them and what is at stake?

The use of threads in my works enables me to tell what I want to tell and to create cartographies. Cartography is at the heart of my work. It allows me to narrate a part of my life, as I come from former Yugoslavia, it voices my experience and represents this trauma which is the motor of my work. Threads allow me to weave synaptic links, repair memories, to maintain the world as it is. Landscapes and cartography help me to depict the world, inside and outside, according to personal geopolitics where the intimate meets the collective.

My thought is also nourished by the thinking ofEdouard Glissantand his concept of "creolisation". We must weave our capacity to live together, and textile is a way to express this: by its elasticity, its colour, and its resistance. Threads also allow me to mix the aesthetics of erosion, overflow, and gravity with that of repair. Edouard Glissant speaks of the energy of creation as something in constant motion, and I think that textile contributes to this energy and gives new possibilities.

Although my work evokes erosion and trauma, it tends towards a kind of renewal, towards a safeguard and a repair of the world. The gesture of suturing is a gesture of repair. Each stitch in my works is proof of my existence.
Finally, I would say that thread is linked to the body. Working with thread is physical and long, there is a meditative and almost addictive slowness.

Do you feel like you are part of an artistic movement, “textile art” or “craft art”?

I think that the notion of an artistic movement is a little outdated. Today we must think of creation as an asset of several individualized practices with different streams and fluctuations. I would rather think about how textile influenced social and political movements:

In the 2000s there was a real return of the crafts, and there was a phenomenon of devitrification of certainties around mediums. Crafts were on one side and contemporary art on the other. Suddenly everything became possible, and everything could be re-evaluated again.

In the 1980s and 1990s, you could see that textiles could take on an important role in critical space. I recall that the work of Rosemarie Trockel, Ghada Amer, Annette Messager or Louise Bourgeois could, through textiles, animate and mobilize questions about gender, the values of our society, individuals, political issues, female emancipation, etc.
The use of textiles also had a political dimension. After the Second World War, women who were knitting socks started to knit slogans, during Pinochet's dictatorship in Chile or even during the AIDS crisis patchwork was used as a way to make demands.

I found it very interesting from a traditional aesthetic point of view, that textile art is know-how that values a French, European, and universal heritage. I would like to mention some textile artists such as Anni Albers, Sheila Hicks, Tracey Emin, as well as Zangewa Billie, Nicholas Hlobo, Pia Camil, Abdoulaye Konate, and El Anstsui.

But it ought to be said that some artists don't exclusively use textiles. They go back and forth with other mediums. The porosity between several mediums also makes it possible not to distinguish or marginalize creators who use textiles and to understand the notion of the contemporary artists as unique and plural.

Moving to your work as a teacher, why would you say that transmission of textile art matters?

I am the coordinator and teacher in the ExTRA (Textile Experimentation and Artistic Research) masters at The College of Art and Design of Angers, France (ESAD-TALM).
Part of the art option, the ExTRA master option allows students to specialize and strengthen the language of textiles in its theoretical and plastic dimensions, while at the same time retaining an openness to the other fields of contemporary creation. The approach to textiles in all its forms is thus constantly enriched and is intended to be permeable to other practices, which question and challenge it. The student's course is therefore part of a wide panorama of proposals that will enable them to understand the plastic, economic, ecological, ethical, and political issues at stake, as well as the human and social links, considered from the prism of creation and according to an approach in the textile field that is little explored in France, to invent and reinvent them according to their aspirations and artistic trajectories.

Although cricket is widely played and supported in Scotland, many people believe that Scottish cricket is a contradiction in terms, like a square circle or liquid ice, or a myth like the Chimera or the Loch Ness monster. This little booklet is one small piece of evidence that shows they are mistaken.

The earliest Scottish cricket clubs were established in the country in the 19th century. Perth Cricket Club has been in existence since at least 1826 and the Grange Club in Edinburgh (now the home of the Scottish national team) was founded in 1832.

Indirectly, we might have Bonnie Prince Charlie to thank for bringing cricket to Scotland. The sport was first popularised in Scotland by English troops sent to garrison towns such as Perth to suppress dissent following the 1745 Jacobite rising led by Bonnie Prince Charlie, by which time it was already established as England’s national sport. Cricket was also increasingly taken up by the Scottish gentry in imitation of their 'sophisticated' English contemporaries.

The cover of this short history of the Clackmannan County Cricket Club is an idealised image of the game, reminiscent of illustrations from boy’s story papers of the period. It was not unique to this publication and was used as the cover for many similar short histories of Scottish cricket clubs produced by Dundee-based publisher D.C. Thomson.

Clackmannan County Cricket Club was founded in 1868 and is based in the town of Alloa in the central lowlands of Scotland. The town is almost exactly equidistant from Scotland's two largest cities Glasgow and Edinburgh. Alloa is known for being a centre of the brewing industry and is also the home of Alloa Athletic Football Club.

According to the handbook, cricket was played in Alloa as far back as the 1850s, although later historians have found evidence of cricket being played in the town as early as 1785. By the 1880s, Clackmannan County Cricket Club was successful enough to engage professional players, including some from Yorkshire, the great cricketing county in England. In 1925 when the handbook was published, Alloa born Thomas Alexander Bowie (1877-1974) was captain of the club. He played with Clackmannan County for almost thirty years, scoring at least eight centuries. He also played for Scotland scoring two half-centuries and is immortalised in the pages of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, the bible of the sport.

The sport’s apparent low profile in Scotland can partly be attributed to the fact that Scotland’s national team has never been a force in the international game.

Many of Scotland’s greatest cricketers such as Mike Denness, Gavin Hamilton and Douglas Jardine have played for the English national team as it was their only real chance of playing first class test cricket. In Scotland, cricket arguably is most fervently followed and played in small towns and villages such as Alloa and Freuchie in Fife.

On 8 September 1985, Freuchie won the National Village Cup final against the favourites Rowledge at Lord’s (the home of cricket), the only Scottish team to do so. This was not just the greatest day in Scottish cricket history but one of the greatest achievements by any Scottish sports team.

Clackmannan County Cricket Club is still very much a going concern. Like Freuchie, their players have day jobs as plumbers, teachers, dentists and builders but this does not detract from the passion and dedication which they bring to the cricket field.

Exploring the Manuscript Collection of Louis of Bruges

The 14th and 15th centuries witnessed the rise of great princely and aristocratic libraries all over Europe. These were composed of books that had been inherited, received as gifts, purchased or personally commissioned, either for private devotion and personal education, for pleasure and amusement or for display. Courtly literature on romance and adventure (a large amount of which was usually written in vernacular) rubbed shoulders with scientific, moral, historical, biblical and hagiographic texts.  Parts of these libraries usually followed their patrons in trunks on their voyages while the rest was scattered among their different residences; they were as much a part of their owner’s treasure as furniture, wall hangings or jewels. As they grew, private book collections were usually transferred to dedicated spaces.

King Charles V of France, for example, had his private collection moved from the Royal Palace on the Île de la Cité to a tower in the Louvre fortress in 1367. In this new location, he paid particular attention to adequate lighting and furniture so as to facilitate consultation. He also commissioned French translations of old and new texts covering a broad range of subjects,  to make them more easily available to French-speaking readers. In fact, his personal library (consisting of about 1,000 - 1,300 books) was intended to be used not only privately but also semi-publicly.

These private book collections are very telling on the tastes and interests the high nobility cultivated, and how they established power and prestige. Books commissioned for such libraries were often richly illustrated and luxuriously ornamented to send out a clear message: the more luxurious the book, the more powerful and cultivated the patron. One such patron was the Flemish bibliophile Lodewijk van Gruuthuse, also known as Louis of Bruges (ca. 1427-1492).

During his brilliant career in the Low Countries at the service of the Dukes of Burgundy, Philip the Good and Charles the Bold, Louis of Bruges garnered one of the largest personal book collections of the time (with about 146 known volumes). His library was a clear reflection of himself, as an individual, of his mediaeval culture and of the extraordinary quality of Flemish artistic production in the 15th century. His library was composed of a great number of luxurious manuscripts (almost all in French) dating from the 13th to the first half of the 15th  century and produced in Flanders, France and England.

These books were so valuable that they were often gifted and exchanged. Louis once gifted a copy of theLivre des tournois de René d'Anjou(on one of his favourite subjects - jousting tournaments) to the young king Charles VIII of France.

Like many of his fellow bibliophiles, Louis of Bruges would commission books specifically, but he was also known for buying books ‘off the shelf’. In fact, some books were left with blank spaces for bespoke illustration to fit a buyer’s personal tastes. A patron would often have his or her coat of arms painted into the decoration of dedicatory pages not only in order to easily identify whom the book belonged to as it circulated among the members of the nobility, but also in order to remind others of their intellectual interests. If a book was particularly associated with its patron’s political intentions, some collectors (Louis of Bruges himself) would have themselves represented on the front page, sometimes in the act of engaging with its authors or characters.

Louis would often have his personal identifiers painted into the decoration (crest, canon or mortar, his family insignia or the symbols of the Order of the Golden Fleece - to which he belonged). When books like these were bought, gifted or inherited, these personal identifiers would sometimes be scraped off and replaced by the new possessor’s family insignia, as in the front page of theChronicles of King Charles VII of France, where Louis’s coat of arms has been replaced with those of Louis XII.

Louis of Bruges enjoyed books on combat and jousting tournaments, and had a taste for Arthurian tales such as theLancelot-Graalcycle and theArtus de Bretagnewhich he bought during his travels as an ambassador to England. Like most of his contemporaries, he enjoyed historical chronicles like theChronicles of Flandersor theBook of Heracles(a history of the Crusades). A large part of his collection was also dedicated to French translations of classical texts that highlighted themes of governance and justice, as well as examples of good political action through exemplary characters and events.

Louis’s collection also had moral and religious treatises, as well as illustrated moralised Bibles and the lives of saints. Here, once again, he preferred French translations to the original Latin versions (only four books in his surviving library are in Latin), favouring contemporary as well as local illustrated copies such as theFortress of Faith(translated in Lille, not far from Bruges) orThe Penitence of Adam(translated by Colard Mansion, a book producer, translator and scribe in Bruges).

As with most late mediaeval collectors, Louis passed his collection on to his son, Jean of Bruges. It is unclear whether Jean donated or sold his father’s collection to Louis XII, king of France. However, thanks to this property transfer, 117 volumes of his collection are now kept at the Bibliothèque nationale de France. The majority of the Gruuthuse collection is kept at the Royal Library of the Netherlands in The Hague (including the famous Gruuthuse Musical Manuscript) and the Royal Library of Belgium in Brussels.

The craft of jewellery-making in Byzantium

It's hard to think of an empire that had a more resplendent tradition of jewellery than the Byzantine. For centuries, Byzantium reigned supreme and cultivated the arts, architecture and music together with a unique style of jewellery. Utilizing the splendour and wealth of Greece, Egypt and the Middle East, as well as parts of Russia and North Africa, Byzantine craftspeople created a unique style of jewellery.

In this period of prosperity, men, women and children alike wore bracelets, necklaces, body chains, rings and ornate earrings, coats of arms with heavy rings, decorated with symbolic words, or biblical scenes. Jewellery was a way to represent one’s social status in the Byzantine Era. So much so that Emperor Justinian decreed that some precious gems and stones such as emeralds, pearls, and rubies were for the exclusive use of the Emperor in a law called the Justinian code in 529 AD. The plebs were allowed to wear a golden ring but the Emperor presented diplomats, the military, and high-ranking officials with fine jewellery made by imperial craftsmen and personally selected by the Emperor himself.

With an abundance of gold mined from areas near Constantinople, artisans created luxurious gold pieces of jewellery combined with rubies, sapphires, emeralds, pearls, amethysts, lapis lazuli and other precious stones obtained from trading with India, Persia and the East.

Byzantines imbued gemstones with symbolic meaning. For example, pearls were believed to have come into existence when a lightning bolt struck an oyster shell. As pearls were rare and hard to acquire as they were imported from India, the Gulf and the Red Sea, their value and perception of power increased to an almost symbolic degree. Gems were indeed more important than gold in Byzantine times, and less effort was put into the craftsmanship of gold if the jewellery design was to include big gemstones. Glyptography (the art of carving gemstones) was also popular, withcameosandintagliosin the form of ring stones and pendants.

Coins were also used to make jewellery, a remnant of which can be found today in some Roma cultures. Seen as portable portraits of the emperor, these coins were often imbued with amuletic properties, such as protection against bad luck, illness and evil.

Jewellery for Byzantine royals and the elaborate hierarchy of the court were both luxurious and symbolic. Only the best artisans in the court workshop crafted royal jewellery for the Byzantine Imperial family, not sharing the secrets of their techniques with anyone. As with all things Byzantium, the inspiration for the designs and creativity, in general, was thought to be divinely sent.

Byzantine jewellery made strong use of the Christian cross and other early religious symbols - Christian symbolism was the backbone of all aspects of Byzantine art. Some royal jewellery borrowed Roman and pagan iconography to emphasize a ruler's power. Hellenistic heroes or gods often appeared on Byzantine jewellery alongside Christian imagery. A necklace may have featured military trophies, political symbols or imperial insignia.

Byzantine goldsmiths used a variety of techniques to produce motifs on gold: repetitive motifs were embossed on gold with a dye, individual work was chased and fine detail was achieved by engraving with a fine-tipped tool. The Byzantine artisans were masters of highlighting such delicate details in relief with the use ofniello(a black mixture used as an inlay on etched metal).

Opus interrasile, a kind of pierced openwork metalwork, which was popular in the Roman Empire, was used more elaborately and creatively by Byzantine artists.

From the 9th century onwards, the technique ofcloisonné enamelwas imported from the west only to be perfected and widespread, as it achieved polychromatic designs. Throughout the following centuries, Byzantine jewelry-making reached new heights of craftsmanship, achieving a historic pinnacle of ornate and opulent jewellery.

One can get an idea of the full effect of Byzantium’s rich, sumptuously decorated style by observing the mosaic of Basilica di San Vitale in Ravenna, especially the mosaics of Emperor Justinian and Empress Theodora and her entourage. Iconic and quite baroque, Byzantine glamour was rediscovered in the 20th century by Coco Chanel, who perhaps identified with Theodora who, starting out as an acrobat performer, rose to glory to become the Empress of Byzantium.

‘Written in Insular script’

Further reading

Learn about medieval book lists and how they differ from today's library catalogues

Libraries are places of knowledge. Everyone who owns books and everyone who manages libraries has always wanted to know what exactly they have in their possession. This is as true today as it was in the nineteenth century, or even the Middle Ages.

Medieval book lists show us what was read where and when, and several examples have survived the centuries. Book lists provide excellent insights into cultural history and they are very diverse. First of all, in most cases they only show ownership. Unlike today’s library catalogues, they did not initially function as a finding tool. Sometimes these inventories are just short lists written down on the very first, or the very last, page of a manuscript. Some lists were written on single leaves, some inventories have a systematic approach – others just seem to list one by one. Let’s look at two very different examples.

The first is a book list from Lambach Abbey (Austria). This list was not written on separate parchment leaves, but on the very first page of the manuscript that is best known for its religious texts and miniatures. While the codex was written around 1170-1180, the entries on the first page date from around 1210.

On this – admittedly very full – first page of the manuscript we find a list of twenty titles in the middle. The titles were written one after the other in no recognisable order. These are either manuscripts that belonged to a single person in the monastery (maybe even Gotscalcus de Lambach who is mentioned on fol. 3r) or manuscripts that were given to Lambach library. Even if this list can hardly be called a book inventory, it gives us great insight into what was accessible to some of the monks in Lambach around 1200. In addition to texts that one would expect in a monastery – such as the lives of saints – there are other things to discover. The Lambach book list mentions instructive texts such as Donatus (Ars)minor– a widely used introduction to Latin grammar, but also classical texts that go far beyond learning and practising Latin as a language, like Ovid’sMetamorphoses, hisRemedia Amoris(Love’s Remedy), or hisEpistolae(Letters).

The second example is older, but much more extensive. It is the oldest book inventory of St. Gall Abbey in today’s Switzerland. It was written more than 350 years prior to the Lambach book list. The book inventory from St. Gall lists more than 400 volumes and dates from the middle of the 9th century. It is written on separate parchment leaves at the beginning of a manuscript that contains several law texts (e.g.Lex Salica).

The titles are arranged under 26 headings. In this inventory the books are sorted according to subject groups or authors. For example, the codices with texts by Augustine are collected under the heading:De libris sancti Augustini episcopi; the codices with texts of Beda Venerabilis are listed under the heading:De libris Bedae presbiteri.

The double page of the open book clearly shows that the list was worked on over several decades and that other writers have left their traces. Of course, it is obvious that books have been added. In addition, there are also entries on other pages about the current location of the books (ad scolam[in the school]) or assessments of their content (ad nihil utilia[useless]).

The St. Gall book inventory includes mainly religious and theological volumes. But there are also other volumes. For example, a series of manuscripts with different legal texts, manuscripts with historical texts, a codex with Aratus’Phaenomena(an astronomical text), codices with Isidore’sEtymologiae(a kind of very early etymological encyclopaedia), many manuscripts on Latin grammar beside others by Donatus and Priscian, but also texts by Virgil and commentaries on his works.

An outstanding feature of the oldest St. Gall book inventory is that it begins with a section that does not refer to the manuscript’s content. While all other sections group the manuscripts mainly according to their content, the first column is about the script itself. Under the headingLibri Scottice Scriptithis first section assembles thirty manuscripts.Libri Scottice Scriptimeans “books in Insular script”. The term ‘Insular script’ refers to a number of medieval scripts, all based on a medieval Irish script dating back to the sixth century. Monks spread this script very quickly in Scotland as well as in Anglo-Saxon England and later in some monasteries on the western European continent such as Bobbio, Echternach or Fulda.

Researchers have intensively discussed the insular influence on St. Gall Abbey, named after Saint Gallus, an Irish monk and companion of Saint Columban, who is said to have built a hermitage close to the river Steinach. More than a hundred years later, the Alemanic cleric Otmar founded St. Gall Abbey on this site and served as its first abbot. The connection between St. Gall and the British Isles shows itself in several ways. For example, Irish name entries can be found in various documents. In addition, explanatory Irish entries can be found in Latin manuscripts of St. Gall’s library. Most important, however, are the insular manuscripts in the Abbey’s library itself.

In fact, St. Gall is home to one of the largest collections of Irish manuscripts and fragments from the early Middle Ages outside Ireland. Even today you can find some of these books written and decorated in Insular script in St. Gall’s library. A very fine example isThe Irish Gospel Book of St. Gall(Codex Sangallensis 51) that was produced in Ireland in the middle of the eighth century.

What these book lists show is a diverse and exciting picture of textual culture present in different times and places during the Middle Ages. The inventory from St. Gall also clearly shows traces of cross-regional networking between medieval monasteries.

Unlike modern examples, the two book lists were not intended to serve as actual searching tools like a modern day catalogue. Rather, they were inventories of the works found in the library, showing an emphasis on the content of the manuscripts and the number of volumes. In the St. Gall list we see a systematic approach to make an inventory, whereas the Lambach list appears to have been drafted according to which books the scribe encountered first. Also we should be aware that we are not dealing with the full book collection. Many more books pertaining to liturgy must have been kept at other locations in the abbeys, such as in the church or the vestry, but were often left out of the lists.

Against the background of these two examples of medieval book lists, one must always remember that there were, of course, very many theological and religious manuscripts in all monasteries. In addition, the Latin language was learned with excellent books for grammar and rhetoric written e.g. by Donatus (fourth century) or Priscian (about 500). Medieval clerics learned and trained their Latin with these books as well as with old classics like Virgil and Ovid. Although there are only a few classics on the ninth-century book inventory of St. Gall, more and more ancient texts occur in later lists. The eleventh-century book inventory of Corbie Abbey names among others: Terence, Ovid, Virgil, and Cicero, and a very early Latin copy of Aristotle’sCategories, a treatise on logical thinking.

How to create your own easter egg

Learn about the history of easter eggs and different techniques to make your own

You might have heard of the age-old adage 'What came first: the chicken or the egg?'. It's a philosophical question about the beginning of life and the universe, to which, depending on your religion or philosophy, there are myriad different answers. The powerful symbolism of eggs has been amplified by decorating and displaying them, a practice that is centuries old. The oldest known Easter eggs, more than 5,000 years old, come from Sumerian Mesopotamia. From the fertile crescent the custom of decorating eggs spread all over Europe, where it is cultivated to this day.

The Easter egg, blessed on Easter Saturday, along with other products, is shared by the family at an Easter breakfast, which is impossible to imagine without eggs. The oldest Polish Easter eggs come from the 10th century.

Initially, only women were involved in decorating eggs, and men were not even allowed to enter the room, lest they cast a spell on the Easter egg. Easter eggs are a symbol of fertility and rebirth. In Christianity, they are associated with the resurrection of Christ. Christians have been decorating Easter Eggs with other Christian symbols such as crosses or the lamb of God.

Colouring

The easiest way to decorate your egg without having to blow it out is by changing its colour by boiling it in a coloured broth or using other natural dyes.

You can make your egg brown by cooking it with the outer layer of onions. Your egg will become black if you boil it with oak bark or walnut shells. Yellow eggs are created by boiling them with turmeric. Your egg will turn blue if you rub it with cornflower flowers or put it in blueberry juice. Stain your egg pink with beetroot juice, orange with carrot juice, or red with hibiscus tea.

Scratching

Once your egg has been coloured, you can further decorate it by scratching patterns into the shell. The pattern will be nicely visible if you use white eggs that you've dyed in dark colours. It's easier to scratch into goose or ostrich eggs since they have harder shells. Use a knife or a razor to carefully scratch the patterns into your egg.

Patterns

For more complicated designs, you can cover the egg with patterns of coloured paper, flower petals, yarn, coloured thread, fabric, lace or even seeds.

Batik

This technique involves applying heated wax to the eggshell using a pin or other tool. Then the egg is cooked in the selected dye. In the cooking process, the wax dissolves, but the pattern is not covered with paint.

In the case of blown eggs, the wax-coated egg is immersed in the dye without boiling it, then dried.

Finally, the wax is removed mechanically from the blown egg or melted over the candle flame.

This technique can be repeated with different patterns and colours to achieve beautiful intricate multicoloured easter eggs. The decorations people create differ from region to region, cultivating local traditions. Nowadays, you can easily decorate easter eggs by just using paint and paintbrushes, but these traditional techniques have survived for centuries and are still used by many around Easter time. How do you decorate your eggs?

How Corbie Abbey's medieval manuscripts connect to today's fonts

When you think of the French region of Picardy, most likely important cities such as Amiens, Beauvais, or Laon come to mind. Corbie is less known and it is not that easy to find even on 18th-century maps of northern France.

Nonetheless, Corbie was once very important, as testified by wonderful medieval manuscripts. How we write with lower case letters today is also connected to this place and especially to its former monastery:L’abbaye royale Saint-Pierre de Corbie.

This Benedictine monastery was founded around 660 by Bathilda, the widow of Clovis II, King of Neustria and Burgundy. Its first abbot and monks came from Luxeuil Abbey, which had been founded in 590 by the Irish missionarySt. Columbanus. Looking at 7th, 8th, and 9th century manuscripts from Luxeuil and Corbie you can still observe Irish influence, especially in the style of their illuminations. You discover Celtic ornaments – as here at the beginning of Psalm 1 and its initial B (ofBeatus vir), made with interlaces common in Celtic art.

The library at Corbie Abbey grew quite quickly. Some of its manuscripts have survived the centuries and are now kept in libraries in Amiens, Paris, Berlin, Rome and Saint Petersburg, among others.

Many of these manuscripts can be attributed with certainty to Corbie Abbey as they contain traces, like marks and/or inscriptions that link the book to the monastery. These can often be found at the beginning (e.g. ownership notes) or at the end of the book (in acolophon). Furthermore, there are also three medieval book inventories. These book inventories show the variety of books that were read in Corbie. In addition to books with theological content and books for worship and devotion, they also refer to several codices containing texts by ancient and late antique authors. Take, for example, this page of Corbie’s 11th-century book inventory: the left column lists the Categories of Aristotle (third entry), as well as several grammars of the Latin language or different titles by Boethius and Cicero.

Even more important than the library of Corbie Abbey is its scriptorium – the place where monks copied these texts, using feather, ink and parchment. Even if it is hard to imagine, the 7th, 8th and 9th centuries saw exciting developments in Latin scripts. The monks of Corbie’s scriptorium experimented with different ways to write, as David Ganz (Professor Emeritus of Palaeography, King's College London) among others has shown. These experiments are still visible today – in the manuscripts written in Corbie.

One medieval script has become particularly important for the art of reading, not only during the Middle Ages, but also until today: the Carolingian (or Caroline) minuscule. For a long time, researchers believed that the Carolingian minuscule was developed in the immediate vicinity of Charlemagne and his court school as part of the educational reform of the 9th century. Recent research by Tino Licht (Professor of Latin Medieval Philology, University of Heidelberg) has brought into discussion that the Carolingian minuscule is a result of experimenting with different scripts. A Corbie manuscript from the second half of the 8th century – now preserved in the Berlin State Library – shows an amazing feature. While the manuscript begins on the first page with a script called half-uncial, the second page is written in a different script: an early form of the Carolingian minuscule. There are three pages with this script before the script changes again to half-uncial. The difference is very clear when you compare the pages side by side.

On the left page (fol. 2v): Carolingian minuscule. On the right page (fol. 3r): half-uncial.

With the educational reform efforts of Charlemagne’s court school at the beginning of the 9th century, the Carolingian minuscule began its triumph through all of Central Europe. It would remain the most important script until the beginning of the 12th century, when it developed into pre-Gothic script. But why should we care about a script that was developed and used some thousand years ago? How are we connected to this script?

In the late 14th and 15th centuries, Renaissance humanists tried to find the best handwritten copies of texts from Classical Antiquity which they held in high esteem. While searching in different monasteries, they found old manuscripts written in Carolingian minuscule. This script is quite different to later medieval scripts. The pictures below show close-ups of Genesis 1:27 in two different manuscripts. The first was written in the middle of the 9th century using Carolingian minuscule. The second example is a copy from the last quarter of the 13th century written in a Gothic script. While the Gothic script of the later manuscript is very compressed and contains many abbreviations, the Carolingian minuscule appears very calm, rounded and regular. The words are written and spaced clearly.

The simplicity and clarity of the Carolingian minuscule fascinated the Renaissance humanists. They believed that this script must have been the script of antiquity and this is why the Carolingian minuscule became the model for the Humanistic minuscule. Some book printers took the Humanistic minuscule as inspiration for moveable type, which in the second half of the 15th century resulted in a font called Antiqua. This font had been used by the most important book printers of the Renaissance, such as the Venetian Aldus Manutius, who published this famous edition ofHypnerotomachia Poliphiliby Franciscus Columna in 1499:

The Antiqua font, used in Venice for printing in its most beautiful form, quickly spread across Europe and we can still observe some of its characteristics in 20th-century fonts like Times New Roman.

This is a close-up of text from the printed page above and the same text typed in Times New Roman. It is striking how close these two scripts are even if the left one was used by the end of the 15th century the other in the late 20th (and in the 21st) century.

In this way, the lower case letters we use today are descendants of a script that the monks of Corbie experimented with more than 1200 years ago.

Saarinen and the Museum of Finnish Architecture

Exploring treasures in the Museum of Finnish Architecture

Eliel Saarinen (1873–1950) was the first Finnish architect to rise to international fame in the early 20th century. His importance to Finnish architecture is indisputable. In this blog, we will explore his collection of drawings which have been the key collection of the Museum of Finnish Architecture since the museum’s beginning.

The main theme of Saarinen’s architecture throughout his career was the 'total work of art', the aesthetic whole of the building, environment and interiors. While still a student, he set up an office together with his fellow students Herman Gesellius and Armas Lindgren. They made an international breakthrough with the Finnish Pavilion at the 1900 Paris World Fair and designed several buildings together between 1896 and 1905.

After 1905, Saarinen continued to work with Herman Gesellius and founded his own office a few years later. His designs shifted from National Romantic style to a more rational style. The use of symmetry and geometrically defined structures are present in Helsinki railway station which is his key project of this period and probably the best known of Eliel Saarinen’s buildings. The collection holds some amazing indoor perspectives (1910–1913).

In the 1910s, Saarinen designed several city plans. He made a study for a Budapest master plan and master plans for Tallinn and Canberra. In Finland, he designed a plan for the Munkkiniemi-Haaga district in Helsinki and a pioneering urban project for greater Helsinki.

In 1922, Saarinen participated in a competition for the Chicago Tribune building and won the second prize. His elegant design aroused a lot of attention and, in hope of better assignments, Saarinen moved to the United States in 1923 and stayed there until his death.

He was invited to design the master plan and the campus of the Cranbrook Academy of Art and headed its Department of Architecture and Urban Design from 1932 to 1950.

Saarinen participated in several competitions in Europe, including those for The Peace Palace in The Hague (1906) and the Palace of Nations in Geneva (1927). Even though twenty years apart, both have an appealing atmosphere of peace and tranquility. Saarinen’s competition entries did not appeal to the organisers, but we can enjoy the beauty of these designs today.

The collection of 256 drawings were donated to the Association of Finnish Architects in 1952, two years after Eliel Saarinen’s death. The collection became the founding collection of the museum. The Museum of Finnish Architecture was established in 1956 and it is the second oldest architectural museum in the world.

Several private individuals and organisations have donated Eliel Saarinen’s drawings to the museum and now the collection contains about 500 drawings and sketches as well as hundreds of photographs of Saarinen’s buildings. The copyright of Eliel Saarinen's works expired in the beginning of 2021 and the museum decided to digitise the whole collection and publish it as high-resolution images for free use.

In a few months, The Museum of Finnish Architecture will publish more high-resolution images online. This time the theme of the celebration is the 150th anniversary of the birth of Wivi Lönn. She was among the first female architects in Europe and a fellow student of Eliel Saarinen.

When Scotland's footballers were the Wembley Wizards

England v Scotland is the oldest international football fixture in the world.

The first official match between the two teams took place on the 30 November 1872 at the West of Scotland Cricket Club in Glasgow. The match ended in a 0-0 draw. Just over a decade later, in 1883, the first international tournament was established, the British Home Championship. This was an annual competition between the United Kingdom’s four national teams at the time: England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales.

The tournament was generally dominated by Scotland and England but, in the 1927-1928 Championship, both sides had underperformed. Scotland had lost to Ireland and drawn with Wales and England had lost to both Ireland and Wales. The England v Scotland match at Wembley on 31 March 1928 was therefore of little consequence, effectively a play-off for third and fourth place.

The team selected for the match by the Scottish Football Association was controversial.

Many popular regulars were dropped, and the forward line of Alex Jackson, Hughie Gallagher, James Dunn, Alex James and Alan Morton was thought to lack both flair and physical presence. At 5 foot 7 inches, Jackson was the tallest. Hughie Gallacher’s selection at the expense of the popular Celtic player Jimmy McGrory was especially controversial, as Gallacher was returning from a two-month suspension for pushing a referee into a bath. In Scotland, it was widely thought that an England side which included centre forward Dixie Dean, then at the peak of his career, would win the match.

Hopes might not have been high, but this did not prevent an exodus from Scotland to England to see the match. Eleven trains left for Wembley from Glasgow alone. The streets of London were full of fans in tartan bonnets when Scotland’s captain Jimmy McMullan addressed his players in the Regent Palace Hotel on the night before the match. McMullan told the players to '…go to your bed, put you head on your pillow and pray for rain', as a heavy pitch would favour the Scottish team. They awoke the next morning to the sound of heavy rain - their prayers had been answered.

The Scotland team began to think this might be their day after all.

In the first piece of action in the game England’s Billy Smith hit Scotland’s post. Scotland immediately struck back, with Alex Jackson scoring a goal just three minutes into the game. The rest of the first half was goalless until the last minute when, with his left foot, Alex James of Scotland struck the ball past England’s goalkeeper Ted Hufton.

The second half is one of the most celebrated 45 minutes in Scottish football history. Scotland scored another three goals, making a final total of five goals for Scotland, three scored by Alex Jackson and two by Alex James. In the last-minute Bob Kelly put England on the scoreboard making the final score England 1 Scotland 5. The songSingin' in the Rainwas written in either 1928 or 1929 and would have been a suitable soundtrack for the matches aftermath, as thousands of Scotsmen sang and danced in the Wembley rain.

The Scotland team became known as the Wembley Wizards, and it would be the only time that line up took to the field. Scotland would win the subsequent Home Championship 1928-1929, beating Wales 4-2 with Hughie Gallagher scoring a hat-trick and beating Ireland 7-3 with Gallagher finding the net four times. England would get their revenge just over two years later when they beat Scotland 5-2 on 5 April 1930 at Wembley.

It is unlikely that anyone alive today attended the match but what happened on that rainy spring day in 1928 is still discussed on Scotland’s football message boards.

The names of Hughie Gallacher, Alex Jackson and Alex James are still familiar to many Scottish football fans. Little footage of the match survives, only a few minutes from contemporary newsreels. You can though get a feel for the importance of this match and the significance of the occasion by looking at the programme. I imagine many a soaked Scotland supporter made their way home with a copy of the programme in 1928, and that a few copies are still treasured family heirlooms.

Popular singer and actor of the 'zarzuela' genre

Rosario Soler was a famous actress and soprano singer who performed in Madrid at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. She performed works of what is known as the 'género chico' (literally, 'little genre', a Spanish genre of short, light plays with music).

Rosario Illescas Sánchez was born in Málaga on August 16, 1879. Her parents were Salvador Illescas and María Candelaria Sánchez, and she took the artistic surname Soler from her cousin because it sounded very musical for her.

Rosario started her career at the Teatro Vital Aza in Málaga, where her brother was the stage manager. She took part in small roles and soon became familiar with the artists and the performances.

At the age of sixteen, she moved to Madrid. She performed at small theatres until she made her debut at Príncipe Alfonso Theatre with the workCuadros disolventes, which received a great reception from the public.

Cuadros disolventesis an example of 'theatre by hours', a popular, cheap form of theatre with comic and satirical purposes. It is a form of Costumbrist theatre, a literary form involving interpretation of local everyday life, mannerisms, and customs which became a revolution in the Madrid scene at the turn of the century. In this type of theatre, several works could be represented on the same night, but none of them exceeded longer than one hour in length.

This type of role gave Rosario great versatility in her performances.

In August 1896, she travelled to Mexico and premiered the 'zarzuela' (a Spanish lyric-dramatic genre)La marcha de Cádizat the Principal Theatre, obtaining great success from public and critics who praised her performance in theDúo de los Patos('duck duet'), which earned her the nickname 'La Patita' ('The little duck').

In this theatre, she also performedLa revoltosa('The Troublemaker') for the first time and was acclaimed for the duet of Mari Pepa and Felipe.

Other zarzuelas premiered by Rosario in Mexico wereLa buena sombra('The good shadow'),El mantón de Manila('The manila shawl'),La viejecita('The old lady') orEl paraíso perdido('The lost paradise'). This latter was criticised for being somewhat provocative for the time.

The invention of the cinematograph was also an opportunity for Rosario and, in 1899, she filmed the movieRosario Soler en sevillanasin Mexico.

In 1901, Rosario left Mexico to arrive in Havana, where she premiered the zarzuelaLa Parranda('The party'), which was very well received too. Her stay there was short because, at that time, she dreamt of studying singing with a great teacher. She moved to Milan to do this until 1903, when she returned to Madrid.

In the capital city, she performed at the Teatro de la Zarzuela three pieces 'by hours':La buena sombra('The good shadow'),Venus salónandParador de las Golondrinas('Swallow's Inn'). She also worked at the Eslava, Tívoli and Novedades theatres, discovering that the 'theatre by hours' could also be performed on large stages.

In 1904, some pieces sung by Rosario at the Teatro de la Zarzuela were banned because they criticised the government. Led by Prime Minister Antonio Maura, the Civil Governor of Madrid closed this theatre and arrested several interpreters. Everything was resolved with the theatres agreeing to no longer stage any more political couplets.

After undergoing an operation on her vocal cords, Rosario continued her work at the Zarzuela, where she was known as the 'real' Mari Pepa fromLa Revoltosa('The troublemaker').

In 1907, she was already the first soprano of the Apolo theatre, and her grace, beauty and inspiration were praised. That same year she began to record several albums that were re-issued until the 1920s.

In June 1908 Rosario performedLas Bribonas(“Las bribonas”) in this theatre, her most eagerly awaited premiere after years of not having new repertoire.

Las Bribonasis a one-act zarzuela divided into five scenes with a libretto by Antonio Martínez Viérgol and music by Rafael Calleja. Its plot ridicules the pious women of a town who were scandalised by the arrival of a variety troupe. In it, Rosario, in the role ofTrini La Jerezana('Trini from Jerez'), singing the frivolous coupletLa maquinista del amor('The driver of love'), which qualified this zarzuela as 'negligible genre'.

Rosario was so highly appreciated that advertising brands used her image. In the following picture we can see her sponsoring a hair product in a newspaper advertisement.

In 1910 she left the Apolo theatre and joined the Lyric Theatre, making her last two premieres in Spain,* El poeta de la vida* ('The poet of life') andEl país de las hadas('Fairyland'), before returning to Mexico, where she stayed until 1919.

In 1910 Rosario wrote a story for the Cuentos Galantes magazine entitled 'The 25 kilometre man', which was a naïve story about an unfaithful man who pretended to be doing sport with his bicycle to be with his lover. Press reviews were not favourable.

In 1920, she married Jacques Sittler Daesslé, from Alsace, who removed her from the scene for a time during which she travelled around Europe.

In those years, the 'género chico' was witnessing its decline and was disappearing from both small and big theatres, as the public already found it 'sappy, puerile'. Cinema made it disappear definitively, with longer shows such as opera and 'grande' zarzuelas returning to theatres, as well as those with a more frivolous tone like varieties and revues.

In 1923 Rosario, who was living in Nice, returned to Spain and performed, although she did not want to submit to the new variety trends. But Jacques's health brought them back to Nice where they bought a villa by the sea.

In 1931, she returned to Málaga to collaborate in charity events and the couple settled in the town Alahurín de la Torre, where they were seen driving around in their 'magnificent Cadillac'. Shortly afterwards, Jacques passed away.

With a life now completely away from the stage, Rosario Soler, 'The little duck', died on November 22, 1944 in Malaga at the age of 64.

'The perfect review for women and girls’

Subtitled ‘The perfect review for women and girls’,Feminawas an illustrated magazine created on 1 February 1901 by Pierre Lafitte which took its name from the Latin wordfemina, meaning ‘woman’.

Feminawas the first French magazine targeting a female audience, consisting mainly of readers belonging to the middle class. The support of early-20th century Parisian fashion was central for the magazine, advertised through the pages as the most fashionable option for intelligent and refined women caring about their appearance.

The illustrations represented the main attraction of the magazine.

In May 1903, theFeminaedition titled 'Women Artists at the 1903 Salon' dedicated three pages to the illustrations of Louise Abbéma, Louise Catherine Breslau, Camille Claudel, Maximilienne Guyon Louise Clément-Carpeaux, Laure Coutan-Montorgueil and Juana Romani. After a few years, the magazine cover, which had previously been mostly a reproduction of a photograph, started to be accompanied by a cartoon illustration in bi-chroma.

Anne R. Epstein, in her review of the book by Colette Cosnier,The Ladies of Femina, described a mystified feminism in the editorial direction of the magazine.

Indeed,Feminawas not born to be a feminist magazine but rather a woman’s magazine. The editorial strategy of Pierre Lafitte, the publishing director, was inspired byThe Ladies’ Magazine, a successful English publication.

Lafitte envisioned a luxury magazine dealing with fashion trends, society and family. However, feminist topics of the time – including the claims of the suffragettes in England and the acquisition of voting right by the Danish women – were treated and discussed in the journal. Moreover, Lafitte used to give great prominence to leisure and sports practised by women and, from 1906, he launched The Femina Cup, a golfing competition.

In 1909, the French Academy raised the question of the election of female members: immediatelyFeminaasked its readers to elect 40 writers, to fill an imaginary female academy and published on a double-page an illustration showing the 40 elected seats in the institution’s dome.

After being suspended in 1917, Pierre Lafitte sold the journal to Hachette; the publishing house then mergedFeminawith another magazine calledThe Happy Life.

Building on the success of the name, in the 1950s another magazine started being published: the first number ofNouveau Feminacame out in 1954, presenting the spring collections and marking the reopening of the maison Chanel with a piece by Jean Cocteau.

How 'Sisi' was celebrated and remembered in Hungary

Elisabeth was Empress of Austria from 1854 when her husband Franz Joseph I ascended to the Austrian throne. From 1867 - when the Austro-Hungarian Compromise created the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary - she became Queen Consort of Hungary. Over the course of her reign, she became a popular and cult figure in both Austria and Hungary.

Born in 1837, Elisabeth Amalia Eugénia Wittelsbach was lauded as being one of the most beautiful women of her time. Although she emphasised this quality, that is not why she became a cult figure for Hungarians.

The Empress of Austria was averse to life in the Austrian court, which was conducted according to Spanish etiquette. These protocols caused Elisabeth many embarrassing moments, as she was shy and soft-spoken and considered a 'pretty silly girl', a prejudice not improved by the fact that she eschewed her official duties as soon as she could. In her country, her personality was a mere sideshow to Franz Joseph, and she tried to keep her participation in public events to a minimum, having little contact with her subjects.

In Hungary, on the other hand, a very different image of the Empress already developed during her lifetime.

She was seen as being endowed with morally unquestionable elements that made her a kind of counterpoint to the Emperor. This image became all the more so, as a theory became widespread that she played a major role in the creation of the1867 Austro-Hungarian Compromise, and thus the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. Historians, however, argue that Queen Elisabeth had little involvement in political affairs, but the figure of the Hungarian-friendly Elisabeth shone in the Hungarian public consciousness as the saviour of the country.

The Empress's relationship with Hungarians began during her engagement, when she became acquainted with the history of the empire, including Hungarian history, through her teacher János Majláth. Elisabeth was fond of the Hungarians, but perhaps her mother-in-law's open antipathy towards Hungarians also strengthened her sympathy. She surrounded herself with Hungarian ladies-in-waiting, spoke Hungarian well, and conversed with her youngest child, Maria Valeria, in Hungarian. Gödöllő was one of her favourite settlements in Hungary.

After the Compromise, the Hungarian state offered the Gödöllő estate as a gift to the ruling couple, who occupied the residence the same year. During her time there, Elisabeth was able to escape the rigid rules of the austere Viennese court and indulge her passion for horse riding. Her youngest child, who was also born in Hungary, spent much of her time here.

Shockingly, Elisabeth was assassinated in 1898. After her death, efforts to preserve her memory increased.

Several public statues were erected in her memory, including the Elisabeth Lookout Tower on János Hill in Hungary; also, her memorial and the Elisabeth Park in Gödöllő was completed after that.

In addition, a memorial museum was housed for many years in the Buda Castle Palace. The Queen’s ladies-in-waiting, Ida Ferenczy and Countess Irma Sztáray, significantly contributed to the collection. Undoubtedly, the most unique item in the collection is the bodice worn during her assassination, which was donated to the museum by Countess Sztáray and is now owned by the Hungarian National Museum.

After her tragic death, Elisabeth became a cult figure in Austria as well, but in a very different way, she was seen as a pioneer of the modern female ideal. Her efforts to preserve her beauty made her a humane figure. The Empress rode horses regularly to maintain her slimness, but exercise was part of her life even when she was forced to neglect equestrian sports, as evidenced by her gymnastics apparatus in theSisi Museum in the Hofburg Place in Vienna.

However, Sisi was not only ahead of her time when it came to beauty care and a healthy lifestyle, she was also an example of an unhappy woman in search of herself, wishing to preserve her freedom, and whose memory is still cherished by many.

How women in the past have strongly advocated for better care of our fragile planet

The women’s movement in the late 1960s and 1970s brought attention to the need to consider how the environment and the lives of women intersected in ways that often lead to social injustice, poverty, exploitation and oppression. While this arm of the feminist movement may seem a relatively new initiative by women - [the French feminist Françoise d’Eaubonne is credited with coining the term, ecofeminism in 1974] - we can trace this initiative back to the distant past.

Medieval mysticism opened spaces for women’s voices on a variety of subjects (for example, church corruption, history, morality), including that of care for the earth.

We see this in the writings of Hildegard von Bingen, a 12th century mystic, artist, composer, writer, Doctor of the Church and recently a saint [2010].

While she did not have a concept of the word feminism let alone ecofeminism, it is through her work that we can understand her contribution to the ideals of ecofeminism, albeit from a Christian perspective.

Hildegard von Bingen understood that 'the divine is present in the greening of the earth'. Her term for this phenomenon isviriditasor ‘greenness’.

For Hildegard, this is the life-giving force that is inherent in creation. It is associated with fertility, transformation and renewal. Her image of a God with a green finger is recogniSable to all who grow things. She says:

Greenness of God's finger,
Through you God has planted a vineyard
That gleams on high
Like a carved pillar

Hildegard understood that there was a connection between humankind and nature.

It is interesting that she does not qualify this by gender. Indeed, this is in alignment with feminist principles that advocating for all of humankind must be the focus of feminist work. Yet, Hildegard does celebrate feminine fertility in her creative work, especially in her poetry as evidenced here:

Holy persons draw to themselves all that is earthly.. 
The Earth is at the same time mother, 
She is mother of all that is natural,
Mother of all that is human,
She is mother of all,
for contained in her
are the seeds of all.

It is not denigrating that she, as some ecofeminists argue, associates women with nature, especially in her sensitive understanding of the world as an organic, dynamic interconnected entity. She proclaims in another one of her writings:

Humanity, take a good look at yourself.
Inside, you’ve got Heaven and Earth, and all of creation.
You’re a world-everything is hidden in you.

If we can see ourselves from this perspective, we can embrace ecofeminism as a way to address the devastation of such events as climate change, overuse of fossil fuels, exploitation of migrant workers, inequality in health care, overfishing in certain waters, and loss of flora and fauna species.

These are the concerns of ecofeminists and these concerns were also expressed by Hildegard from a different perspective over a thousand years ago.

It is remarkable that this mystic already could see the effects of our human footprints on the Earth. Perhaps the following lines from an early proto feminist who artistically spoke about her concerns for the health of our planet, despite the restrictions imposed upon her by a patriarchal society, can serve as inspiration for us all:

Humankind, full of all creative possibilities is God’s work. Humankind alone is called to assist God. Humankind is called to co-create. With nature’s help, humankind can set into creation all that is necessary and life-sustaining.

Four women in history who helped change the world we live in

Throughout history, women's contributions and accomplishments have been generally overlooked. This is even more so for women with disabilities, whose stories and achievements seem to be often left out of women's history. These women have achieved great things, from activism, politics to even becoming war heroes. Let's take a look at four of them whose identities intersect in several ways, proving that no one fits in a single box.

Rosa May Billinghurstwas a British suffragette and women's rights activist born 31 May 1875.

Her mother’s family manufactured piano’s and her father was a banker. She survived polio as a child and was left unable to walk. She wore leg irons and either used crutches or a tricycle to move around.

In 1907 she became a member of the Women’s Social and Political Union (WSPU) and two years later founded its Greenwhich branch.

She attended the ‘Black Friday’ demonstrations and was arrested after the police capsized her from her tricycle. She was once left on a side street by the police after they let the air out of her tires and stole the valves. Despite the brutality she faced by the police and her arrests, she kept taking part in demonstrations where she would place her crutches on both sides of her tricycle and charge on.

Noor Inayat Khanwas a British resistance agent in France who served as a Special Operations Executive in World War Two. 
She was born 1 January 1914 to Inayat Khan, an Indian Muslim professor of musicology, and Pirani Ameena Begum (born Ora Ray Baker), an American poet.

In 1940 Noor joined the Women’s Auxiliary Airforce, and was assigned to be trained as a wireless operator. She was the first woman sent for specialised training in occupied territory when she was deployed as a spy to France.

Her fingers were permanently swollen due to a circulation disorder in which the small blood vessels are inflammed, calledchilblains. Due to this she had a distinctive style of tapping out Morse Code.

She was captured towards the end of the war, and attempted to escape twice. After her escape attempts she was transferred to the Dachau concentration camp, where she was executed. After her death she was awarded the George Cross, the highest civilian decoration in the UK  and the French Croix de Guerre with a silver star.

I wish some Indians would win high military distinction in this war. If one or two could do something in the Allied service which was very brave and which everybody admired, it would help to make a bridge between the English people and the Indians.

Barbara Jordanwas a lawyer, educator, politician, and a Civil Rights leader. She was born 21 February 1936 in Houston, Texas, and she became the first Black American elected to the Texas Senate in 1966, and the first Black woman from the South elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1972.

During her time in the Texas Legislature, she sponsored or co-sponsored more than 70 bills, mostly in support of underprivileged and minoritised communities.

She is described by the U.S National Archives as the first LGBTQ+ woman in congress. Though she never spoke out about her sexuality in her lifetime, her life companion, Nancy Earl was not kept a secret either. In 1973 Barbara began to suffer from multiple sclerosis and Nancy became her main caregiver. After her death in 1996, she became the first Black American to be buried in the Texas State Cemetary.

If the society today allows wrongs to go unchallenged, the impression is created that those wrongs have the approval of the majority.

Jazzie Collinswas a Black American trans woman activist and community organiser for transgender rights, disability rights and economic equality in San Fransisco.

She was born 24 September, 1958 in Memphis Tennessee and moved to San Fransisco in 1988. In San Francisco she campaigned on behalf of minoritised communities and was one of the original members of Queers for Economic Equality Now (QUEEN). She organised a number of protests as well as the city’s annual Trans March and was also Vice Chair of both the LGBT Ageing Policy and LGBT Senior Disabled Housing Task Forces.

Jazzie was community manager for an organisation dedicated to defending the rights of seniors and disabled people called Senior and Disability Action. She was also open about being HIV positive and two years after her death in 2013, the first homeless shelter in the United States for the adult LGBTQ+ community was opened in her honour and called Jazzie's Place.

How the Vivandières' uniforms reflected their role

When we think about the army, what usually comes to mind are images of male soldiers dressed in uniforms, indicating their country, their political affiliation or ideological beliefs. However, being a diversified and complex community, the army  is – and was – made up by representatives of both genders, working together and sharing spaces, time and, interestingly, style.

The Vivandières – or cantinières – were originally associated with French regiments, but they were present in many different countries as a fundamental part of the army. As important members of their regiment, they had several tasks: carrying food and drinks to soldiers on the battlefield, as well as acting as nurses and supporters of the troops.

Their importance within the environment of the regiment is in some way proved by their ‘official’ appearance – their uniform – which made them more than mere camp-followers, not only participating in the every-day activities of the army, but living the experience as protagonists.

The uniforms of the Vivandières were modelled after those of the regiment they served. This tells a lot about how they considered their role, as ‘soldiers’ belonging to the army, whose identity was constructed not only through their occupation, but also through their attire.

Their outfit was usually composed by a jacket and a blouse, which could be tight or loose-fitting depending on the regiments they belonged to. Trousers could also be either straight legged or full and wide legged, gathered at the ankle or below the knee. A knee-length skirt was usually over the trousers.

As for the accessories, they had great importance in completing the look: the most iconic accessory is for sure the brandy barrel, called tonnelet, which was a unifying element in defining the cantinières across different regiments.

Vivandières also used to wear hats, either 'kepis' or brimmed. Their uniform fulfils two main aspects required to army clothing – and uniforms more generally: it serves as 'sign', defining the identity of vivandières as members of a precise regiment, and it is also practical, allowing them the possibility to move and ride more freely than they would do wearing ‘civilian’ female clothing.

At the end of the 19th century, cantinières were forced by regulations to replace their attires with plain grey dresses and metal identification plaques. Despite their popularity, they were banned in 1906 by the French War Ministry. Vivandières' image remained strongly present in popular culture, theatre, opera and advertising.

Women on Greek public television from the late 1960s to today

On February 23, 1966, journalist and presenter Eleni Kypraiou welcomed Greek viewers for the first time by announcing the television programme of the day. This was the official launch of Greek public television, operated by the National Radio Foundation (EIR). Since then, the presence of women on Greek television in shows and documentaries has taken various forms, influenced by social and political developments in the country.

The first steps of Greek television coincided with the imposition of the seven-year-long military dictatorship on April 21, 1967. The Armed Forces Information Service (initially named “TED”, later renamed to “YENED”) was the second TV channel. In 1970, EIR was renamed to “National Foundation of Radio and Television - EIRT”.

Within a militaristic, anti-communist, extremely conservative and patriarchal regime, Greek female TV presenters were trapped in the role of "hostesses" in fashion and beauty shows, children's programmes and culture shows, which were broadcast mainly on the YENED channel.

Atrailerbroadcast on this channel promoted a programme about women's interests (mainly shows of fashion, beauty and wellness).

After the restoration of democracy in 1974, a more liberal period began in which women gradually gained more rights and wider participation in public life. In 1975, Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT) was founded as a successor of EIRT. The first female technicians began working on public television as editors and sound engineers. Nonetheless, they still encountered suspicion and prejudice from their male colleagues.

During this decade notable women in Greek public life began appearing on television, talking mostly about the importance of restoring democracy, the emerging new era that was beginning for the country, and female achievements. Melina Mercouri, an important actress and politician, spoke in 1974 on the show Reporters about her return to Greece, her plans concerning culture, and her intentions to direct a documentary about Greek women for the Greek National Television.

Another characteristic show from that period is titledModern Eve. The journalist Elli Evangelidou hosted the show for more than ten years, discussing important contemporary issues with her guests. In this excerpt, Helene Glykatzi-Ahrweiler, rector of the Sorbonne University, discusses educational, artistic, historical and social issues with Elli Evangelidou.

During the 1980s, major changes in Greek family law were made and, for the first time, women were largely equated with men. Public television broadcast documentaries that highlighted the contribution of Greek women to key moments in the country's history. In the episode ‘Women who participated in the Greek Resistance Movement’ from the documentary seriesBorn a woman(1982), the participation of women in the Resistance during the Nazi occupation of the country (1941-1944) is highlighted.

At the same time, female journalists and presenters became more involved in presenting news bulletins or undertaking difficult reporting assignments. ERT journalist Evi Demiri visited Southern Lebanon in 1981, talking to young  Palestinian fighters and the president of the Palestinian Authority and leader of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, Yasser Arafat.

During the 1980s, public television devoted a number of programmes to the promotion of female public figures, distinguished in letters and arts as well as ordinary women.Woman on television, a 1985 news programme, focuses on the representation of Greek women on TV.

The advent of private television in 1989 resulted in intense competition between private and public TV stations. The leading private broadcasters adopted successful formats, such as music shows, Greek sitcoms, dramas and soap operas.

In an effort to adjust to the new competitive television landscape, lighthearted programs made their appearance on ERT, reproducing the stereotypical image of beautiful women that were presented on the private channels.

This effort is reflected on the covers of ERT's official magazineRadio-Television, which for the first time featured glamorous and beautiful women.

Despite the competition, Greek public television maintained a focus on quality and depth. More emphasis was put on informative and educational programmes, while more women made their appearance on Greek public TV in key roles. ERT journalist Liana Kanelli presented the talk show Logo Timis (‘Word of Honor’). In the following excerpt, Κanelli talks with French author Pascal Bruckner about European politics and culture.

Through its long-standing tradition of producing high-quality documentaries, as well as through efforts to fulfill the needs of diverse audiences, the programming of public television during the 2000s addressed contemporary social issues, like immigration and racism. The documentary of director Pandora Mouriki,Home - My Sierra Leone(2007) presents the life of Antonia Medevi, a 14-year old, second generation immigrant.

Nowadays, women journalists host a variety of news and entertainment programmes. Contemporary productions, such as the documentary seriesDangerous(2021-22), highlights issues from which women suffer today, like domestic violence, sexual identity and self-identification.

Women have played a decisive role since the beginning of Greek public television. Full of dynamism, as well as sensitivity and creativity, women continue to shine and be on the vanguard of television history, both on screen and behind the cameras.

Lady Day, Billie Holiday (1915-1959)

Queen of Jazz, Ella Fitzgerald (1917-1996)

The Divine One, Sarah Vaughan (1924-1990)

High Priestess of Soul, Nina Simone (1933- 2003)

Young, gifted and Black

They were young, gifted and Black and today, we celebrate them. They were once in a lifetime talents, visionaries and geniuses who left a unique music legacy in Europe and across the world. With unprecedented strength and determination, they stood up for themselves, became civil rights activists, broke the mould with their music and opened the path for many other women to succeed regardless of their colour. They also had difficult lives and saw unbearable tragedies. Physical, mental, alcohol, drug abuse are words that resonate in some of their biographies. The most talented women in jazz were survivers of two of the most prevalent discriminations even today: to be women and Black.

Born Eleanora Fagan, she will always be remembered for her magnetic interpretation on stage and almost instrumental-like voice. Miles Davis said, ‘Billie Holiday doesn’t need any real horns, she sounds like one anyway’. For many, she was the greatest vocalist of Strange Fruit, a song written in 1937 by Abel Meeropola that depicts a lynching and the most infamous episodes of racism. The song became an anthem of the civil rights movement, and with her unique voice and courage, a protest song in all her concerts.

Billie Holiday toured twice in Europe. First in 1954, thanks to the Swedish entrepreneur Nils Hellstrom, starting in Stockholm, then Germany, Netherlands, Paris and Switzerland.

The second time was in 1959 when she made one of her last television appearances for Granada's Chelsea at Nine in London.

She died the same year not without leaving us with a final studio recording orchestrated by Ray Ellis, who also accompanied her on the famous album Lady in Satin from 1958.

Despite limited commercial success in her lifetime, Holiday won posthumously four Grammy Awards and her melodies and recordings changed the sound of jazz forever. Her life has been depicted in several movies like Lady Sings the Blues interpreted by Diana Ross.

It's an arduous task to summarise 60 years of a successful career. Perfect diction and tone, master of the scat song (onomatopoeic, and nonsense syllables improvisational vocal singing), her silky voice is recognisable even for those who are unfamiliar with jazz, thanks to her well-known standards interpretations like Dream a Little Dream of Me, Summertime or Cheek to Cheek fromthe Great American Songbook.

After  initial musical success with the Chick Webb Orchestra, she started her solo career with Verve, one of the world’s largest jazz record labels. Collaboration with Louis Amstrong and Duke Ellington, as well as movie and popular TV shows appearances, helped her achieve fame in her country.

She also enjoyed amazing success in Europe. At the peak of her career, and from 1957 to 1960s Ella travelled almost every year to Europe with the show produced by Norman Granz, travelling all over the world together. Among her many awards, she counts fourteen Grammys.

Sara Vaughan became a professional singer after winning a talent contest held at the famous Harlem's Apollo Theatre in NY and worked with big band leaders like Earl Hines and Billy Eckstine.

In 1943 and 1944, while working with Earl Hines big band, she was brought together with beboppers like Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker and had the opportunity to sing with them. In 1946, she started her solo career. She signed for Columbia Records and recorded pop music between 1949 and 1953. Later, she also produced jazz numbers on the Mercury Records’ subsidiary label, EmArcy.

In the second half of the 1950s, she toured constantly. In 1958, she visited Europe with her trio (pianist Ronnell Bright, bass player Richard Davis and drummer Art Morgan).

Over the years, her voice modulated and deepened a bit, but never lost its magnificence. She mastered the scat singing and remained a popular live performer, touring also in Europe until the end of her career.

Eunice Kathleen Waymon was a prodigious child who played piano by ear at the age of three. She was taught classical music at an early age and soon wanted to pursue a career as a concert pianist to become the first Black female to achieve it. She studied in the Juilliard School in NY and then applied for the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia but the latter denied her admission, turning this event into a key pivotal moment in her life. Nina Simone, the amazing talented storyteller, singer, songwriter, musician, arranger, and fearless civil rights activist was born.

Looking for an income she started to play in a nightclub in Atlantic City (New Jersey) where she was required for the first time to sing. She brilliantly blended Gershwin or Cole Porter famous tunes with jazz, soul and classical melodies. Billie Holiday - and her interpretation of Porgy from Gershwin's Porgy and Bess opera - was an important inspiration for her. In the mid-1960s, when she became a leader in the civil rights movements, along with her famous protest songs like Mississippi Goddam, Four Women, Ain't Got No, I Got Life orTo Be Young, Gifted and Black(named afterLorraine Hansberry), she included Strange Fruit in her repertoire.

Nina recorded for several major record labels but she left the US in 1970 and spent almost a decade in Barbados and Liberia, also living in the 1980s in England, Belgium, France, Switzerland and The Netherlands. It’s at that time when Nina's popularity in Europe rose with My Baby Just Cares For Me. It became a massive hit when it was used by Chanel in a perfume commercial.

In the late 1980s her friend Gerrit de Bruin helped Nina to settle in Nijmegen where she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, properly treated and lived anonymously. She also spent a couple of years in Amsterdam. From 1993 she lived in the South of France, where she passed away from breast cancer in 2003.

Among the many awards and recognitions, she received two honorary degrees in music and humanities, becoming 'Dr. Nina Simone'.

Often disregarded as ‘minor’, the decorative arts have historically been a vivid and diverse space where women could exercise their own creative freedom, steering away from cultural biases.

The decorative arts, especially textile design, weaving and embroidery, allowed women to shape their femininity and actively take part in creative and social discourse. These crafts were a way to re-evaluate the mundane and resist and re-imagine stereotypes.This is what, during the twentieth century, inspired the work of artists likeAnni Albers,Loja Saarinen,Ruth Adler Schnee, andSonia Delaunay.

However, using craft to declare freedom and independence has older and stronger roots and was not reserved to women belonging to the avant-garde circles of Paris or the Bauhaus. Different areas around Europe saw the birth of women’s groups where activities such as weaving and embroidery became a means of expression, and a way to participate in the creative scene of their society.

At the beginning of the 20th Century many workshops led and organised by women sprung up across Italy. These cooperatives were often organised as a reaction to the industrialisation of women's craft products such as lace. Women who had been practising these crafts for over centuries decided they had to organise themselves into larger groups  to promote their work internationally and stand a chance against the mass production and distribution of industrial textiles. The Industrie Femminili Italiane guild was one of these cooperatives, set up with the purpose of safeguarding and promoting the creativity of women’s traditional handicraft.

The Industrie Femminili Italiane was in charge of providing guidelines to other Italian craft schools, among wich the Ars Orobiae school in Bergamo, established in 1903. The Ars Orobiae was described as a group of workers working at home on behalf and under the direction of the Countess Suardi, and practising the reproduction of antique stitches and patterns applied to modern uses.

The “Antonia Suardi Collection”, now conserved in the Museo del Tessuto di Prato, includes over 1.500 pieces of embroidery and lace from the personal collection of the Italian Countess Antonia Ponti Suardi (1860-1938). At the beginning of the Twentieth century, Suardi was one of the main supporters of theIndustrie Femminili Italiane.

Like other noblewomen of her time, Antonia Suardi spent her life constantly putting effort into  research and into the dissemination of the arts of embroidery and lace. Through the teaching of these ancient professions, her school aimed to encourage a new perspective of social emancipation for women. At the same time, the school kept traditional techniques alive that risked disappearing as mechanisation rose in popularity.

TheAntonia Suardi collectiondates from the Sixteenth to the Nineteenth century and includes many differentà jourworks, laces and textiles together with artefacts preserved for educational purposes. These artefacts can be used as study material and as inspiration for current embroidery schools. The collection also includes documents, such as accountability books, receipts and photographs of ancient items, that testify to the educational activity of the school from 1904 to 1930. These samples and photographs of embroidery, accompanied by annotations detailing the names of the ancient patterns, can be considered particularly interesting to reflect on the processes and steps involved in the creation, production and sale of these materials.

These objects are invaluable in reconsidering the conceptual and material meanings of embroidery as an instrument for women to express themselves and fight for freedom and equal rights.Rozsika Parkerargues as much in her bookSubversive Stitch, tracing the relationship between the history of embroidery and the changing notion of femininity and female behaviour from the Middle Ages to the twentieth century.

Parker considers femininity as a 'lived identity' that can be 'accepted or rejected, and believes that 'knowing the history of embroidery is knowing the history of women.' 
Even though embroidery was considered an important art form in the Middle Ages, practised by both men and women, this changed in the nineteenth century. From the nineteenth century onwards,  embroidery was considered specifically feminine, a domestic activity, 'low' in the hierarchy of artistic endeavours.

Embroidery is traditional in the sense that it is repeated in the same way, and is produced with the same tools (needle and thread), even if it always leads to different results. The extraordinary stubbornness of embroidery, its resilience, its capacity to resist any definition demonstrates how the very act of embroidering (as a practice, and therefore as a craft) has played a central role in defining femininity through the centuries, and still does today, thanks tocraftivistcollectives reclaiming the use of embroidery and traditional techniques to ‘materially declare their feminist stances.

Sources and Further Reading

In 1918, British women over the age of 30 with property won the right to vote. It wasn’t until 1928 that women had the same voting rights as men. Though few women of Asian descent were involved in the British suffrage movement and even less those of African descent, most of them were not credited for their participation and crucial role in the movement.

The suffrage movement, for Indian women, was closely linked with their fight for independence against British colonial rule.

Princess Sophia Duleep Singhwas a prominent suffragette in the United Kingdom. 
She was born in London on 8 August 1876 to Bamba Muller, an Egyptian woman of German and Ethiopian descent and Maharaja Duleep Singh, the last Maharaja of the Sikh Empire who was exiled to England.

Sophia joined the Women’s Social and Political Union (WSPU) in 1909 and was an active part of the Women’s Tax Resistance League. They argued that women should not have to pay taxes as they do not get to vote. 
Due to her aristocratic background, she could often get away with not paying taxes, a privilage that other Indian women did not have.

In 1909 Sophia was a leading member of the movement for women’s right to vote and funded various suffragettes groups. Though her primary interest was women’s rights in England, she supported the cause in numerous countries.

Along withEmmeline Pankhurstand other activists, Sophia led one of the suffrage demonstrations in 1910. They went to the House of Commons wanting a meeting with the Prime Minister but were expelled. Many of the women were seriously injured and the incident became known as Black Friday.

Lolita Roywas a social reformer and suffragist born in Calcutta, India in 1865. When she moved to London around 1900, she became active in activist associations for Indians. In 1910 she became president of the London Indian Union Society and played an influential role in the Indian section of the suffrage movement.

In June 1911 there was a suffrage coronation procession through London where some Indian women were invited to take part. Lolita was one of the women and can be seen on the left side of the picture above. The Indian women who participated were often objectified as they were encouraged by the British women to wear saris for the suffrage processions.

Lolita was highly involved in supporting women’s right to vote in India. She petitioned the British government and took part in public speeches in support of the Indian women’s suffrage. 
She also worked with the All-India Women's Conference, a Dehli based NGO tackling women’s rights issues and improving education for women and children.

Cornelia Sorabjiwas a lawyer, writer and social reformer born on 15 November 1866 in Nashik, in the Bombay Presidency, British India.

She was the first woman to graduate from Bombay University and the first woman to study Law at Oxford University. Cornelia was also the first to practice law in India and Britain. She did not directly participate in the suffrage movement, but she advocated for women’s rights as well as the right to vote.

In 1902 she petitioned to the India Office for women to practise law and for women and minors to have female representation in courts. It is said that when women were allowed to practice law in 1923, she represented over 600 women and minors, sometimes doing so at no cost.

Bhikaji Camawas born in Bombay on 24 September 1861 and was a prominent figure in the Indian independence movement. She played an important role in India’s struggle for freedom and women securing equal rights.

Due to her participation in nationalist activities during her stay in London in the early 1900s, she was told that she would be prohibited from returning to India unless she signed a statement promising to refrain from continuing her activities. She refused and decided to relocate to Paris where she co-founded the Indian nationalist organisationParis India Society. Bhikaji would smuggle weekly magazines to Indian activists,funding them and supporting them through her writings.

Bhikaji was also passionate about her support for gender equality. While she was in Egypt in 1910, she stated, 'I see here the representatives of only half the population of Egypt. May I ask where is the other half? Sons of Egypt, where are the daughters of Egypt? Where are your mothers and sisters? Your wives and daughters?'

It is through their travel, correspondence, petitioning, marching, and publishing that a range of Indian suffragettes were able to ensure that Indian women’s rights were not overlooked either in India or other parts of the world.

Stories of women's aspirations, support for one another and hidden power.

The weaving of textiles by the farming communities and townspeople of the historical province of Skåne (or Scania), at the southernmost part of Sweden, has been practised since at least the 16th century. In 1925, Emelie Wilhelmina von Walterstorff (1871-1948) wrote in the opening chapter of her book on the textiles kept at the Nordiska museet, Stockholm: ‘[Textile art] seems to have become instinctive to the Swedish woman and inseparable from the appointments of the Swedish home. During the course of centuries, in which the art has been carried on, certain methods and many characteristic and beautiful designs became traditional’

Weaving as a form of female bonding and passing of knowledge has existed since ancient times, forming a conduit for the lessons, traditions and complex emotions which were allowed to exist in those weaving spaces but not elsewhere. In Fragment 102 of Sappho for instance, the poet writes ‘sweet mother I cannot work the loom/I am broken with longing for a boy by slender Aphrodite’. The passage itself is Sappho’s take on a work song sung by weavers while working over the loom. Along with threads, the stories of these women, their desires, their loves, their power, and their sadness would entwine. Singing and telling of stories would often be involved, and from dawn women would find a space safe for them to feel part of a community, part of the world.

From the middle of the 18th century for almost a hundred years, textiles of exceptional quality were made by the wives, daughters, and maidens of Scania, usually for wedding ceremonies and to be used as covers for cushions, benches, and beds on the special day. Very often these would be woven by the bride-to-be for her dowry chest, and traditional methods of dyeing, weaving, and decorating would be passed on from mother to daughter. And very often, the hopes and dreams of the weavers would be expressed through chosen motifs and patterns.

At the Khalili Collection of Swedish Textiles we have collated close to 100 examples of these unique and personal pieces, each conserved and studied with much care and affection, and over 90 of these have been catalogued in 1996 by the expert art historian Viveka Hansen and published in our catalogueSwedish Textile Art: Traditional Marriage Weaving from Scania. Currently, the Collection holds the largest number of this type of textiles outside of Sweden, and we often plan and work with researchers to find new opportunities to display and study them.

The textile shown below, woven around 1800, is a perfect example of how the occasion and environment would influence the weaving. It is a woven carriage cushion cover, to be used within the carriage as the bride heads to the church, and features a reindeer as well as figures of young women, birds, and no less than seventy-two hearts. The hope for love, the wish for luck and the support of the community are all woven into the cover, making this a piece radiant with promise and aspiration. Unfortunately, as was often the case with these textiles, the pieces are unsigned, and the specific story lost to time.

Textiles like these were usually produced at home on a spinning-wheel and made for the weaver’s own household, although sometimes tapestries would be woven on commission or given as presents. Artificial pigments were not available before 1856, so the remarkable women weaving these were not only experts at techniques of weaving, but also possessed a wealth of knowledge of natural dyes derived from hand-picked plans and their application.

Yellow would often come from apple bark, birch leaves or mignonette — a dye plant which was used by Romans. Red and indigo would be produced from plants such as madder and woad, both of which have been used since ancient times to make those colours. It’s remarkable how abundant and vivid these colours remain today: the dyes in many of these textiles have already survived for centuries. In one of our 18th century carriage cushions, a wonderfully chaotic flood of flowers, birds and people are portrayed in no fewer than seventeen colours.

Undoubtedly, folklore, superstition and stories made their way into these works as well, being a strong influence on the life of the working communities of the time. Sometimes, they even influenced the way the textiles were made: an account by a parish called Fru Alstad, taken down by the Folklore Record Office of the Ethnological Institute in Lund, reads: ‘You could not warp on a Monday, as the weave would not turn out well. When you took down the weave you had to sweep, and no pregnant woman should walk over it, as the baby would then catch a serious disease… No husband should be in the room when the weave was taken down, if so he would not win anything.’

Other times, folk stories and beliefs would make their way into the subjects of the textiles themselves. As well as using the reindeer motif, the weavers would sometimes use mythical creatures such as unicorns and brook horses – figures of Swedish folklore said to lure innocents onto their back and then drown them. Perhaps, as well as visions of love and hope, some of the weavers chose to use these creatures as talismans, or as memento mori (a reminder of mortality), to keep themselves grounded. One of the most powerful objects in the Collection bears precisely this type of depiction. It shows three supernatural horses in an interlocked tapestry dating from 1791, coloured in fiery reds. Unlike most of these textiles, this one bears the initials ‘MPD’ and ‘IHS’, however the identities of these individuals remains unknown.

Finally, let’s look at a textile which could be seen as encompassing all the traditions and motifs mentioned, and which is resplendent in its colour and detail. It is another signed piece, bearing the initials STDR and was made during the first half of the 19th century. In the centre are six octagons. In the four outer octagons, figures are gathered around a large horse with an elegant rider on their back. The rider’s clothes are done in such minute detail, that even the French knots on their coat buttons are visible. And right in the centre, in the two largest octagons, six splendidly dressed  women stand around a large and ornate tree, three on each side, while birds fly above. The power and presence of the women, celebrating the intended recipient of this textile, tells the story of their aspirations, support for one another, and hidden power.

What was Raffaella Carrà's early life?

How did Raffaella Carrà become popular?

How Raffaella Carrà broke boundaries

Raffaella Carrà in later years

Dancer, singer, television star and diva

Raffaella Carrà was a legendary Italian pop singer, actress, dancer and television presenter.

She was beloved in her home country Italy, as well as in Spain and other European countries and across Latin America. Her songA far l'amore comincia tu- known in English asDo it, Do it Again- was a hit in several countries, and was translated into several languages including Spanish, German, French and English.

She was so popular in Italy that, in 1984, a magazine described her as: 'More applauded than [president] Pertini, more expensive than [footballer] Michel Platini, more miraculous than [saint] Padre Pio.'

Born in Bologna in 1943, as Raffaella Pelloni, her talent emerged young.

Aged just 8 years old, she moved to Rome to study at the National Academy of Dance. There, she also began classes at the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia (Italian National film school), graduating in 1960.

In the early 1960s, she appeared in many Italian 'sword and sandal' films (a genre known as peplum), as well as comedies and action films.

In 1965, Raffaella Carrà moved to Hollywood. Following Federico Fellini's 1960 filmLa Dolce Vita, many Italian actors were popular, such as Sophia Loren and Gina Lollobrigida.

Raffaella Carrà had roles in some films and television shows, but did not like living in Los Angeles and felt homesick. Thus, one year later, she returned toItalywhere she featured in films and television series. This led to her success on Italian television.

Through the 1970s, she presented popular Saturday night entertainment shows on Italian television, in which she performed a variety of songs, and danced to show-tunes with highly choreographed show tunes.

She became a well-known and loved personality.

Later she began to also host shows on television inSpain.

Riding the disco wave of the late 1970s, she focused on music and released a number of albums. Her 1976 albumForte forte fortewas released in 36 countries. Her follow-upFiestawas released just one year later. Over her long career, she released 25 albums in all.

It's this era of her career for which Raffaella is best remembered. Her sweet melodious singing, enthusiastic and effortless dancing - all high kicks and head flicks - her trademark blond bob, her glamour and style all combine to make her a beloved Italian diva.

Take a moment to watch her performances, they will not fail to make you smile.

In 1971, while performing her songTuca Tuca, she wore clothing which revealed her belly button. This was seen as scandalous and provocative in Catholic, conservative Italy.

Her 1976 hit songA far l'amore comincia tuurged women to take control during sex, and thus Raffaella Carrà became an icon of women's liberation.

She was also a defender of worker's rights and a supporter of theLGBTQ+ communityin Italy. These qualities, along with her excellent talents and skills, made Raffaella Carrà the icon that she was.

Into the 1980s, Raffaella Carrà continued to present many successful shows on Italian and Spanish television. She hosted the first day-time talk-show in Italy, a format that became popular in that decade. More than 14 million viewers tuned in to watch her interview Mother Teresa of Calcutta.

In 1983, she hosted the popularSanremo Music Festival, the show which inspired the Eurovision Song Contest.

This television success continued through the 1990s and into the 2000s. She remained close to theEurovision Song Contest, presenting a selection show in Spain in 2008 and commentating for Italian television in 2011.

In 2021, Italy won the Eurovision Song Contest for the first time in 30 years. Some months later, Italian TV revealed plans for the legendary Italian television icon to present the show in 2022.

Sadly, this was not to be, as Raffaella Carrà died in Rome on 5 July 2021, at the age of 78.

Thousands lined the streets of Italian cities to mourn Raffaella Carrà as her funeral was broadcast live on TV, remembering her as someone representing freedom whose music lifted the soul and brought sweet smiles.

Tina Blau - born on 15 November 1845 in Vienna - was one of the most important landscape painters in Austria. She belongs to the Austrian art style 'Stimmungsimpressionisten' (maybe translated as 'Atmospheric Impressionism'), a term describing the focus of her chosen artistic motifs on landscape and still-life painting.

She became interested in painting at a very early age and was inspired throughout her life by the landscapes around Vienna, especially the Vienna Prater park and its environs.

Tina Blau was born in times of upheaval. The uprisings of the revolutionary year 1848 - which demanded freedom for press, speech and expression - followed three years after her birth. The revolution was bloodily crushed, but some demands were implemented and brought some changes – not with immediate effect, but over time.These changes and adaptations to the catalogue of wishes of the revolutionary forces primarily affected the realities of life for men. Women's rights were at best peripherally thought of during this time, so the challenges in Tina Blau's life read like a sign of the times at many crucial moments. Women were excluded from independent public life until the beginning of the 20th century. Women were not able to choose a course of study, rent a studio, marry among different denominations, make economic decisions or participate politically or be members in political associations.

Tina Blau was a pioneer in many aspects of the visual arts for women in Austria.

Her father Simon Blau was a military doctor from Prague, living and working in the Heumarkt barracks in Vienna's third district. He had once flirted with pursuing an artistic profession himself, and recognised his daughter's talent early on and gave her substantial and ongoing support. As women were not yet allowed to consider studying art at an academy in the mid-19th century, her father encouraged her at the age of 15 with private lessons from the landscape painter August Schäffer and later from the portraitist Josef Aigner. She received her first lessons from the Waldmüller pupil Antal Hanély, and her first still lifes were also painted under his eye.

When her father took her on a trip north of Prague to Brandeis on the Elbe, she created her first landscape paintings, standing in open nature and fresh air, her subject before her eyes. This influenced her approach to painting and to nature, her preferred place to paint.

She first participated in an exhibition in 1867 thanks to the initiative of her teacher Josef Aigner. He urged her to exhibit a painting at the Vienna Kunstverein, which earned her very first positive reviews.

In 1869, at the age of 24, she moved to Munich to pursue a more in-depth education at the Art School for Women. She took private lessons with Professor Wilhelm Lindenschmit the Younger. As a result, she produced several works and had her first sales, such as the painting Jakobsee bei Polling.

The sale of her paintings allowed her to pay for travel. Sometimes she was able to sell another painting during a stay on one of her trips and thus extend her stay.

During these years, she met the painter Emil Jakob Schindler. They became friends and visited  Hungary and other countries together. After their travels, they founded their studio community in Vienna. Since she could not enter into a tenancy herself, the studio community was 'sold'  to the outside world as a teacher-pupil relationship. She resisted the idea that she had been a pupil of Schindler's, a claim that is still sometimes made today.

In 1874, Tina Blau moved into her own studio in the Vienna Prater, in one of the rotundas left behind by the 1873 World's Fair.

Using the frame of a pram and a larger wicker basket, she formed her 'Malwagerl', a mobile painting set with an easel as a storage space for brushes, paints, whole pallets and other utensils, and went out with it into the surrounding nature of the Vienna Prater.

Der Stimmungsimpressionismus was characterised by open-air drawings. Using much larger formats than usual, she created such works as Prater im Frühling (Prater in Spring), an oil on canvas that measured 2x3 metres.

This painting was initially classified by the jury of the Künstlerhaus as 'not hangable', with the comment that 'it would tear a hole in the exhibition wall'. The commission responsible reacted to the atypical brightness of her painting and initially rejected it. Thanks to the intervention of Hans Makart, the picture was admitted after all.

In Austria at the time, there were a number of special exhibitions and movements aiming to promote Viennese and Austrian artists at a time when France and Germany set the tone in the visual arts.  Almost 250,000 people visited Vienna's First International Art Exhibition in 1882.

Antonin Proust, France's Minister of the 'Beaux-Arts' (this title corresponds to today's term for Minister of Culture) invited Tina Blau to the Paris Salon with her painting 'Frühling im Prater' where she was awarded a Prix Honorable. This event also marked her international breakthrough.

During her stay in Paris, she created several paintings of the Tuileries Gardens.

In 1883, not yet 40 years old, but unusually late for those times, she became engaged to Heinrich Lang - a battle scene and horse painter - and moved with him to Munich, where they married at the end of December 1883. Tina Blau was Jewish, Heinrich Lang was Protestant. A ban on 'mixed marriages' applied then, so she decided to convert to Protestantism.

After her marriage, Tina Blau began teaching as a teacher in the painting school of the Künstlerinnenverein in Munich, which had been founded in 1882 to give women engaged in the arts and crafts the opportunity for mutual stimulation in their work and mutual support in their endeavours. Later, she taught landscape and still life painting there.

In the 1880s and 1890s, her works were shown at world exhibitions - such as the World Exhibition in Paris in 1889 and the Chicago in 1892 - and many other galleries and exhibitions. She enjoys success and recognition. The Munich Kunstverein organised her first solo exhibition with more than 60 works in 1890.

When her husband died in 1891, she moved back to Vienna after several journeys that took her as far as Holland and Italy. With the leadership of Olga Prager and together with Rosa Mayreder in 1897, she founded the Vienna Women's Academy, an artistic educational institution in Vienna which enabled women interested in painting, graphics and sculpture to receive an education without expensive private lessons. Tina Blau taught Landscape Painting and Still Life classes there from 1898 to 1915.

Tina Blau set the course for women in the artistic landscape and painting and was one of the most important Austrian painters of the 19th century. Tina Blau died of cardiac arrest in Vienna in 1916 after a prolonged illness.

Sources and further reading

Rosalba Carriera is remembered as one of the most successful women artists ever, with her painting techniques and subjects receiving praise and attention.

This blog will look at her career from the perspective of her as an independent and  successful artist in a profession and society that, at the time, were predominantly male-dominated and male-oriented.

From this premise you probably guessed it was no easy task, so here is an example of how  women often receive less recognition than men.

Palazzo Goldoni is a baroque style Venetian house located in Chioggia, a town at the very south of the Venetian lagoon. Throughout the centuries, its name changed many times, such as Palazzo Poli, Poli-Smeraldi, and most recently, Palazzo Goldoni.

While the first two listed names refer to the families who owned it, the Goldoni family were not its owners. Carlo Goldoni, a very important figure in Italian theatre, sojourned at the palace with his family, and the palace was named after him. However, Rosalba Carriera's family owned the palace, and yet it does not bear her name.

That’s because, in Italy, she is not as well known as Carlo Goldoni. His claim to fame was revolutionising Italian theatre. Rosalba herself was no less a revolutionary figure.

Rosalba Carriera was born on 7 October 1675 in Venice.

In that time, the power and influence of the once great Venice had been in decline for quite some time. However, it remained an inevitable stop for young men in their Grand Tours of Europe, and it was still quite diplomatically relevant, with the hustle and bustle of diplomats. Rosalba knew quite a number of people in the latter category, who paved the way for her stay inFranceand made her famous across  Europe.

At the time, when women were 15 or 16 years old, they began to already receive engagement proposals, especially those in the middle and upper classes. Rosalba was the eldest of three sisters, so, around that age, she began to have several suitors.

Women of the upper and middle classes usually only had two choices in life: to get married or to become a nun.

Because so many people from so many different backgrounds lived in Venice, people were generally more open-minded than other places in Europe at the time. Women were more present in everyday life, but this presence was not publicly acknowledged.

Rosalba’s grandfather was also an artist. Her parents were happy that she also had a talent for art, so they encouraged her to pursue her passion for drawing. They were part of the middle class, and could afford to provide an education for their three daughters. The education consisted in reading, writing, French, English, poetry and music.

The painter Giuseppe Diamantini took Rosalba in as his apprentice in his workshop. He treated her like any other apprentice, like her male peers.

She especially enjoyed preparing colours and drawing portraits. Rosalba wrote a  manuscript about colour preparation, which is now held at the National Archive in Venice, and has beenpublished.

In Diamantini’s workshop, Rosalba increasingly developed her talents. His clients gradually became hers. Her family and family friends also started commissioning works from her. She started earning her own money.

Thanks to her connections with diplomats and high-ranking people fromItalyand all over Europe (especially France, England, and Germany), she received many important commissions of portraits and other subjects, which spread her fame to many corners of the continent.

Because she received many commissions, she would personally draw the composition and leave portions of the work to her staff at the workshop or to her sister Zanina. She accompanied Rosalba in all her travels and was of great help in her sister’s career.

Her diaries and memoirs of the time tell stories of daily life from the perspective of a person whose combination of gender and profession were uncommon. They give us glimpses into daily life, but also into the most significant events of the time period through the eyes of a person who lived in the arts.

Rosalba also left testimonies of what she knew was expected of her as a woman in the 1600s and 1700s, and of how she reconciled them with what was typically expected of (male) painters in that same time period. Her talent and perseverance make her a revolutionary figure in the history of women in art, and in the history of art in general.

Rosalba died on 15 April 1757 in Venice.

French can-can dancer at the famed Moulin Rouge in Paris

La Goulue was a French can-can dancer who was the star of the Moulin Rouge cabaret in Paris.

Born Louise Weber in 1866, her family were Jewish and from Alsace. They eventually moved to Paris. Aged 16, Louise was working in a laundry but sneaking to dance halls and balls behind her family's back.

She quickly became popular for dancing in clubs aroundParis, particularly in the suburbs - both for her dancing skills as well as her cheeky and audacious behaviour.

She got her nicknameLa Goulue- 'the Glutton' - because of her habit of finishing customers' drinks as she danced past their tables.

She soon attracted the attention of the owners of the Moulin Rouge, where she made her debut in 1891. She performed a dance like the can-can called thechahutwith Jules Renaudin, a former dancer who had become a wine merchant. While both were popular figures in the club, La Goulue stole the show.

She became the permanent headliner of the club and became famous as the can-can dancer from the Moulin Rouge. She featured on many posters and memorabilia for the club, as well as being immortalised by artists such asToulouse Lautrec.

In 1895, having achieved fame and fortune at the Moulin Rouge, La Goulue decided to leave the club and go solo.

She decided to invest her money in a travelling fairground, where she worked as a lion tamer, amongst other things. But her new entertainment form was not as popular as her dancing and was soon closed. She then disappeared from the public eye, continuing to work in carnivals as an animal tamer.

Later in life, in Montmartre, she sells peanuts, cigarettes and matches on street corners and outside theatres.

Although her physical appearance had changed greatly, she is still recognised and respected by Parisians as La Goulue, the queen of the Moulin Rouge.

La Goulue Louise Weber died in 1928, aged 62. She was first buried in the Cimetière de Pantin, but later her remains were transferred to the Cimetière de Montmartre.

One of the finest ballerinas of the Romantic era

Fanny Elssler was a world-famous Austrian ballerina in the 19th century. She danced on stages across Europe and beyond. In the 1840s, she was the first European female artist to go on tour through North America and Cuba.

Fanny Elssler was born in 1810 in a neighbourhood of Vienna. Her father worked in the court of the nobility, and eventually became a valet to the composer Franz Joseph Haydn. Fanny and her sister Therese began dancing at a young age - Fanny's first stage performance was at Vienna's Kärntnertortheater before she was seven years old.

Both sisters studied dancing in Vienna and, in 1827, their dance education brought them to Naples.

While there, Fanny became pregnant and returned to Vienna. The child's father is believed to be Leopold, Prince of Salerno (the son of King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies). She gave birth to a son, Franz, who was fostered and grew up in Eisenstadt, a small city outside Vienna.

Before her pregnancy, Fanny's dancing performances made her a success in Naples. This led to her being offered roles in Berlin which she took up in 1830.

The year previously, she had met Friedrich von Gentz, a German diplomat and writer. He was 46 years older than Fanny and infuated with her. He showered her with gifts, and became a mentor to her. She lived with him until his death in 1832. In 1833, Fanny had another child. Her daughter Therese was born in London was again adopted, by the family of a British member of parliament.

In 1834, Fanny began the pinnacle of her career, dancing at the Paris Opéra. There she was placed in competition against Swedish ballerina Marie Taglioni, one of the most celebrated ballerinas of the era. Both were very accomplished dancers, but with different styles. The Opéra management played up their rivalry.

As a newcomer to the Paris Opéra, Fanny brought a different stlye of dancing - more precise and sensual. She introduced theatricalised folk dance styles into ballet. Fanny's performance of a Spanish danceCachuchawas a sensation. Its success led to a fashion for more choreographed ballet dances with specific national flavours and styles. She danced at the Paris Opéra until 1840.

Between 1840 and 1842, Fanny toured the United States, earning enormous sums and rave reviews. She had broken her contract with the Paris Opéra in order to extend her American tour and thus could not return there afterwards, but she danced with continuing success in England, Germany, Italy and Russia until her retirement in 1851.

She settled into private life, living first in Hamburg and later in Vienna, where she died in 1884 aged 74.

Her passion for revolution and justice sent shockwaves through German society

Rosa Luxemburg seemed to have a lot going against her at the start of her life. Born into a lower-middle-class Polish Jewish family in 1871, a hip problem at the age of five left Rosa with a permanent limp. Besides her physical disability, Rosa grew up when Poland was still part of the Russian empire, surrounded by those who wanted to Russify the Poles on one side and those who fought for Polish independence on the other.

Her parents instilled a deep sense of Polish nationalism in Rosa. She took this with her to school where she secretly attended meetings of Polish writers and poets that used the Polish language, which was forbidden at the time. Rosa joined the also illegal Polish Proletariat Party at the age of 15. She helped organise a general strike, which was met with a bloody suppression from the Tsarist regime: four of the Proletariat Party leaders were put to death.

From a very early age, Rosa had a deep revulsion for humans' inhumanity to other humans. For her, this went along with a deep love for humanity itself, fascinated by natural science and art as well as politics. At sixteen, she wrote:

My ideal is a social system that allows one to love everybody with a clear conscience.

Rosa's political activism made her a wanted woman, so she fled to Switzerland in 1889, aged just 18, where she started studying and became the first Polish woman with a doctorate degree in Economics. In 1898, she moved back to Poland and co-founded the Polish Marxist political partySDKPiL.  That same year, she had to flee Poland once more, moving to Germany, where she quickly rose through the ranks of the Social-Political Democrat party (SPD). Rosa became known for her inflammatory speeches which always succeeded in agitating the crowd.

During her studies in Zürich she met Polish revolutionary Leo Jogiches,
a young man dedicated to the anti-Tsarist movement. They started an intense and long-lasting relationship, but marrying Jogiches, an underground activist using six different names, was never an option. Nevertheless Rosa enjoyed an active love life wich was considered highly provocative at that time. She and Jogiches split in 1907, and Rosa went on to be in relationships with Clara Zetkin’s son Kostja, and Paul Levi.

Most of her ire was focused on Eduard Bernstein, one of the leading SPD thinkers. Bernstein aimed to re-route the SPD by positing that it should work towards social reform within a capitalist society instead of calling for a revolution and toppling of capitalism. One of Rosa's most famous pieces of writings is the pamphlet called 'Social Reform or Revolution?' where she refutes Bernstein's argument point by point.

This put Luxemburg firmly in the camp of the militant revolutionaries of the SPD, with Bernstein leading the revisionist, reformist faction on the other side. Their discussions and writings would become known as The Bernstein Debate.

Rosa was a prolific writer. She wrote hundreds of letters, pamphlets and magazines in her life. Some of her more well-known writings connect the scourge of capitalism with imperialism and colonialism.

A look around us at this moment shows what the regression of bourgeois society into barbarism means. This world war is a regression into barbarism. The triumph of imperialism leads to the annihilation of civilization.Rosa Luxemburg, the Junius Pamphlet, 1916

Rosa was deeply convinced that emancipation and women suffrage could only be realized as part of a proletarian revolution, as she pointed out in her text „Women suffrage and class struggle“ (1912). This is why she mistrusted the bourgeois women's suffragette movement.

From 1900 onwards, feeling the onset of war, Rosa's writings unceremoniously attacked German imperialism, nationalism and militarism. When World War I  did break out in 1914, however, the SPD voted in favour of financing the war and taking up arms. This was hugely demoralising for Luxemburg, who saw that the revisionist side of the SPD had triumphed.

In response to the outbreak of the war, Rosa co-foundedDie Internationaletogether with, among others, Karl Liebknecht and Clara Zetkin. The group would later become known asThe Spartacus League.

The group wrote illegal anti-war pamphlets under pseudonyms, opposing the SPD's pro-war efforts, calling for general strikes and proletariat uprisings. Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg were imprisoned for their illegal writings for two and a half years in 1916, although they kept on writing and publishing from jail.

Rosa and Liebknecht were freed from prison on 8 November 1918, three days before the end of the war. She and Liebknecht founded the Communist Party of Germany (KPD).

The KPD ended up boycotting the elections that would lead to the founding of the Weimar Republic in 1918. In January 1919, another wave of revolution swept through Berlin, and Luxemburg and Liebknecht called on their KPD comrades to overthrow the Weimar government so that a truly left-wing Marxist revolution could take place.

The revolution failed, and Liebknecht and Rosa were captured on 15 January 1919 by paramilitaries under the command of the SPD chancellor Friedrich Ebert. Luxemburg and Liebknecht were both shot dead on the spot, Rosa's body was thrown in the canal and Liebknecht's corpse was sent to the morgue.

The murder of Rosa and Karl re-ignited the communist revolution: four months of bloody upheaval and subsequent oppression followed. Rosa's body was later found and buried, together with Liebknecht, in Friedrichsfelde Central Cemetery.

Rosa Luxemburg's testament to social history is one of vehemence, of utter commitment to the cause of worker liberation and a social system of democracy, of conviction that capitalism can only be overthrown through revolution. At the heart of Rosa Luxemburg's activism, however, there always was a core of humanism, a love of humanity. Her struggle had always been to make all humans live better lives, which she worked towards with every fibre of her being.

Being human means throwing your whole life on the scales of destiny when need be, all the while rejoicing in every sunny day and every beautiful cloud.

Who was Kathleen McKane Godfree?

What tennis championships did Kitty McKane win?

What was Kitty McKane's family life?

Who was the first tennis player to win five Olympic medals?

Tennis has been a part of the Olympic Games since the first championships in 1896, albeit with a large break for more than 60 years while the definition of an amateur player was debated.

In all this time, there are only two tennis players to have won five Olympic medals: Venus Williams and Kathleen ('Kitty') McKane Godfree. Venus Williams' four gold and one silver Olympic medals add to her many Grand Slam titles, confirming her as one of the greatest tennis players of all time.

However, Kathleen McKane Godfree - who played in the 1920s - may be less well remembered today.

Born in 1896 in London, Kitty McKane learned to play tennis at Saint Leonard's School inScotland.

She made her competitive debut in a tournament in Roehampton in April 1919 and, just a few weeks later, reached the quarter-finals at Wimbledon. She soon became Britain's number one player.

In the1920 Olympic Games in Antwerp, she won a gold, silver and bronze medal in the Doubles, Mixed Doubles and Singles competitions respectively.

The 1920s continued with great sporting success for McKane.

She wonWimbledonsingles titles in 1924 and 1926, as well as reaching the finals of the French Open in 1923 and 1925 and the US Open Final in 1925. That year, she became the first person to reach the finals of the French, Wimbledon and US championships.

As a doubles player, she won the US Open in 1923, 1925 and 1927, and Wimbledon titles in 1924 and 1926. She was also a finalist in the French Open three times.

She won a silver and bronze medal at the1924 Olympic Games in Paris, in both the Singles and Doubles competitions (with Phyllis Covell).

In addition to tennis, McKane was also a successful badminton player, winning eight singles and doubles in the All England Open Badminton Championships in the 1920s.

In 1926, McKane married Leslie Godfree. That year, they became the only married couple to have ever won the mixed doubles championship at Wimbledon. In keeping with this family theme, four years earlier, in 1922, Kitty and her sister Margaret McKane Stocks became the first pair of sisters to play in a Wimbledon doubles final.

McKane reached a career high ranking of number two in the world several times in the 1920s. In 1978, she was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame, and presented the Wimbledon winner's trophy to Martina Navratilova in 1986. Kathleen McKane Godfree died on 19 June 1992, aged 96.

Books with (and without) pictures

Advertising is not a feature of modern times. Diebold Lauber, a 15th century scribe from the Alsace region, advertised his products in several manuscripts from his own workshop, such as the one below:

Item zu hagenowe vil hübscher buechere geistlich oder weltlich hübsch gemolt bỳ diebolt louber schriber vnd guote latinsche buechere

[At Hagenau there are fine religious and secular books (both beautiful illustrated) by the scribe Diebold Lauber, as well as very good books in latin].

Who is this man Diebold Lauber? Very little is known about him and his workshop. Based on the surviving manuscripts associated with him, Diebold Lauber was a medieval scribe, who lived in Hagenau (today Haguenau, France). He may also have worked as a scribe for the landvogt (governor) of Hagenau. We don’t know for sure.

However, we are pretty sure that he taught children. Another advertising entry says:dypold lauber schreyber lert die kinder[the scribe Diebold Lauber teaches children]. We know that he provided and delivered manuscripts as a dealer. Evidence suggests that he was even the head of a workshop with almost 80 preserved manuscripts ascribed to it. Such a large number of books, combined with their numerous illustrations, would not have been manageable for a single person so it is assumed that he had different scribes and illustrators working with him.
The manuscripts of the Lauber workshop are famous for their almost standardised layout. Beautiful illustrations of vernacular texts are one of their outstanding features.

The Alsace region was a prosperous region in the late Middle Ages with central cities such as Straßburg, Colmar and Hagenau. In the midst of this cultural boom, the spread of secular and religious literature also grew in importance. Before the invention of printing, books could only be copied by hand. In the late Middle Ages, writing workshops were common in every city. But few have written such beautiful illustrated manuscripts of vernacular texts as Diebold Lauber and his workshop. Representative books of this kind and this size could only be bought by the upper class: noblemen and wealthy city residents.

The workshop of Diebold Lauber produced manuscripts between 1427 and around 1470. It offered work to different scribes and illustrators. Lauber’s workshop may also have had connections with a former workshop in Straßburg or Colmar that copied manuscripts from 1418–1430 (known as the Alsatian Workshop of 1418). The manuscripts created in this workshop and those created in Diebold Lauber’s workshop show great similarities both in the layout and in the style of the illustrations. It is believed that scribes and / or illustrators may have worked first for one workshop and then for the other. However, as would later become the case in the first printing workshops, the codices in the Lauber workshop were not only copied on demand, but manuscripts were produced in order to have them in stock. The customers could later select and purchase one (or even more) of these manuscripts.

In another advertisement, we get to know the kind of manuscripts which were offered.

Text (fol. 4r):

Item zü hagenow py dypold lauber schreyber lert die kinder sind die buecher tütsch Item gesta romanorum gemault Item parcifal gemault Item floyr und blantscheflur gemault […] Item Troyen gemault …

(transcription by Saurma-Jeltsch 2001, Vol. 1, p. 240f.)

[At Hagenau the scribe Diebold Lauber – who teaches children as well – offers these books in German: ‘Gesta Romanorum’ with illustrations, ‘Parcifal’ with illustrations, ‘Flore and Blanscheflur’ with illustrations (…) ‘Troy’ with illustrations …]

In addition to some religious books (such as saint’s legends), this list includes vernacular romances. Many classics of German courtly literature can be found, such as ‘Tristan’ (by Gottfried von Straßburg), ‘Parzival’ and ‘Willehalm’ (both by Wolfram von Eschenbach), ‘The Trojan War’ (by Konrad von Würzburg) or ‘Wigalois’ (by Wirnt von Gravenberg).

Among the five manuscripts of Lauber’s workshop at Berlin State Library there are two secular texts mentioned in the list above: a courtly romance by Konrad von Würzburg (‘The Trojan War’/’Trojanerkrieg’) and a courtly romance by Konrad Fleck (‘Flore and Blanscheflur’). While the first manuscript was written around 1445, the second manuscript was written around 1465.

The older manuscript features a courtly romance by Konrad von Würzburg (‘The Trojan War’) and a continuation. The 13th century author Konrad von Würzburg (c. 1225–1287) is one of the most important authors of vernacular literature in his time. His patrons were members of the upper class in Basel and Straßburg, the two most important cities of the upper Rhine region of the 13th century. His ‘Trojan War’ is in every case his magnum opus. Even unfinished, it consists of more than 40,000 verses. More than 160 years later, his works were still in great demand. Beside the Berlin manuscript of ‘The Trojan War’ there are two other manuscripts from Lauber’s workshop in that period that have survived the centuries: Würzburg, UB, M.ch.f.24 (c. 1445) and Zeil bei Leutkirch, Fürstlich Waldburg Zeil’sches Gesamtarchiv, ZAMs 37 (c. 1446/47). This suggests that the Lauber workshop not only produced manuscripts that had been commissioned, but also copied manuscripts for stock to have different titles ready for potential buyers.

The Berlin State Library’s copy dates around 1445 - the heyday of Lauber’s workshop - and shows several typical features of the manuscripts produced there. It is unusually large for a vernacular manuscript (41.5 cm × 28.5 cm) and it is written on high quality paper. The text is richly illustrated. It contains an index at the very beginning of the manuscript and offers picture headings. As is often seen in the manuscripts of the Lauber workshop, at the start of the romance text, there is an illustration followed by a page with a big, colourful initial.

The other Lauber manuscript already mentioned –‘Flore and Blanscheflur’ by Konrad Fleck – was written around 1465, during the last decade of the workshop. It is still a manuscript on paper, but of smaller size than the first example (28.5 cm × 21.0 cm). The most striking feature of this manuscript, however, is that it features spaces for but does not contain any illustrations.

Even though this manuscript contains the complete text, it remains unfinished due to the lack of illustrations. There are spaces for the illustrations and explanations to accompany the pictures are written with red ink. Obviously, however, this manuscript did not receive any additional decoration. Though incomplete, it is a good example of how illustrated books were made in the Middle Ages. The text was copied first, and spaces were left on the pages for illustrations and / or for initials, which were only inserted after the text copy had been completed. It can be assumed that the production of handwritten copies came under massive economic pressure due to the emerging book printing. 15th century book printing was still expensive, but was a cheaper alternative to handwritten books. This may be the reason why there are no illustrations in this copy of ‘Flore and Blanscheflur’ from around 1465 – in contrast to the previously mentioned older advertisement that offered: “Flore and Blanscheflur with illustrations”.

In this way, the manuscripts of the Lauber workshop show two things: on the one hand, we can see that there was a high level of craftsmanship in late medieval book production which demonstrates the importance and value placed on vernacular literature in the 15th century. On the other hand, the manuscripts of the Lauber workshop also bear witness to the transition from a culture of manuscripts to a culture of printed books during the 15th century.

Who was Masterji?

How Masterji's photography documents post-war migration to Coventry

Maganbhai Patel - more widely known as Masterji - was a photographer with a career spanning seven decades. His photographs and portraits taken between the 1950s and the 2000s, charting the South Asian community in Coventry and the West Midlands.

His photography came to wider attention in 2016 when, at the age of 94, he received his first solo exhibition in his adoptive home cityCoventry, as part of the city’s bid to becomeUK City of Culture.

Now, the largest ever exhibition of his work has just opened atCompton Verney- a Georgian mansion and museum in Warwickshire - in a comprehensive survey of his career. The images provide an important socio-historic record of people from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh settling in to a new country and establishing themselves over successive generations.

Masterji was already a well-known figure in Coventry, not least as its first Indian photographer. Patel was born in South Gujarat and moved to England in the early 1950s.

His route into photography began in 1951, when he took a job at Coventry’s General Electric factory and joined the firm’s photographic society. He saved up to buy a Kodak Box Brownie camera and, as word of his obvious skills behind the lens spread, he soon found himself in demand for weddings and other social events.

In 1969, he opened the appropriately named Master’s Art Studio, with his portrait photographs continuing to create brilliantly evocative records of people moving to the West Midlands from South Asia and making it their home.

Early works – predominantly black and white portraits of young men – document the pioneers who came to post-war Coventry to find work and helped to rebuild the city, while the later photographs document a community becoming less transitory and more established in the city, with increasing numbers of family portraits commissioned to mark significant occasions such as weddings.

The works also capture changes in fashion across the decades, at the same time illustrating the development of photography as a medium from the heyday of film to the dawn of digital.

The studio’s success was also thanks to the work of Masterji’s wife Ramaben Patel, who was instrumental in developing many of the photographs and interacting with customers. A photographer herself, Ramaben took many intimate family photographs and also taught her children to take photos.

Another aspect of his work was to take portraits that would be sent back home. In some cases, there is a sense of artistry or future ambition, as Masterji and his subjects collaborated to create their own images of success.

Gordonbhai Bhakta cuts a playful dash, as he reclines on a small table, smiling and with an air of a movie star larking about during a studio shoot.

Masterji enjoyed a uniquely close relationship with his sitters – his experiences mirrored theirs and there was no sense of formality in his studio. As a photographer he was known for his charm and his ability to put his sitters at ease.

The bond he shared with his sitters, combined with his sensitivity, resulted in portraits which are characterful and revealing.

In 2017, Masterji launched his first book and received an Honorary Doctor of Arts (DArts) from Coventry University, in recognition for his outstanding contribution to photography and the heritage of the city.

Masterji’s story is as relevant in the present moment as ever, as questions of identity and migration continue to dominate discourses nationally and internationally.

Exploring the archive of an influential priest and professor

Titus Brandsma was a very important figure in Dutch history: a Carmelite friar, priest, publicist, and professor.

Now, thanks to agrantfrom Archives Portal Europe and Europeana, items from his family archive are available toview on Europeanaas well as having a full archival catalogue available to search onArchives Portal Europe.

The archive contains 2.5 metres of letters and postcards from Brandsma to his family, as well as photos, poetry, publications and other valuable documents. The archive was originally gifted to the Stichting Archief- en Documentatiecentrum voor R.K. Friesland by descendants of Brandsma's sister Gatske de Boer-Brandsma, and grew over time.

Titus Brandsma was born Anno Sjoerd Brandsma in a hamlet called Ugoklooster in the Friesland province of the Netherlands on 23 February 1881. His parents were dairy farmers, and devout, committed Catholics. Most of Brandsma's siblings entered religious orders in their adulthood.

In 1898, Brandsma entered the Carmelite monastery, taking religious vows a year later along with the religious name Titus, in honour of his father. He was ordained a priest in 1903. He devoted the next decades to studying, writing and teaching.

Brandsma was one of the founders of the Catholic University of Nijmegen (now Radboud University). From 1923 until his death, he was the Professor in Philosophy & History of Piety there, as well as being the university's rector in the early 1930s.

As advisor to the Nederlandsche Rooms-Katholieke Journalistenvereeniging (Dutch Roman-Catholic Journalists Association), Brandsma played a role in the modernisation of Catholic newspaper press, and improving the working conditions of Catholic journalists. He also championed Frisian causes, such as the emancipation of Frisian Catholics and conserving Frisian heritage.

Furthermore, he was an important thinker in Carmelite mysticism, and his collection of copies of medieval mystical manuscripts led to the foundation of the Titus Brandsma Institute.

Through the early 20th century, he travelled widely - both in the Netherlands and abroad - sending letters and postcards to his family, many of which are preserved in the archive. Among other destinations, postcards from Ireland, Italy, Switzerland and the USA feature.

In 1939, Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands knighted Brandsma in the Orde van de Nederlandse Leeuw (Order of the Dutch Lion) for his altruistic achievements.

Before and during World War II, Brandsma was an influential critic of National Socialism and racism. He resisted the expulsion of Jewish students from Catholic schools. In 1942, the Nazi-regime arrested him for his criticisms and he was transported to the Dachau concentration camp, where he died from a lethal injection following a period of abuse and sickness, on 26 July 1942.

Pope John Paul II beatified Brandsma in 1985, as a martyr of the faith. His feast day is observed within the Carmelite Order on 27 July. In 2005, people living in Nijmegen chose Brandsma as the greatest citizen to have lived in the city.

The archive now made available both on Europeana andArchives Portal Europeshows a unique private side to the public figure Brandsma, and in his letters and postcards, we see a committed family member. This archive - which was previously only visible to researchers visiting the archive in person - can now be explored, studied and enjoyed digitally.

Join eight show-and-tell sessions with unique artefacts in the reading room of the Leiden University Library

Medieval manuscripts were collected and read for the texts they contained, especially those surviving from classical antiquity. But the book can tell us so much more than solely the text it contains! Studying the materiality of books can provide important information about how, when, where and even why they were made. It can also show how books were used and valued during the many centuries of their existence.

Dr Irene O’Daly (Book and Digital Media Studies, Leiden University) teaches her students about the contents and materiality of medieval manuscript books. During her courses, she frequently brings her students to the University Library, where she shows and discusses interesting items selected from its rich collections.

Leiden University Libraries, a partner of the Art of Reading in the Middle Ages project, invited Dr O’Daly to participate in a video series, introducing a wider audience to the fascinating world of the medieval manuscript book. This collaboration resulted in eight short videos, recorded in the Library’s Special Collections Reading Room. O’Daly presents the materiality of the codex from different angles, such as script, lay-out, traces of scribes and users. 
Every book she shows is made available as a digital facsimile by Leiden University Libraries on Europeana. We invite you to watch the videos first,  and afterwards enjoy browsing and viewing the manuscripts yourself, for as long as you like, with ample opportunity to zoom in on details of your choice.



Before the invention of the printing press in the 1450s medieval books were written with quill and ink. Medieval script tended to change over time but was also influenced by strong local traditions. This phenomenon helps scholars to date and localise manuscript books.

Explore the manuscript books yourself:



Chapters in modern printed books begin on a new page, and paragraphs after a blank line. In medieval manuscript books, however, pages incorporated a variety of visual cues such as colour and decoration, which helped the reader navigate the text.

Explore the manuscript books yourself:



Although manuscripts could be read from cover to cover, medieval readers also read selectively. Clever navigational tools such as indices and running titles, were introduced for readers to find specific parts of the text. We find these in schoolbooks, but also in devotional works and in other genres.

Explore the manuscript books yourself:



Most medieval scribes did their job without revealing their identity. But several of them, upon reaching the end of the copied text and with a sigh of relief in their heart, signed and dated their work in a colophon. We can piece together further information about scribes by looking at errors made during the writing process and how they were corrected by the scribe or a colleague.

Explore the medieval books yourself:



A medieval manuscript book is like an archaeological object with many layers. These layers can reveal not only traces of the scribe but also traces of the users the book encountered during the many centuries of its existence. These traces can include various annotations, explaining or commenting on the text, but also doodles with or without significant relation to the text.

Explore the manuscript books yourself:



The binding is the ‘outside’ of a book, protecting the words on the inside. There are impressive medieval bindings with blind-tooled leather over wooden boards, but also simple bindings that just consist of a flexible parchment cover. Many medieval manuscripts were rebound, either in the Middle Ages, or later.
Frequently, medieval and post-medieval books contain traces of ‘predecessors’: fragments of manuscripts that were repurposed, when their texts were deemed worthless. For example, parchment leaves could be cut up to strengthen a new binding.

Explore the manuscript books yourself:



The present state of a medieval manuscript can differ considerably from its original state, when it left the scriptorium or workshop. A binding can even contain one or more other manuscripts that were created separately. Such a composite volume may contain texts on related subject matters, but that is not necessarily always the case.

Explore the manuscript books yourself:



The appearance of a book can inform us about the way it was used. For instance, the dimensions of a Gradual are huge because it was used by choir singers during liturgical services in the church, where it was placed on a lectern. A tiny Processional, by contrast, could be held in one hand by a user while walking and singing in a procession.

Embracing jazz as an expression of freedom

When jazz was banned in Nazi Germany, losing one of the interwar European epicenters, it found refuge in France and UK, amplifying the culture of jazz clubs. Figures like Benny Carter and Coleman Hawkins forged their names during this period in the European scene.

In the 1930s, both artists and many other American musicians touring in Europe recorded in France with the famous Django Reinhardt, the Romain-French guitarist born in Belgium and leader of the Quintette duHot Club de France.

With the arrival of the Second World War and to boost the morale of the troops, a golden era for jazz big bands was shaped by jazz legends like Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong and the fabulous Cotton Club musician Cab Calloway. With the allied victory and American soldiers again settled in Europe, a second wave consolidated the introduction of the genre.

The eclosion of a new political and cultural paradigm as a breaking point with the decadence of war promoted a favourable atmosphere for Black musicians to expand their careers across the Atlantic. A young Miles Davis came to Europe for the first time after the Second World War to play in the first International Jazz Festival of France. He became in time Knight of the Legion of Honour, stated in his autobiography:

It changed the way I looked at things forever ... I loved being in Paris and loved the way I was treated. Paris was where I understood that all white people were not the same; that some weren't prejudiced.

In countries like Germany, a growing net of federal radio stations and jazz clubs became multipliers in the dissemination of the genre and lifestyle. The need for youngsters to disassociate from a recent traumatic past, made them embrace jazz as an expression of freedom standing against fascism and the loss of moral compass by their parent's generation.

As the German historian Berndt Ostendorf says, ‘if Hitler had been against jazz, it had to be good’. For some jazz lovers now entering the Cold War, this style connected them with civil rights activism and to some elite, with a subversive and existentialist attitude aligned with the philosophical questioning of the period.

Meanwhile, a new generation of amazingly talented black musicians were developing a new expression of jazz: the bebop. This new jazz form, with faster tempos, complex syncopation and intricate melodies was played by small combos of musicians such as quartets and trios. The music was meant for listening rather than dancing, resulting in smaller clubs. Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Kenny Clarke and Thelonious Monk, among many others became heroes, opening a new chapter in jazz history and the European scene.

But what happened in the meantime with the Black women artist? Find out during Women's History Month in our next blog on Black vocalists in Europe.

Disclaimer. The narrative about the origins of Jazz in Europe oversimplifies the process by describing a very linear description of the events. With these stories we don’t underestimate the constant Black influence in arts and culture in Europe over centuries or the diverse national and unique stories. Jazz didn’t develop in a vacuum in Europe. The Black American jazz waves helped to reconnect with folk and national music traditions where this influence was already present and by rediscovering elements like improvisation, an aspect removed from European music canons.

20th century photographer inspired by classical antiquity

Herbert List was a German photographer who was active in the early part of the 20th century. His photographs were published in leading fashion magazines such asVogueandHarper's Bazaar.

Born in Hamburg in 1903 in a wealthy family, List began to explore photography in the late 1920s, taking photographs during travels while working for his family's coffee company.

In the 1930s, he turned this interest into a career. In 1936, he was forced to leave Germany due to the Nazi persecution as he was gay and one of his grandparents was Jewish. He moved to Paris with his lover George Hoyningen-Huene and decided to dedicate himself fully to photography.

Between 1937 and 1939, he travelled in Greece and Italy with Hoyningen-Huene, taking the photographs seen here. His photographs of temples, sculptures, landscapes and people were published in a bookLicht über Hellas('Light over Greece').

These photographs are in keeping with his aesthetic. After World War II, his photography career continued until the 1960s. Throughout this time, he took black-and-white photographs, often male nudes taken in Italy and Greece, inspired by classical architecture - and today is considered to be a classic modernist photographer.

How the page layout evolved during the early years of the printed book

The first books produced in Europe using the movable type printing system were printed in the 1450’s in Mainz, Germany. Although printing had already been practised for several centuries in China, Japan and Korea, it was German inventor Johann Gutenberg (1400-1468) who perfected the technique that allowed the mass reproduction of texts and the fabrication of high quality printed books.

Rising alphabetisation in Europe (with the expansion of the paper and ink industries) resulted in a larger demand for books. New developments in the metal industry paved the way for the mechanisation of book production through Gutenberg’s movable type system: a process that depended largely on the ability to melt metal into large numbers of minuscule Latin letterforms that could be arranged in endless combinations on a matrix.

In fact, Gutenberg’s innovative system changed two very important aspects of the printing process.  Rather than creating a wooden matrix of the entire page, the typographer would arrange individual metal letterforms into a text with a proper page layout in order for ink to be applied to the protruding lettered surface.

Then, each letter was cast out from metal rather than carved out of wood, making matrices more resistant to wear.  Once the matrix was inked and ready, it would be ‘stamped’ onto parchment or paper using a wooden press. The choice between these two mediums was wholly commercial, depending on the means of the buyer and on the use the book was going to have. This new process allowed Gutenberg to print hundreds of pages a day as opposed to the two or three pages a scribe could copy in the same amount of time.

Among the first books to be printed was the Bible, Saint Jerome’sVulgate(above), more commonly known as the Gutenberg Bible. Gutenberg and his two associates, Johann Fust and Peter Schoeffer, managed to print them on parchment in 1455; the largest and most ambitious editing project of its time.

The text was laid out in two columns, each one consisting of 42 lines. This Bible is called a ‘42-line Bible’. For the letters, Gutenberg chose a gothic type, most notably thetextura quadrata, used in liturgical books. His first Bibles were printed in both parchment and paper (parchment editions being the most expensive and the least common).

The first printed books were hand-finished. They had spaces left empty for painted letters in red and blue (rubrication), titles, musical notations or words in other languages (Greek, for example) as well as for illustrations and decorations (for the more luxurious editions). In fact, printed books were initially made to closely resemble manuscripts. Scholars and clerics were used to reading manuscripts and were not too keen on changing their habits. The way in which text was presented to the reader in the Middle Ages not only satisfied a need for visual structure, but helped create mental constructs.

Every detail contributed to the comprehension and the memorization of the contents of the book. So the first printed books, also known as incunables orincunabula(Latin term meaning ‘cradle’ used to identify printed books produced up until 1500) perfectly imitated the overall aesthetics of the hand-written book. This close imitation was meant to satisfy mediaeval reading and learning habits as they changed.

If we observe the same chapter (Saint Andrew) within three different editions of the Golden Legend (la légende dorée) orLegenda Aureaby Jacobus of Varagine, it becomes clear how the page layout evolved during the early years of the printed book.

Above is the chapter on Saint Andrew from a fourteenth-century manuscript of theLegenda Aurea. The text is very densely laid out, leaving no empty spaces. The first words of each section are written in red, and the first letter of each paragraph is painted with alternations of red and blue.

Compared to a printed paper copy of the same text from 1475 (below) we can see how a similar layout has been kept. The text is still laid out in two columns. The upper-case initials still give structure to the text with alternating colours and have almost identical ornamentation. Generous margins leave plenty of space for annotations and commentary.

Both volumes have a great number of abbreviations. In fact, abbreviations allowed the scribe to save not only time but costs. The upside being that more text could fit in a smaller number of pages, and the downside being that the text was harder to read. The typography of the 1475 edition, however, is more rounded, airy and easier to read.

Late Mediaeval books had three distinct types of scripts, each one popular for a specific genre or category of text. Gothic writing was used for liturgical manuscripts. French ‘batarde’ was used for vernacular texts in French and a new Humanist minuscule was adapted in Italy from the Carolingian minuscule as a clear and elegant vehicle for humanistic texts. The first typographers didn’t hesitate to follow this tradition. Religious books were printed in gothic typography, French books in ‘batarde’ and classical books in humanist minuscule.

This third example (below) of the same chapter of theLegenda Aurea, dating from 1499, reflects how the printed book had begun to emancipate itself from its manuscript predecessor, becoming more similar to the books we are used to today. An engraved image of Saint Andrew’s martyrium opens the chapter. The image plays a major role in the visual perception of the page which has become more dense, structured solely by its printed initials in black. As opposed to the first two examples of this same text, there are fewer abbreviations, making it easier to read. The presence of foliation (numbered pages) make the book easier to look through and the choice of language (vernacular) opens the text up to a greater public.

Although manually-colored initials are still found in books up until the mid-sixteenth century, with time, the use of coloured letters to organise the text gradually diminished in favour of tables of contents and indexes that facilitated navigation through the different chapters of the book. Around the year 1500, the Venetian publisher Aldus Manutius further enhanced reading experience by introducing new punctuation as well as italic print, allowing him to fit more text into a reduced book format.

The invention of the printing press was a driving force in the spread of knowledge and information all over Europe. It revolutionised the way in which people read and, therefore, the way in which they thought. Researchers were able to publish their own treatises more easily than before and have them commented and critiqued by their colleagues. Use of vernacular tongues increased, as did alphabetisation. Canonical texts became ever more precise and their versions standardised.  Ideas travelled far and wide, giving direct access to information to a larger number of people, in many ways emancipating culture from political and religious control; in other ways, control over text content was facilitated because printed material was more easily traceable.

Black American musicians who mainstreamed jazz throughout Europe after World War I and World War II

When we talk about jazz in Europe, Black musicians become royalty. The introduction of jazz in Europe is a kaleidoscope of national and sometimes local stories difficult to encapsulate. But one aspect in which jazz historians agree is on the widespread European fascination and admiration for Black American musicians who mainstreamed this innovative and free style throughout the continent after the First and Second World War.

Everyone locates the origins of jazz in the nineteenth century by Black American communities in New Orleans (Louisiana) and particularly in Congo Square, where enslaved people would meet on Sundays to sing, play music and dance to their homeland songs. They mixed Caribbean music with African beats and southern church melodies, producing in time innovative rhythms like the ragtime, catwalk, foxtrot or Charleston. Key figures in these advancements were Buddy Bolden, Scott Joplin and King Oliver.

But one of the most fascinating chapters in jazz history is devoted to understanding how this new style transformed into such a venerated style and widespread movement in Europe. In the interwar periods, Europe became an important venue and resort for Black musicians, nowadays it's the largest market for jazz music.

Historians describe the introduction of the new Black American sounds, coined later as jazz, in two waves after the First and the Second World War. In the first wave, both Paris and Berlin of the Weimar Republic became capitals of jazz thanks to Black American bands that either arrived near the end of or after the war to play for soldiers and civilians. One very well-known example was the James Reese band.

Many artists remained afterwards to make a living. Sidney Bechet, Duke Ellington and Louis Amstrong, returned regularly all throughout their careers to Europe with every new assemble and production they put in place.

It’s commonly believed that Europeans embraced jazz not only because it was Black American and was considered ‘exotic’, but also because it marked the secession from the older European culture. In parallel, it served the modernism zeitgeist and the avant-garde agenda, with futurism and surrealism aesthetics.

Other important factors played a role. The economic boom of the happy 1920s met an increasing demand for live performances and recorded music. Commercial radio was growing as popular media in many households, helping to break racial barriers. And top-class entertainers, like Josephine Baker, helped to promote jazz music and Black American culture more widely in Europe.

However, Europeans weren’t as colour blind in their attitudes towards Black musicians as some narratives state still today. If Black American musicians could find a more favourable atmosphere and respect in Europe than in their segregated homeland, the imbalance in jazz talent between Black American and European musicians promoted institutional racism. First in France in the 1920s and later after the Second War War in the UK, labour laws limited Black Americans performances in Europe to protect the white European market.

But what happened in the jazz scene in Europe after the Second War is another story. If you want to know what happened next, read Part 2. ‘If Hitler had been against jazz, jazz had to be good’

Disclaimer. The narrative about the origins of Jazz in Europe oversimplifies the process by describing a very linear description of the events. With these stories, we don’t underestimate the constant Black influence in arts and culture in Europe over centuries or the diverse national and unique stories around the reception of this style. Jazz didn’t develop in a vacuum in Europe. The Black American jazz waves helped to reconnect with folk and national music traditions where this influence was already present, as well as rediscover elements like improvisation, an aspect removed for generations from European music canons.

Follow the evolution of lace craft, from myth to machine

Many legends surround the origins of lacemaking. On the Italian island of Burano, not far from Venice, it is believed that the fine spray created by the splashing of a mermaid's tail inspired the elaborate motifs enriching plain white cotton, linen and silk. Another even more romantic story dates back to centuries ago. A woman, betrothed to an Adriatic fisherman, received from her fiancé a fishnet interlaced with a web of glistening seaweed. When the man left for war, the girl studied the weave of the beloved gift and reproduced its pattern: so, lace was created, a true labour of love.

Legends tend to romanticise the technical history related to craft. However, they also allow us to understand the emotional value of these objects. Not only can intricate lacework feel precious to its creators; it is also cherished by those who desire, buy and use these objects in everyday life. In turn, a well-crafted and well-loved piece of lace becomes heritage, a testimony of the past and a legacy for the future.

Venice seems to be indeed the very first place where lace was ‘invented’, or better, crafted, in the early sixteenth century, as theNüw Modelbuch, the first book mentioning lace printed in Zurich in 1561, explains: here it is said that lace arrived in Zurich from Italy in about 1536. The beauty of lace quickly made it a sought-after detail of dress for both men and women, and therefore lace objects were brought around by travellers and merchants, as desirable gifts and lucrative artefacts to be sold to admiring clients.

Not only objects, but workers (and their skills) used to travel too. Experienced lacemakers were called by foreign courts to bring their art to different clientèle. Caterina de Medici asked artist Federico Vinciolo to go to the French court in 1585, where he established a school. Later, the Venetian senate even issued a decree that ordered the return of ‘artists and handicraftsmen’ practising their art in any foreign land.

There are two main types of lace: bobbin lace, made with multiple threads, and needle lace, made of a single thread. Bobbin lace is an evolution of the braids decorating accessories, clothes and furnishings; needlelace is probably a result of openwork (linking pieces of fabric through seaming and decorating edges with loops) and cutwork (decorative stitching worked within small spaces cut out of linen).

In the Seventeenth century, lacemaking was very much associated with women, who would learn the technique from a very young age. Women of all classes would engage in the craft, which was time-consuming and labour intensive.

Finer threads and more complex designs appeared in the Eighteenth century, when lace was extremely sought after, especially from France, where Argentan and Alençon became the centre for needle lace production. The most exquisite bobbin lace though was produced in the Flanders, with Valencienne as capital together with Mechlin and Binche.

With the industrial revolution came big changes in the processes of lacemaking: machines and human hands would for the first time work together to produce lightweight and intricate nets and, after many experimentations and adjustments, proper lace, very similar to the one crafted by hand in the previous centuries.

Whether it was crafted industrially or by hand: lace has stood for centuries as a symbol of love, finery, caring, and stature. Take good care of the lacework that gets handed down to you: it might carry with it a long legacy.

Poetry

Activism

India's renowned poet and freedom fighter

Sarojini Naidu was an acclaimed poet and major figure in India’s struggle for independence. She advocated for civil rights, women’s emancipation and anti-imperialism.

Sarojini was born in a Bengali family on 13 February 1879 in Hyderabad State, India. Her father was principal of Hyderabad college and her mother a poet.  Her parents had eight children, who were encouraged to pursue their creative fields.

At 12 years old, she took a university entrance exam and received the highest rank. Her play 'Maher Muneer' which was written in Persian impressed the ruler of the Kingdom of Hyderabad who allowed her to receive a scholarship to study abroad. She went on to study in England from 1895 to 1898 and travelled briefly around Europe.

When she returned to Hyderabad in 1898, she married physician Govindarajulu Naidu in an inter-caste marriage which was considered groundbreaking at the time due to inter-caste marriages being frowned upon. Despite it being seen as scandalous at the time, both families approved of their marriage.

Sarojini is well known for her poetry that was considered beautiful enough to be sung.

Her first book of poems ‘The Golden Threshold’ was published in 1905 and included a sketch of a young Sarojini by Irish artist John Butler Yeats. ‘The Bird of Time’ was her second and most strongly nationalist book of poems, published in 1912 in both London and New York. It includes ‘In the Bazaars of Hyderabad’ in which she describes the common scenes in the bazaars of Hyderabad, set in the form of conversations between vendors and customers.

The last book of poems published in her lifetime ‘The Broken Wing’ (1917) includes the poem ‘The Gift of India’ which critiques the British empire’s exploitation of Indian mothers. After her death in 1949, her poems and unpublished works were edited by her daughter Padmaja Naidu and collected in ‘The Feather of the Dawn’ published in 1961.

Sarojini became a popular public speaker in 1904, using her platform to promote women’s education, women's rights and India’s independence. She met social reformer and women’s rights activist Muthulakshmi Reddy in 1909 and anti-colonial nationalist Mahatma Gandhi in 1914.

In 1917, Sarojini and Muthulakshmi established the Women’s Indian Association. That same year she went to London to advocate universal suffrage in front of the Joint Select Committee.

Back in India, she joined Gandhi’s movement of non violence resistance against British rule and travelled to London in 1919 as part of the All India Home Rule League in order to further her efforts for India’s freedom.

Sarojini gave lectures in India on social welfare and women’s empowerment and campaigned for more women to be represented in India’s independence movement. 
She became president of the Indian National Congress political party in 1925 - the first woman to lead the party.

In 1930, Sarojini among other women activists including Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay persuaded Gandhi to allow women to join the Salt March, a non violent march protesting the British salt monopoly. It lasted twenty-four days and on April 6 1930, when Gandhi was arrested, he appointed Sarojini as the new leader of the campaign.

Sarojini was arrested several times due to her nationalist activities. After India’s independence from British rule in 1947, she was appointed as governor of the United Provinces in present day Uttar Pradesh. This made her India’s first woman governor. She remained in office until her death in 1949.

Her birthday 13 February, is celebrated in India as National Women’s Day to honour women's voices in India's history. Her work along with those of other Indian women prove that the battle for suffrage was not just fought by western women, a side of the women's suffrage movement which has been often overlooked.

Duel on the Pizzo Groppera

IFA and the future of radio (in 1989)

Sines Relay Station

Belgrade via Cologne

Ö1 Anniversary

To be continued!

Selected broadcast reports from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland

Radio is quite a phenomenon. Invented over 100 years ago, it continues to be an important mass medium (even though TV and the internet have certainly come to dominate). In Germany, some 35 million people – or 30% of the population – listen to radio programsevery single day. Stories revolving around the airwaves themselves are frequently published by other media. A quick dive into the vaults ofEUscreenuncovers an astonishing number of 'radio stories' on European TV channels. Here's a selection of favourites from the German-speaking world.

Titled like a Spaghetti Western, this full-length SRF documentary tells (the first part of) the story of Radio 24, Switzerland's private broadcasting pioneers. Pizzo Groppera is the name of an Italian Mountain in Lombardy. It is almost 3000m high, located close to the Swiss border and the Zurich metropolitan area, and was therefore considered a perfect location when Roger Schawinski and his crew decided to set up their own FM station in 1979 (with a studio in Cernobbio/Como).

Back then, Swiss law did not allow private broadcasting – so the government in Bern immediately labelled Radio 24 a pirate operation and tried its hardest to shut it down. Produced in 1980, Duel only depicts some of the events surrounding Radio 24, which can be summarised like this: lots of debates on both sides of the border, legal sabotage by the Swiss government (no weather and road reports for you!), a "free radio" movement, mass demonstrations in Zurich, widely supported Radio 24 petitions, a number of raids by the Italian (!) police, and – finally – the legalization of Radio 24 (and all private broadcasting in Switzerland), as well as the move of the station and the studio to Zurich. In the age of YouTube channels and Spotify podcasts it's hard to imagine that the launch of a private radio station could create such turmoil, but in the late 70s and early 80s the Radio 24 venture was a pretty big deal.

IFA (= International radio exhibition Berlin) is one of Europe's leading tech shows and usually a good place to learn about current trends in broadcasting and digital media. In the short report featured above, RIAS (closed in late 1993 and subsequently made a part of DW and Deutschlandradio) covers the official 1989 DSR kick-off by Christian Schwarz Schilling (then Germany's minister responsible for telecommunications). It is no surprise if the term DSR does not ring a bell.

First prototyped in 1982, officially adopted in 1984 and launched with pomp and circumstance five years later, DSR was supposed to drastically improve broadcasting quality and usher in the era of digital radio in Germany. In retrospect, the project was a big failure, though. Receivers were expensive, few stations supported the new standard (DSR started out with a bundle of only 16 radio programs), alternative technologies prevailed, and DSR was officially shut down in January 1999. DAB/DAB+ later on became the first successful and sustainable digital radio standard in Germany. However, even in 2022, classic FM stations are still around.

Back in the heyday of shortwave radio, international broadcasters depended on so-called relay stations, i.e.: installments in remote places that would receive broadcasts from the organization's headquarters and then pass them on – relay them – to target areas that could otherwise not be reached.

In a fascinating, very technical 1993 report, a DW journalist pays a visit to his broadcaster's relay station in Sines, Portugal. Opened in 1970, the site had recently been upgraded with two modern antennas. Among other interesting radio facts, the report explains why a place like Sines was picked to reach audiences in Eastern Europe and Russia: Because of the particularities of short wave radio and so-called 'dead zones', you actually needed to go west in order to broadcast east.

The report also features incredibly geeky terms like 'vertically polarized logarithmic-periodic antenna' – which will not be discussed in detail here. The relay station in Portugal was closed in late 2011, but it is fondly remembered by older engineers, and it lives on the collective DW memory: One of the conference rooms in the broadcaster's Bonn headquarters is called 'Sines'.

The B92 story is another 'radio on tv' report by and about DW. But first and foremost, it's a story about freedom of expression and solidarity among journalists and media managers: In December 1996, Serbian radio broadcaster B92 was banned from the airwaves by the Milošević government, which had been extremely unhappy with the fact that the station had continuously covered swelling student protests against nationalist propaganda or election fraud. What followed after the shutdown was international outrage and a wave of solidarity.

Several radio stations – among them DW, then based in Cologne – decided to take B92's programs and broadcast them via their own network. Needless to say, they could not tap into terrestrial frequencies in Belgrade, but the combination of short wave and satellite radio (and early internet broadcasting ) literally sent a strong signal. It only took a couple of days until B92 was officially back. At least one crisis in the Balkans had been averted.

In case you are struggling with the umlaut: It is aclose-mid front rounded vowel. In this context, it stands for Österreich (= Austria), and Ö1 is simply one of the Alp Republic's national radio stations, operated by public broadcaster ORF. The above featured report on Ö1's 40th anniversary (which took place in 2007) is rather unspectacular. However, it features one great quote by the ORF's former Director General, Gerhard Bacher: 'I'll never forget when I first came to this building, in 1967, when everybody was like: "You know, TV is gonna kill radio broadcasting any day now." And I said: You're totally crazy. We'll actually have a great radio renaissance!'

Of course, Bacher was completely right. Even though TV became very successful in the 1960s/70s and the ORF also took to the internet a couple of decades later, its radio stations are still around and an integral part of the brand. In 2022, Ö1 celebrates its 55th anniversary.

Will there be more radio stories on TV (and in other media) in the future? That is very likely. Not just because old school radio is still a thing, but also because audio broadcasting constantly evolves and inspires web formats. Some argue, for example, that Clubhouse or Twitter Spaces is basically special interest talk show radio rebooted on social media. Last, but not least, radio is the basis for a number of groundbreaking technologies – like WiFi, 5G/6G, or space photography. There are lots of reasons why people will want to talk on and about the airwaves for years to come.

Two tutelary figures

Pioneers from Taiwan

The new Chinese generation

Until February 13, 2022 the Asian Arts Museum in Nice is holding an exhibition entitledLandscapes from the Soulpresenting 25 works produced by 11 artists from Taiwan and China. Dating from the 1960s to the present day, these creations operate a fusion between Chinese millennial pictorial tradition and Western abstraction.

At the end of the 1940s, Zao Wou-Ki, Chu Teh-Chun, Chuang Che, Hu Chi-Chung and Fong Chung-Ray discovered Western abstraction in Paris or Taiwan echoingshanshui, or Chinese landscape painting, in which the artist does not formally represent nature, but soaks up the landscape to release its own interpretation and convey the intangible. They drew inspiration to paint in a new way. They also decided to introduce themselves to the Western world by travelling to Europe and the United States.

Influenced by the artistic universe of Paul Klee (1879-1940),Zao Wou-Ki趙無極 (1920-2013), incorporated motifs inspired by archaic ideograms on luminous background in his first abstract works. Towards the end of the 1950s, these signs tended to fade. In his later works, the artist extended his chromatic palette, endeavoring to render light and transparency so as to paint the breath of life and movement.

Chu The-Chun朱德群 (1920-2014) studied Western art in the Chinese Academy of Arts in Hangzhou and taught Western painting in Taiwan from 1949 to 1955. He discovered in France the Parisian abstract painting with the “Nouvelle École de Paris” and the work of Nicolas de Staël (1913-1955) in 1956, which prompted him to reflect on the concept of non-figuration. Nature is omnipresent in his works, a cosmic nature where the elements intertwine, where light springs from the fusion of colors. By its warm tones the oil on canvas Song of joy (2006) evokes the contemplation of nature at sunset, and by its title, the inspiration that the artist constantly drew from classical music.

In Taiwan two avant-garde movements were created in 1956. They renewed the practice of painting by striking a subtle balance between international trends - in which abstraction was becoming a common language - and the expression of Chinese identity.

Hu Chi-Chung 胡奇中 (1928-2012), Fong Chung-Ray 馮鐘睿 (b. 1934) and Chuang Che 莊喆 (b. 1934) were all members of theFifth Moon Group(Wuyue huahui 五月畫會). The first two artists experimented with new techniques, such as incorporating sand into their oils. Hu Chi-Chung, who discovered pictural abstraction through the works of Willem de Kooning (1904-1997), presents colorful and dreamlike landscapes full of vitality and joy.

Fong Chung-Ray gives a rougher aspect to his flat tints with a brush made of rush fibers. Gradually, he turned to Buddhist spirituality and explored the notion of temporality, endeavoring to render the effects of time on matter or resorting to collages and prints.

Chuang Che, enraptured by the grand landscapes of Michigan, offers chaotic scenes on large formats, made of bright colors, turbulent shapes and material effects, from which, however, joy and harmony spring up.

Hsiao Ming-Hsien 蕭明賢 (b. 1936) was the youngest of the founding members of the Ton Fan Group (Dongfang huahui 東方畫會), which favoured a more geometric abstraction. His free, spontaneous style is intimately linked to his love for classical music, conveying rhythm to his paintings.

In China, after more than 30 years of Socialist Realism, a new generation of artists revisited tradition through "experimental ink" and digital media. Their landscapes revived the innovative approach initiated more than half a century before.

Wucius Wong 王無邪 (b. 1936), who studied Western painting in the United States, seeks to regain the greatness of the Song Dynasty painters. He was one of the first to renew the practice of ink in compositions full of chromatic variations, in which geometric shapes and lines disrupt the rules of scale and distance.

Li Chevalier 詩藍 (b. 1961), after learning the techniques of the Quattrocento masters in Italy, drew inspiration from Far East aesthestics and culture. Her techniques include mixing ink with sand, pigments and mineral shavings, or applying collages on canvas. Her landscapes inspired by the desert, where silence, space and breath vibrate, invite the spectator on an inner journey.

Zheng Chongbin 鄭重賓 (b. 1961) experiments with the expressive power of ink on paper by integrating white acrylic into it, to develop new chromatic nuances and shades of grey. Through new media such as videos and installations, he seeks to capture the breath, the cosmos, the visible and the invisible, and evokes the place of man within nature.

The youngest artist featured in the exhibition, Yang Yongliang 楊泳梁 (b. 1980), provides another example of the transposition of classical shanshui works through digital media. His photomontages, videos and installations integrate nature in a resolutely urban context. They re-envision the relationship between man and nature, which was present in traditional painting, while raising the economic, social and environmental problems caused by the rampant urbanisation and industrialisation, not only in China but also around the world.

Rao Fu 傅饒 (b. 1978) borrows multiple references from classical German painting, interweaving past and present eras in landscapes with the Chinese triple perspective. The ghostly, almost transparent figures that inhabit them blend into an environment that becomes, according to the artist, the mirror of his inner world, while it remains free of interpretation.

The crossbreeding which gave rise to the works of the artists presented in this exhibition stems above all from a choice guided by their sensitivity and circumstances. This meeting of cultures and the relationship to their own identity gives birth to the traditions of tomorrow.

Tradition, far from being based simply on a principle of conservation, manifests a singular capacity for variation. Zao Wou-Ki and Chu Teh-Chun led the way, others followed. Their works, considered "modern" today, may one day become the paradigms of the "tradition" of the Chinese landscape.

Globalisation and the undergoing Chinese path toward predominance put the landscape motif in the process of asserting itself as a marker of sinity, and we can expect to find this motif more and more frequently in global art with the emergence of ever-increasing Chinese artists at the forefront of innovation. Paintings, sculptures, photographs, but also performances, immersive installations and new media show a Chinese landscape vector of meaning, reappropriation and discourse on the world.

Traditional sport since prehistoric times

Lucha canaria(Canarian wrestling) is a traditional sport practiced in the Canary Islands (Spain), a part of the folklore, games and traditions of the islands. It has been part of the Canary's culture since prehistoric times. Signs of its existence can be found inpintaderas(a form of stamp used by the pre-Hispanic natives of the Canary Islands) and reliefs.

It is presumed that fighting was practiced on important occasions to resolve conflicts, deal with disputes over territorial boundaries, to court ladies and as entertainment in popular festivals. At first, Canarians carried out the fight in several phases: first, they threw stones, next  fencing with a stick, and finally a grabbing phase. Only this final phase remains in the sport nowadays.

Due to the limited contact between the seven different islands, each Canary Island developed different rules in the practice of fighting.

Today, theLucha Canariais considered to be a contact sport: a confrontation between two rivals who must take down their opponent. The winner is the first to make the other fall and touch the ground with any part of the body other than the soles of their feet. This friendly confrontation is calledagarrada(grabbed) and is carried out on a soft surface that cushions the wrestlers' falls - for example, a circle of sand (calledterrero), grass or tatami.

To knock down their opponents, fighters use different techniques calledmañas(skills). There aremañasfor attacking and defending, classified according to the part of the body that is used: arms, legs or trunk.

Wrestlers must be properly dressed withbrega clothing(struggle clothing) which consists of a shirt or blouse and trousers calledbrega pants. These clothes must be made of a strong material, which facilitates gripping and the execution of the techniques and prevents it from tearing.

Before starting the fight, the two opponents must adopt thebregaposition. This consists of crouching at a 90-degree angle with the legs semi-bent, bringing the shoulders together with those of the opponent, with the heads in the side, and stretching the right hand until it touches the sand with the left grabbing the opponent. The pants must be correctly rolled up or raised, waiting for the referee or judges to signal the start of the contest.

Lucha Canaria is generally a team sport, in which two teams made up of between 12 and 18 fighters face each other. The winner is the team that knocks down all the opposing fighters. The strongest fighters of each team are calledpuntales(struts) ordestacados(prominents) (depending on the category they are competing) and they can only go out to fight when there is a considerable difference established in the score. Iindividual and weight competitions are also played at the end of the regular seasons.

Leagues, tournaments and championships are held at an island level, with each island having its own championship. On a regional level, clashes between the best teams from the different islands are also held.

Due to their strength, ability and bravery, many fighters have appeared in the headlines and histories of this beautiful sport. Among them, Francisco Marrero (nicknamed 'Pancho Camurria') stands out for being a very technical fighter. Nowadays, he is remembered with a youth tournament that bears his name.

Pedro Rodríguez del Castillo, better known as 'Pollo de Canteras' was another important fighter. He was a famous athlete from Tenerife, protagonist of great and repeated triumphs, in whose honor a terrero was awarded with his name.

When Western traders and colonists set sail for China in the 17th Century, they found an empire focused solely on protectionism.

When Western traders and colonists set sail for China in the 17th Century, they found an empire focused solely on protectionism. China had severed most ties with the West, not allowing any foreigners into its borders. Exceptionally, the Jesuits were allowed to stay at court because of their knowledge of mathematics and astronomy. Merchants, on the other hand, could only stay in the port of Guangzhou.

Both groups painted a different picture of China and Chinese institutions. The Jesuits were living at the sophisticated Chinese imperial court, while the traders  complained about corruption and obstruction by Chinese merchants inGuangzhou.

The arrival of merchants was also the beginning of official exchanges and meetings between embassies and the Chinese imperial court in order to establish trading relations.

One of the first was a Dutch delegation sent in 1655 by the Dutch East Company based in Batavia (today’s Jakarta). But the Chinese assumed the Dutch were just coming to pay allegiance to the emperor. The same happened to the Portuguese and Russian delegations coming through Siberia.

One of the most famous delegations was sent by the United Kingdom in 1792. We know that again there was a problem with protocol:Lord Macartney, the British ambassador, refused to perform theKowtow(the nine times prosternations) to pay respect to the Chinese emperor.

This problem summed up the distance and misunderstandings between China and the West. In China, foreigners were regarded as inferior. On the other hand, the West was aiming at establishing equal partnerships. As a result of the breach in communication and understanding, several other European diplomatic missions suffered the same treatment, increasing the anger and igniting a desire for revenge.

After the twoOpium_Wars(1839-1842 and 1856-1860), China was forced to open its harbours to foreigners and lease some of their territories. These lands were called ‘Concessions’, officially occupied and governed by foreign powers - such as Hong Kong, that came under British rule. The humiliation of China was seen by the West as an act of vengeance for their disrespect in the previous century.

A substantial influx of Western people ensued, now including soldiers, scientists, journalists and artists. Many migrants left behind their native country to find adventure and fortune on the other side of the globe. The opening of theSuez Canalin 1869 made the journey faster than ever.

The cross-continental flow of people instigated the construction of new infrastructures, such as ports, hostels, roads, railways and telegraphs. These, in turn, made the discovery of China easier for a new category of visitors: tourists. Moreover, while before merchants couldn’t bring their family, now women were allowed to enter the country too.

Among the tourists, adventurers, merchants and other professionals visiting China for a short stay or an extended period, many would share  their experiences in letters and drawings, official reports or research papers. A new type of media appeared as well: photography.

The earliest pictures of Hong Kong were taken byPierre Rossierand followed by many others. Thanks to small and easy-to-use cameras like those produced by theEastman Kodak Company, amateurs as well as professionals created a new image of China. Western photographers also taught Chinese people how to use photographic equipment.

European families who relocated in China sent gifts, pictures and letters to their relatives back home, talking about their lives. Often, we learn a lot about the lives of the Chinese too, by reading the expats’ views on the people in their service - including drivers, nannies and cooks.

After the creation of thePeople’s Republic of China (PRC), European intellectuals with leftist sympathies continued to visit the country and write articles for newspapers, take pictures or paint the local scenery. Several celebrities, too, visited China in the 20th century, among which the French philosopherJean-Paul Sartreand his companion, authorSimone de Beauvoir(1956).

The Swiss artistGéa Augsbourgvisited China at the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the PRC (1959) and presented his impressions in a series of drawings.

Cultural exchange between the West and China continues to this day: this process of acculturation is how we learn about one another and learn to appreciate each others similarities and differences.

Italian long distance runner who turned failure into success

The appeal of the Olympic Games comes from epic stories and great triumphs, but sometimes also from defeats. From this point of view, the story of Dorando Pietri, and his dramatic experience at the London Olympic Games in 1908, shows how a loss can turn into a victory.

Pietri was an Italian marathon runner who entered the fourth edition of the modern Olympic Games with strong medal ambitions. In previous years, he had achieved important results and was considered to be the strongest Italian runner of the time.

In 1904, the year of his sporting debut, he had won the Italian running championship. In 1905 instead, he had triumphed in a 30 kilometre race in Paris. By the end of his military service, in 1907, he won the Italian 5,000 and 20,000 metres titles.

In all this time, he had only once retired from a race, during the intermediateOlympic Gamesin Athens in 1906. Intestinal problems led to him not finishing the race, even though he was firmly in the lead.

Mindful of this experience, on the occasion of the 1908 London marathon, he decided to start at a slower pace.

However, in the middle of the race he started to move up. He completed this comeback three kilometres from the finish line and was leading the race. But this effort this took had considerably weakened him. When he entered the stadium at White City, he had a large lead on the second runner - but he was exhausted.

The last 200 metres of the race were an ordeal. Firstly, he ran along the wrong path; then, he fell down - only with the support of the umpires was he able to continue. Before reaching the finishing line, he fell down again four more times. He finished the race literally sustained by an umpire and a doctor.

An American athlete, Johnny Hayes, was in second place. Considering this, the US Olympic federation lodged a complaint and the result was that Dorando Pietri was disqualified.

However, the spectators watching the race were thrilled with the Italian's performance. Even the newspapers gave wide coverage to the news, thus transforming the defeat into a victory. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who followed the event on behalf of the Daily Mail, described what happened as follows:

I am sure that no petty personal recompense can in the least console Dorando for the national loss which follows from his disqualification. Yet I am certain that many who saw his splendid effort in the Stadium, an effort which ran him within an inch of his life, would like to feel that he carries away some souvenir from his admirers in England.

Moreover, Queen Alexandra personally gave Pietri a cup as a sign of respect for the deeds accomplished during the race.

The sudden celebrity brought Dorando to theUnited States, where he had the opportunity to again challenge 'Olympic Gold medallist' Johnny Hayes several times. And in most cases, the Italian runner was the winner.

Upon returning toItaly, Dorando continued his sporting activity, still achieving excellent results.

However, sport was no longer his main interest. He had become a sort of mythical athlete and public figure in Italy. He published a book and, thanks to the fame derived from the London games (and the consequent earnings), opened an hotel in Carpi, his hometown, and later a garage in the city of Sanremo.

But there is also a dark side to this wonderful sport story. Dorando Pietri, in fact, was later a staunch supporter of fascism, actively participating in squad actions in his city. When he died in 1942, he was buried, as he explicitly wished, wearing a black shirt, one of the most known symbols of fascism and was celebrated as an hero by Mussolini's regime.

Who was Suzy Solidor?

What was Suzy Solidor's Paris nightclub?

Which artists painted Suzy Solidor?

What happened to Suzy Solidor later in life?

Lesbian entrepreneur, actress, singer and 'the most painted woman in the world'

Suzy Solidor was an icon of Paris in the 1920s and 1930s, a lesbian who owned her own nightclub and became 'the most painted woman in the world'. More than 200 artists painted Suzy, including Tamara de Lempicka, Francis Bacon, Man Ray and more.

Suzy Solidor was born in Brittany in 1900 as Suzanne Marion, the daughter of a single mother. Her name changed to Suzanne Rocher when her mother married in 1907.

The family settled in the Solidor district of Saint-Servan, giving Suzy her later stage name.

She learned to drive in 1916, most likely making her the first woman in Brittany to have a driving licence. DuringWorld War I, she worked as a mechanic and driver in the ambulance corps.

After the war, she moved to Paris where she became involved with Yvonne de Bremond d'Ars, a wealthy antiques dealer. Yvonne owned a home in the seaside resort Deauville, where these photographs were taken.

In 1932, Suzy Solidor opened her first nightclub 'La Vie Parisienne'.

Here, luminaries from arts, aristocracy, entertainment, politics and finance mixed. The club was well-known for its liberal atmosphere, and was popular with queer and heterosexual communities. Solidor was famous as an entertainer and host. She liked to sing saucy sea shanties, and was often depicted in a nautical setting.

While Solidor had male lovers, she was open about her preference for women - she recorded a whole album calledParis-Lesbien.

Solidor was famous for publicity stunts to promote herself and her nightclub.

One of these was to become 'the most painted woman in the world'. She posed for artworks by some of the most famous artists of the time - Georges Braque, Pablo Picasso, Man Ray, Kees van Dongen and many more.

These paintings lined the walls of La Vie Parisienne. It was said that she kept the most flattering and her most liked paintings near her on the wall, while those she liked least were found near the toilets.

Solidor's most famous portrait was painted by Tamara de Lempicka, whom she had a relationship with. When Solidor asked de Lempicka to paint her, she agreed - but only if it would be a nude portrait. The painting was finished in 1933.

DuringWorld War II, La Vie Parisienne was very popular with occupying Nazi German soldiers. Solidor accommodated them, even changing songs to please this audience. After the war, Solidor was tried and convicted as a Nazi collaborator.

She left for the United States for a short time, returning toPariswhere she opened Chez Suzy Solidor in 1954. In 1960, she retired to the south of France, opening Chez Suzy, another cabaret decorated with her many portraits.

In 1973, she gave part of her portrait collection to the city of Cagnes-sur-Mer - a selection of around 40 works can still be seen in theGrimaldi Castle Museum. Suzy Solidor died in March 1983.

At medieval universities, Faculties of Arts were a so-calledpropaedeutic faculty. This meant that you first had to complete your studies at the Faculty of Arts before you were allowed to study at any of the other faculties.

Unlike the other faculties - Law, Theology, and Medicine - the arts had no practical professional use at the time. One could not become an ‘artist’ as one could become a theologian, jurist or doctor.

Rather, the curriculum focused on teaching skills that were similar to present-day basic research skills. Every university required a faculty of arts to exist. In this sense, the faculty of arts was the heart of the university and, although the objective of medieval education was theological knowledge, a general arts education was also desirable.

Arts faculties were organised around the sevenartes liberales(liberal arts). These in turn were organized into two groups.

One group, theTrivium, focused on the study of language, offering courses in grammar, rhetoric and dialectic. The second group, theQuadrivium, focused on the study of numbers: arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and music. TheTriviumformed the basis for correct communication, both orally and verbally. In the end, all seven arts were tools for acquiring knowledge and wisdom, a principle formalised asPhilosophy.

Of theTrivium, dialectic, also known as logic, became the most important.

The dialectic method was taught as an ideal way to reach knowledge, by positioning statements and using logical arguments to either support or contradict the statements. Over time, the dialectic method was introduced as the main method for studying and teaching. Medieval didactic methods at all levels were based firstly on the heard and spoken word. Masters (magister) held oral lectures on fundamental texts, such as the writings of Aristotle on physics, metaphysics, ethics, economics and politics.

Even though the writings of Aristotle were one of the most important sources of study in medieval universities, other writers were of course also discussed.

The works of Priscian and Quintillian, and other great classical grammarians, were also commented upon, and supplemented with useful and practical manuals with samples or exercises. Important texts, for instance, were theArs Dictandi(on how to produce all sorts of juridical documents) and theArs Epistolandi(on how to write letters).

Not only Aristotle’s ideas were influential, but his system of logic as well.

Masters would debate with students (or let the students debate among themselves) on the interpretation of these texts. These debates were structured according to the Aristotelian system of logic: participants relied on statements from authorities, such as the Bible, the Church Fathers, Aristotle and others, to support their positions in the debates. Lectures and debates were held in Latin.

Although lectures were delivered orally, many found their way into writing. 
Students could rework their course notes into a full text, or the master himself could write them down.

Such texts were called commentaries and often identified themselves as Lectura (lecture), Questiones (questions), or Expositio (explanation), followed by the name of the work they were written about. The manuscript below, for example, is known as Petrus of Przemyslavia’s Lectura super Aristotelis Metaphysicam (Lecture on Aristotle’s Metaphysics).

These texts did not pose as if they relied objective, canonical knowledge. Many of these commentaries were shaped as questions and discussions, allowing for divergent opinions. As medieval life and reality was markedly different from the times of Aristotle, they were not mere explications of Aristotle’s ideas, but they were Aristotelian elaborations on modern (and Christian) issues. This often resulted in texts that looked like commentaries but were more or less independent treatises.

After the peak of Scholasticism, between the first half of the 13th century and the beginning of the 14th century, some of these commentaries developed into completely separate treatises. Many commentaries arrived at entirely new ideas and, consequently, often provoked fierce debate. For instance, while the fourteenth-century French scholar Nicholas d’Oresme translated Aristotle’sPoliticainto Middle French, in his annotations he advocates for monarchy as the ideal form of government. This goes against original Aristotelian thought, in which democracy was valued higher.

As the dialectic method was employed in nearly all forms of teaching, life at the faculty of arts largely consisted of discussions on Aristotelian themes. The Philosopher (as Aristotle is usually named in scholastic texts) was held in such high esteem that over time the seven liberal arts were accompanied by three additional fields all taken from his works: natural philosophy, metaphysics and ethics. Natural philosophy touched upon nearly all fields of human knowledge, in what we now would call biology, cosmology or psychology.

These days you are of course no longer obliged to study at the Faculty of Arts before you are allowed to study anything else. But almost all universities have developed around the Faculty of Arts, and a lot of them still have the Arts at their core.

This blog is part of theArt of Reading in the Middle Agesproject which explores how medieval reading culture evolved and became a fundamental aspect of European culture.

How Sanremo changed the way of doing music, television and entertainment

In Italy, the first days of February are the days of “Sanremo”, the Italian Song Festival that “no matter how it goes, it will be a success”. This is a slogan of one of the past editions, which together with the other one “because Sanremo is always Sanremo” summarise its spirit very well.

When the idea of dedicating an event to the Italian song came up, television in Italy did not yet exist: the first edition in 1951 was in fact broadcasted only on radio, and over the years, it marked a success that exceeded the most optimistic expectations of the organisers themselves. You can easily understand why: the Second World War had been over for six years and there was the desire to start having fun and distracting oneself again after a long period marked by grief and destruction.

From the 1960s, but even more from the 1970s on, the Song Festival will become above all a television event. Suffice it to say that it has gone from a single evening to the current five. Basically, from Tuesday to Saturday, the schedule of the first channel of RAI, the Italian public television, is monopolised by the Festival from 8.45 pm until well after midnight, with record ratings, at the level of those usually made by the Italian national football team. And not just for those hours, because many programs aired in those days revolve around the Festival, involving the singers and fueling the controversies. And when it all ends, work begins on the following year's edition.

This festival is undoubtedly the most important Italian singing event that opens, for the winner, the doors of the Eurovision song contest, which, since 1956, represents perhaps the most followed musical event in Europe, and that last year was won by the Italian group Måneskin with the song “Zitti e buoni”, surprisingly triumphant at the Sanremo event.

Thinking back to the last two editions of the festival, someone cannot help but feel a sense of estrangement: in the first week of February 2020, while the world, still partially unaware, was plunging towards the most serious pandemic crisis of recent decades, in Italy, the main topic for a few days was the controversy between two singers who performed at the Sanremo festival. While, in 2021, still in full Covid emergency, the festival takes place anyway but without an audience in the hall.

This year, the singing event celebrates its 72nd edition. As we mentioned above, the first official edition took place in 1951. In the 1952 edition, Nilla Pizzi literally triumphs, singing all three songs classified in the first places.

In the 1950s again, the result of the 1955 competition was singular: with “Buongiorno tristezza” Tullio Pane and Claudio Villa won: the latter, however, only through his recorded voice, being sick at home.

In 1958, Domenico Modugno and Johnny Dorelli triumph with a song that will become very famous all over the world: “Nel blu dipinto di blu”.

The 1960s opened with the victory of Renato Rascel and Tony Dallara, who sang “Romantica”. In 1964, Gigliola Cinquetti triumphs with “Non ho l’età”, who will also win Eurovision, a feat that after her and before the aforementioned Måneskin, will only be achieved by Toto Cotugno in 1990.

During the 1967 edition which took place between 26 and 28 January, a tragic event marked the history of the festival: The suicide in his hotel room of singer Luigi Tenco, who presented the piece “Ciao amore ciao” together with Dalida, an Italian-French singer.

Tenco, who according to one of his many biographers “was an idealist, but also a fragile and vulnerable man [...]. Cultured, possessing a considerable property of language, with such a charm as to catalyze attention every time and yet, strangely, with complexes" wrote in his farewell letter: "I do this not because I'm tired of life (on the contrary), but as an act of protest against an audience that sends ‘Io tu e le rose’ to the final and a commission that selects ‘La Rivoluzione’. I hope it will help clarify someone's ideas ".

Over the years, we still talk about this episode. Many do not want to believe in suicide and a shadow of mystery will continue to hover over what happened in that Sanremo night. Certainly, Tenco was a character ahead of his time and with him, Italy lost one of the most interesting singers of what was called the Genoese school.

1968 is the year of Louis Armstrong at the Festival, of Sergio Endrigo and Roberto Carlo’s victory with “Canzone per te” and of the first of many performances by TV host Pippo Baudo. The decade ends with Bobby Solo and Iva Zanicchi’s victory singing “Zingara”.

But 1969 is also the year that comes after the protests that have filled the squares all over the world. Protests spread out at the Cannes and Venice film festivals and inevitably also arrive in Sanremo, where a counter-festival presented by Dario Fo is organized, where artists that would never have set foot in Sanremo perform, and where, as the newsreel speaker points out, admission is free.

In 1970, Adriano Celentano and Claudia Mori win the festival with the song “Chi non lavora non fa l’amore” (“Who does not work, does not make love”).

In the 1980s, the Sanremo Festival seemed to lose its appeal, especially among the younger generations. It was decided to open the door to singer-songwriters: in 1983 Vasco Rossi made his appearance, with his “Vita spericolata” (“Reckless life”), but the jury will continue to award more traditional songs.

In the 1990s, even from this point of view, the banks broke with the victories of singer-songwriters like Luca Barbarossa, Enrico Ruggeri, La Piccola Orchestra Avion Travel, Roberto Vecchioni to finally arrive at the very young Måneskin after passing, in 2019, from Mahmood, the first Italian singer of second generation to win the Festival.

Fresh air, of course, but that will never completely erase the controversies that the Festival feeds on and will continue to feed in the Italian audience, also because, to conclude with another old slogan, everything makes a show.

We follow the tracks of great China explorers and revisit their accounts of life behind the Great Wall.

Nowadays a flight from Europe to China takes about 12 hours. But not that long ago travellers would have been on the road for weeks, months even. Heading for China used to be a risky undertaking, whether travelling over land or over sea. Still, quite a few daring women and men set out from Europe to the Middle Kingdom and reported back on what they experienced. In this blog, we follow the tracks of great China explorers and revisit their accounts of life behind the Great Wall.

Since Antiquity, the existence of lands beyond the Indus river and India was known in the West. Through the silk roads, goods and men travelled between the continents. Romans loved luxuries from the East - in particular silk - and certainly knew of China: a country they called “Serica” (the land of silk).

China, in turn, also knew of the existence of the Roman empire. They called it “Da-Qin” (Great China). Roman glass objects, such as vases, were found in Chinese tombs: proof of their contact with the West.

A Chinese chronicle, theBook of the Later Han, reports that in 166 AD an ambassador from Rome arrived at the court of emperorHan Huandi(132-168). He was sent by a Roman emperor the Chinese archivists called An-Dun (安墩): possiblyMarcus Aureliusor his predecessorAntonius. Conversely, several Chinese travellers tried to reach the West. They visited the Greco-Bactrian kingdoms (in what is now known as Central Asia), but it seems they never went as far as the Middle East.

Artefacts found in Chinese cities serve as proof of continued connections between West and East in the Middle Ages, including coins from the Byzantine Empire. The capital of China at this time,Xi’An, was the point of arrival of the Silk Road and was therefore inhabited by many foreigners.

European merchants made extensive use of the Silk Road. The most famous among them must be the VenetianMarco Polo(1254-1324), who wroteThe Travels of Marco Polo, also known as Il Milione.

In this famous book, Marco Polo shares stories about his 17 years at the court ofKublai Khan(1215-1260), the grandson ofGenghis Khanand ruler of China.

Religious men, too, used the Silk Road to travel to China, either to serve as an ambassador for the pope or to spread their religion.Nestorianmissionaries are known to have been active in China as early as the 7th century.

In the 13th century, the Italian archbishopGiovanni da Pian del Carpineand the Flemish Franciscan friarWilliam of Rubruckwere sent to the Mongol court. The description of their travels didn’t have the impact of Marco Polo’s book, though, possibly because both had contact with the Mongols only and never went to China.

Several other Italian missionaries did, among whichGiovanni de Marignolli, who was sent to China in 1342, andOdoric of Pordenone. His account is the most important testimony about China after Marco Polo’s.

With the arrival of ships from Portugal, the Netherlands, Spain, France and England on the coast of China in the 16th century, a new era of exchange began. Travelers, however, would find a China much different from the one Marco Polo experienced.

The country was no longer ruled by the Mongols, but under the Chinese dynasty of theMing(1368-1644). The Ming decided to lock China for foreigners, allowing only merchants and Jesuit missionaries to enter.

In 1644 the Ming empire collapsed and was replaced by theQing(1644-1912) : a foreign dynasty that would more or less provide China its current size and borders. Yet the country remained forbidden territory for visitors from abroad. Exceptionally, the Jesuits were allowed to stay at court because of their knowledge of mathematics and astronomy. Merchants, on the other hand, could only stay in the port ofGuangzhou.

Contemporary silver masterpieces from the 'Battle of the Blues'

The Oxford and Cambridge University Boat Race is one of the world’s oldest annual sporting events. The race on the River Thames between two teams representing Oxford and Cambridge Universities is now regularly watched by 250,000 riverside supporters and 10 million TV viewers worldwide.

The first men's race was held in 1829 and has taken place annually since 1856, except during World War I and II and during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The first women's event was held in 1927, with an annual race since 1964. Members of the crews are traditionally known as 'blues', with Cambridge in light blue and Oxford in dark blue.

For the first time in the history of the race, five silver trophies associated with this 'Battle of the Blues' have gone on public display in an exhibition atThe Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge.

The trophies have traditionally resided in the offices of the race sponsors, only being seen by a privileged few on Boat Race Day. In 2020, responsibility for the trophies' safe storage between Boat Races passed to the winning University. With Cambridge winning both the Men's and Women's races in 2021, the trophies were to be stored in there, giving the Fitzwilliam Museum a unique opportunity to display these masterpieces of contemporary British silver side by side.

The display includes the current Men's Blue Boat Race Trophy ('The Aberdeen Asset Management 'Quaich'') and current Women's Blue Boat Race Trophy ('The Newton Trophy'). Both current Blue Boat Trophies are important works by well-known contemporary British silversmiths, representing two alternative ways of creating an artwork in silver.

The Men's Trophy was designed in 2000 by Rachel Hopkins and made by a number of different silversmiths in the workshop of Nicholas Winton working together as a team.

Both trophies have ingenious hidden features. The Men's Trophy, for example, has The Championship Course (the Boat Race route along the Thames from Mortlake to Putney) beautifully engraved inside the bowl of the shallow cup, but this is only visible when the lid is removed.

The Women’s Trophy was designed and made in 2014 entirely by a single silversmith, Rod Kelly.

It includes a list of the earliest Boat Race winners from 1927 to 2013 engraved on a silver plaque underneath the base of the trophy. The winning crews from 2014, when this trophy was first awarded, are recorded on the rim around the top of the cup, with lots of room left for the names of future winners.

The display also includes the current Men's and Women's Reserve Boat Race Trophies ('The Goldie-Isis Cup' and 'The Blondie-Osiris Cup') which were first presented respectively in 1977 and 1992. The original Women's Blue Boat Race Trophy ('The Francombe Cup') first presented in 1936 completes the display.

The display focuses in particular on the commissioning and making of the trophies, showcasing great design and making skills. The research involved has been also detailed in an online exhibition from the Fitzwilliam Museum.

The Blue Boat Trophies are on display at The Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge until 28 March 2022, after which they will move to the winner of the next Boat Race being held on Sunday 3 April 2022.

Belonging and identity in contemporary multicultural Germany

This guest blog by Jan Topolski discusses the films of director Fatih Akin and contains plot spoilers for these.

'My sense of home has expanded. As tectonic plates come closer together, so too have Turkey and Germany grown together for me'(source)

Getürktis the title of one of Fatih Akin's (born 1974) early short films which has a profound significance. 'Getürkt' is a German neologism, which can be translated as the process of making something more Turkish or making it Turkish again.

The word can be applied to the director himself, who is often seen as a typical example of an immigrant artist who combines the traditions of both countries. This is not, however, entirely true and Akin himself hates being called 'Turkish-German' – instead, he would rather be dubbed 'Germany’s Martin Scorsese'. The director says that he identifies with the city of Hamburg more than with the whole country.

His parents came to Germany in the 1960s together with many other 'guest workers' – Akin made a documentary about this entitledThinking about Germany: We Forgot to Go Back(2003). The fate of the previous generation is also reflected in the feature filmSolino(2002), which – unlike Akin’s other films – is not based on his screenplay. The protagonist, Romano Amato, opens an Italian restaurant in the Ruhr region and faces obstacles and misunderstandings caused by cultural differences. Similar elements can be traced in the comedy-dramaSoul Kitchen, where two Greek brothers, Zinos and Illias, run a post-industrial bistro in Hamburg's docklands.

Surprisingly enough, these films revolve around not only the German-Turkish relationship, but also the stereotypes connected with the differences between the North and the South of Germany.

In one of the funniest scenes of the latter film, a rigorous female tax inspector comes to collect the owner’s debts – luckily, the main character finds some money. There happens to be a farewell party going on at Soul Kitchen during which the chef serves desserts with an aphrodisiac to put everyone in a 'good mood'. An orgy ensues and the German tax inspector joins in – at this point, all national distinctions and official roles seem to disappear.

The films mentioned above feature comedic elements, but they deal with serious misjudgement and stigmatisation, which is even clearer in Akin’s better known titles that brought him international recognition and awards, such asHead-on(2004, Golden Bear in Berlin),The Edge of Heaven(2007, Best Screenplay in Cannes) andIn the Fade(2017, Golden Globe). The director uses Turkish-German stereotypes only to show how shallow they are and how they fail to describe the reality that is so dynamically changing. As he stated in an interview some years ago:

'There’s too little identification (in Turkish immigrants) with Germany itself – although this is also changing. It's not constructive for an individual to see yourself not part of the country you were born and grew up in, and instead believe your country is somewhere else. This is creating illusions. And illusions are not something you can really hold on to. I think a lot of this is due to the fact that a lot of Turks still don't feel as if they are welcome in Germany. They feel like second class citizens (…) Even a lot of second and third generation Turks feel this way. It's getting better though. They are identifying themselves more and more with Germany. But still it's too little. Many are still bound to this immovable idea of Turkey and Turkishness, without realising that Turkey itself is moving.' (source)

Head-oncan serve as a perfect illustration for these changes.

A girl named Sibel and much older Cahit get to know each other at a hospital after they both attempt suicide. She is struggling to become independent and convinces him to marry her, because arranged marriage is the only way for her to get away from her conservative family. At first, they live separately, have sex with other people and party like crazy, with time – however – a relationship starts to develop between them. Sibel and Cahit seem to be outsiders, both to the German society (he earns money by collecting empty bottles from bars) and to the Turkish community (she ends up being disinherited by her parents). The last part of Head-on takes part in Istanbul, where the girl goes to meet her fate with her husband following her – coming back to the roots is typical in Akin's films, who often adopts the road movie convention.

The theme of being on the road comes back inCrossing the bridge: The Sound of Istanbul(2005), a documentary about the city’s music scene narrated by Einstürzende Neubaten’s Alexander Hacke – a German among Turks. That's also the case withIn July(2000), where a journey to the East is a chance for a young couple to find each other and forget about Western conventions.

In fact, the film was a breath of fresh air in the director's career, which is associated with much darker films like his acclaimed debutShort Sharp Shock(1998), often compared with Scorsese's Taxi Driver. The film tells the story of three immigrants – a Greek, a Serb and a Turk – living in Akin's beloved Altona district of Hamburg. According to stereotypes that used to be prevalent in Germany, the characters should be members of a gang. The plot also includes a common theme of a thief released from prison who wants to leave his past behind and go back to Turkey with a clean slate.

The Edge of Heavenhas a much more complicated screenplay with six main characters whose stories are masterfully interspersed.

The plot revolves around three relationships between parents and children. Nejat, born in Hamburg, is the son of 'Gasterbeiter' Ali, who in his late years fell in love with a prostitute, Yeter. Her daughter, Ayten, has to flee Turkey because she is a radical activist. She goes to Germany where she meets Lotte – an adventurous student whose mother, Susanne, used to be open-minded, but later adopted a petit-bourgeois mentality. The lesbian relationship between a Turkish political refugee and a privileged German teenager serves as a narrative vehicle which reflects the issues of prejudice and social status. Akin, however, pushes these clichés to the limit andThe Edge of Heavenbecomes another road movie when almost all of the characters set out on a journey to Istanbul – that's where they need to confront the grief after the loss of their relatives or friends and try to overcome personal limitations.

Culture and music play a significant role in this switch between the East and the West – between Turkey and Germany. One film scholar draws particular attention to the following scene:

'Focusing onThe Edge of Heavenwe can take Nejat as a perfect example of living between the German and the Turkish culture, as represented several times throughout the movie. For instance, Nejat's choice to buy a German bookshop in Turkey is a clear result of his dual identity that cannot be separated. In fact, the owner of the bookshop does not hesitate to express his surprise, stating: 'A Turkish professor of German from Germany ends up in a German bookshop in Turkey' Moreover, the song playing in the bookshop strengthens the meaning of this scene. In fact, as Silvery notes 'the music of Bach is heard in a banjo arrangement that styles the composer as a German contributor to the world'. Therefore, Akin's soundtrack choice creates a fusion between the German composer and the traditional Turkish music, underlining the hybridity not only of the character but also of the film’s own director.'

However, there are many more instances of this beyond the example mentioned above.

In another scene, Nejat stops at a petrol station and doesn't recognise the popular singer Kazım Koyuncu played on the radio. The owner of the station is surprised and immediately realises that his customer left the country a long time ago (we get this impression as well). The ending ofThe Edge of Heavensuggests that you can't forget your roots – there's no other choice than to acknowledge them or work through the issues they cause.

Difficult pasts are also the subject of Akin's two last films:The Cut(2014) dedicated to the Armenian Genocide andIn the Fade(2017) about a new wave of terrorism. In the latter, a German woman named Katya loses her child and Kurdish husband – interpreter and lawyer named Nuri – in a bomb attack in Berlin. The police initially suspect that the attack is connected with his previous activity as a drug dealer or political dissident and ignore the widow’s protests. Of course, Nuri had been sentenced for jail once before and was part of a double minority – Kurds have been persecuted in Turkey for decades.

However, the real perpetrators of the bomb attack were in fact two German nationalists, who considered Nuri to be the perfect target because he provided legal and interpreting assistance to other immigrants. Akin's film is not a thriller and does not focus on crime and mystery, but rather on the long and difficult trial that Katja goes through – her traumatic experiences and the desire for revenge. Once again, two elements conflict: the law of a democratic state and the more primal need to inflict punishment – a life for a life. Would Katja be desperate enough to bring her family’s murderers to justice? And at what price?

In his films, Fatih Akin confronts us with questions vital in the contemporary multicultural society, which changes constantly and welcomes new members. He proposes a new sense of belonging and identity – local rather than national – which is evident in the tender images of Hamburg docks or Istanbul çayhanes (tea houses) presented in his works.

InSoul Kitchen, there is a recurring figure of a grumpy fisherman, who rents the same hangar as Zinos – in the beginning, we see him drinking for free and complaining loudly, but later he stands up to fight arm-in-arm with the owner. Another recurring scene inThe Edge of Heavenis when Nejat, Ayten or Susanne stop to greet old backgammon players. That is the relationship between the place and the people that we should nurture – Akin seems to suggest – no matter who the people are or where they're from.

Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg

Kaunas, Lithuania

Novi Sad, Serbia

Esch-sur-Alzette, Kaunas and Novi Sad in the spotlight

In 2022, three cities in Europe - Esch-sur-Alzette (Luxembourg), Kaunas (Lithuania) and Novi Sad (Serbia) - will hold the title of European Capital of Culture.

The European Capital of Culture is an initiative putting culture at the heart of European cities, with EU support for a yearlong celebration of art and culture. It aims to celebrate the cultural features Europeans share and highlight the richness and diversity of cultures in Europe.

Many cities across Europe have held the title since its inauguration in 1985 - let's explore what this year's trio have to offer.

Esch is a town in south-western Luxembourg, situated on the border with France. The town is in the valley of the Alzette river, which flows through the town.

Esch developed from a small village during the middle of the 19th century, with its growth fuelled by mining and steel industries. Its population grew from just hundreds of people in the 1820s to more than 10,000 by the 1900s. Many of the industrial features became disused during the late 20th century, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s and have now been converted to other uses.

The town's football team, the Jeunesse d'Esch, has won the Luxembourg Football Championship 28 times, the most of any team.

Esch is the second city in Luxembourg to be crowned a European Capital of Culture, after Luxembourg City in 1995 and 2007.

Esch2022 aims to celebrate the history of a cross-border region located in the heart of Europe, telling the story of its evolution from the industrial age to today's knowledge society and its future digital potential.

Kaunas is the second-largest city in Lithuania, after the country's capital Vilnius. Between 1920 and 1939, Kaunas was the capital and largest city of Lithuania and today is an important centre of Lithuanian economic, academic, and cultural life.

During the interwar period, Kaunas was nicknamed 'Little Paris' because of its rich cultural life. In particular architecture and design flourished in the city. Both Art Deco and Lithuanian National Romanticism styles are reflected in buildings as well as furniture and interior design of the time. This architecture has received the European Heritage Label, and Kaunas was the first city in Central and Eastern Europe to be designated as a UNESCO City of Design.

The city is home to Kaunas Fortress, one of the largest defensive structures in Europe. The city's arena, the Žalgiris Arena, is the largest indoor arena in the Baltic states. It is named for basketball club, Žalgiris - the most-succesful Lithuanian basketball club, having won 23 Lithuanian championships, 5 Soviet championships and 1 European championship.

Kaunas is the second city in Lithuania to hold the European Capital of Culture title after Vilnius in 2009. During 2022, Kaunas will host around 1,000 cultural events including festivals, exhibitions, performing arts and concerts.

Novi Sad is the second largest city in Serbia, situated in the south of the Pannonian Plain. It lies on the banks of the Danube river. Novi Sad was founded in the 1690s as a strategic military post crossing the Danube, and became an important trading, manufacturing and cultural centre. Its nameНови Садmeans 'new plantation' in Serbian.

In the 19th and early 20th century, Novi Sad was the capital of Serbian culture, earning it the nickname 'Serbian Athens'. Many renowned Serbian writers and publishers have lived or worked in Novi Sad during their careers. The Serbian National Theatre was founded in the city in 1861. Since 2000, Novi Sad is home to one of the biggest music summer festivals in Europe, the EXIT festival.

Novi Sad is the first city in Serbia to hold the European Capital of Culture title.

Its year-long cultural programme includes more than 1,500 cultural events. It aims to further connect the city with the European Union and the Western Balkans, based on eight themes including migration, peace, multiculturalism and the role of women in art and youth culture.

Photographer, globetrotter, influencer

Wilhelm Dreesen was one of the most influential photographers in the 19th century, who travelled the world taking photographs of far-flung places. But almost a century after his death, he and his innovative and award-winning photography have been somewhat forgotten.

That is until recently, whenMuseumsberg Flensburgdiscovered two wooden crates of nearly 300 glass negatives in their collections. The material in these boxes spans Dreesen's entire career all the way back to the 1870s. These negatives - which research shows had not been seen for more than 100 years - have been digitised and are now on display in a newphysicalandonlineexhibition.

Wilhelm Dreesen was born in March 1840 in Rendsburg in Schleswig-Holstein. Both of his parents died while Dreesen was still a child, meaning he grew up in a military orphanage and later joined the military. After retiring from military service in 1865, he founded a photography studio in Flensburg.

The store did so well that he quickly opened branches across the region. Initially successful as a portrait photographer, Dreesen turned to landscape photography as soon as technical progress allowed cameras to be transportable with shorter exposure times. Dreesen was soon one of the pioneers of artistic photography in Germany, taking part in international exhibitions and winning numerous awards.

In 1887, he was appointed Imperial Court Photographer by the Crown Prince and later Kaiser Friedrich III. This honour opened the door to a great career for him.

In the same year, he signed a contract with HAPAG - the Hamburg America Line shipping company - and, from then on, travelled free of charge on their passenger steamers. In return, he made his photographs available to HAPAG for advertising purposes and thus became something like the first influencer. The range ranged from travel brochures with colourised photographs of landscapes and HAPAG steamers to travel guides and exclusive luxury editions of photo documentation that were distributed as gifts to HAPAG first class passengers.

Two decades of adventure at sea followed. Since the business model worked perfectly, Dreesen entered into similar agreements with other shipping companies. The press reported on his travels, books were published, and his pictures aroused the desire to travel.

From 1891, he published not only postcards but also lavishly produced picture albums, which found huge sales across the region and increased his fame as well as his wealth.

In 1895, Wilhelm Dreesen attracted a lot of attention in Norway with his picture album 'Norway the Land of the Midnight Sun', which was also published in Norwegian. His images of the glaciers and fjords of Norway shaped the country's image for decades and made a significant contribution to opening up the country for tourism.

Wilhelm Dreesen used every opportunity to travel the world. Norway was his most frequent destination, but by no means his only one. He travelled to the Mediterranean, Egypt, the Baltic States and Eastern Europe, the United States and the Caribbean.

Hyperinflation in Germany in the 1910s and 1920s meant that Dreesen lost his fortune and died impoverished in Flensburg in 1926. His work was largely forgotten since then - until now.

The glass negatives discovered in the crates have been digitised and are now on display in the exhibition Discovering Dreesen: Photographer, globetrotter, influencerin Museumsberg Flensburg until 13 February 2022. The exhibition will also be on display at theNorwegian Museum of Travel and Tourismin Sognefjord from May to October 2022. The exhibition can also be explored online - in English, German and Norwegian - at the websiteDiscovering Dreesen.

Traditional Chinese garden design connects the realm of the physical with that of the ideal, to express the harmony that should exist between humans and nature.

In China, spirituality has historically been a crucial aspect of arts and architecture. A specific part of art and architecture where the spiritual and the real meet is garden design and horticulture. TraditionalChinese garden designand cultivation is an activity associated with deeply intellectual and artistic practice. The goal of these gardens is to connect the realm of the physical with that of the ideal, to express the harmony that should exist between humans and nature.

The earliest Chinese gardens that have been found date back to the Shang Dynasty, more than three thousand years ago. Traditional Chinese garden design intentionally aims at giving a natural feel to sculpted grounds. A perfect balance between what man conceives and what nature provides is believed to result in spaces for reflection where thoughts and emotions can emerge, freed from everyday stressors. This was especially true after the fall of the Han dynasty in the 3rd Century AD, which led to a period of great political instability. To escape the stress of the outside world, court officials started building gardens where they could reconnect with nature and focus on art and literature.

Not intended to be discovered at a glance, but hoping to continuously incite and surprise, the Chinese garden is laid out as a road of discovery. The surrounding garden wall, ponds with lotus flowers and other water plants, lacquered bridges, bamboo groves, pavilions, temples and pagodas make for inspiring scenery.

Strolling around the garden following small pathways, galleries and corridors leading from structure to structure, a visitor can either actively enjoy the curated landscape experience or choose to sink into contemplation.

As carefully composed tableaux, exquisite vistas are highlighted across the grounds. To this end, dedicated structures are built, offering the best sights of plants, animals or panoramas.

For that same reason, Chinese garden walls and passways are adorned with windows and doors – sometimes round, hexagonal or shaped in the form of a piece of fruit – framing scenes worthy of being marvelled at.

These so-called moon gates are sometimes crowned by inscriptions or decorated with natural motifs, often serving as talismans.

In Chinese gardens, language and calligraphy take pride of place as well: words inscribed on pavilions, proverbs and poems function as extra food for thought. The Tang Dynasty (7th-10th Century AD) is seen as the first Golden Age of the classical Chinese garden. The "Scholar's Gardens" built during this dynasty were meant to inspire, and in their turn be inspired by, classical Chinese poetry and painting.

Yin and Yang are guiding principles: a Chinese garden will want to complement wet elements with dry ones, light patches with shadowy areas, rocky walls with softer, greener zones or flower beds boasting peonies or orchids.

While complementing each other, such opposite elements are not directly confronted but carefully positioned and distinguished from one another.  Symmetry is generally avoided: a quality sometimes perceived as unsettling by early Western visitors.

The irregularity of the Chinese garden, however, is intentional and meticulously planned. As a whole, it represents the idea not of identity, but of harmony between man and nature.

The Chinese philosophy and design of gardens was first reported on in the West by Marco Polo in the 13th century. From the early 17th century onwards, Jesuit missionaries helped to spread the word about the clever and impactful landscaping style, igniting a rage for ‘Chinoiserie’ that would peak in the 1700s.

As interest grew, gardens across Europe began to follow the Chinese model and many a pagoda was erected to add an ‘exotic’ flavor to local green scenes: from Kew Gardens in London toCatherine the Great’s grounds at theTsarskoye Selo palace.

Today, isolated elements from the Chinese garden style are to be found across the world, as a part of the established vocabulary of landscape architecture.

Lilly Steinschneider was born in Budapest in 1891, in the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. She had a comfortable life, the daughter of a well-to-do horsehair-weaving factory owner of Jewish origin.

Her affection for motor sports showed early in her childhood. She strongly believed that one day humans would know how to fly. Louis Blériot, the French aviator who first flew across the English Channel, visited Budapest in 1909. His flight over the Hungarian capital had a great impact on Lilly’s imagination. When she could see with her own eyes that aviation is possible, she immediately decided: she would be a pilot at all costs.

This emancipated and daring young girl chose a kind of sport that was considered to be the privilege of men. Flying demanded abilities that could primarily be associated with masculine characteristics: endurance, bravery and technical knowledge. The early airplanes of the 20th century were open structures - pilots often had to fight extreme weather conditions. Flying was one of the most dangerous sports, where accidents often resulted in death.

Yet Lilly proved fearless. She followed a step-by-step principle and aimed for obtaining a driving license first. To achieve this goal, the young woman needed 200 crowns and she did not hesitate to pawn some of her jewellery. She visited car repair shops in Budapest to study engines. After six weeks of practice, in 1911, she held her driving license in her hand. She was only 20 years old. Most likely she became the first female driver in Hungary. According to the newspapers, it was a great surprise for her parents when their daughter sat in the driver’s seat in the family automobile!

To learn to fly she travelled to Wiener Neustadt, where the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy operated a famous pilot school. In the beginning, she could receive parental financial support as she stayed in Lower Austria under the supervision of a French lady companion. Later she took a job, but still  struggled with financial difficulties, since aviation was a particularly expensive sport.

Lilly learned to fly on an Etrich Taube monoplane designed by Igo Etrich Austrian aircraft developer and flight pioneer.

At first, she became acquainted with flying as a passenger. Newspapers regularly reported about her ground-flights (when apprentices learned how to control airplanes before flying in the air) and later about her flight in the air. She took her pilot exam in August 1912. To celebrate this occasion, an expensive and special piece of jewellery - an airplane-shaped brooch - was designed for her.

Immediately she became famous as the first female Hungarian pilot. Many people were fascinated by the young lady’s aviation skills and bravery. She received numerous congratulatory letters and postcards from Hungary and from abroad as well. Her first public flight was in October 1912 in the Hungarian town Nagyvárad (today in Romania). After landing, two thousand people cheered her enthusiastically and her admirers brought her on their shoulders. She also participated in the International Flying Week in Aspern in 1913. Among the 24 aviators there were only two women, Lilly and Jeanne Pallier from France.

During this contest she was forced to make an emergency landing due to a motor failure. The plane crashed but she escaped the accident unscathed. On the final day of the Flying Week, the French acrobat pilots Maurice Chevillard and Roland Garros made an aerobatic show. Chevillard flew with Lilly on board. We know from Lilly’s memoirs that he turned the plane upside-down so that she  suddenly felt the blood in her head as she was hanging on the seat belt at the height of 1000 metres.

Lilly’s dream to fly in front of an audience in her hometown Budapest came true in 1913. The Hungarian Aero Club organised the 'Aviation Day of Saint Stephen' on August 20 . This exceeded her expectations: she completed the required 2500-metre lap in 1 minute 27 secs and, with this, she won the speed contest. Altogether six different types of race were organised. Lilly came second in the overall qualification, with Viktor Wittmann the winner.

The outbreak of World War I ended civilian aviation, as well as Lilly’s short but all-the-more-valuable pilot career (1912-1914).

Despite difficulties arising from the different social status and the minority of the groom, Lilly married the love of her life, Count Johannes Coudenhove-Kalergi of Ronspergheim, the son of an Austrian diplomat and his Japanese born wife, Mitsuko Aoyama. With this marriage, Lilly became the sister-in-law of Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi, the founder of the Pan-European movement. Since Lilly dreaded the thought of being away from her beloved husband, she followed him to the Eastern front, where she served as a nurse and cared for typhoid patients.

After the war, the couple settled in the Coudenhove-Kalergi family estate in Ronsperg (in Czech Pobezovice), in Bohemia. Longing for a child replaced aviation in Lilly’s mind, and finally, in 1927, her daughter was born by caesarean section.

During World War II, Lilly had to flee because of her Jewish origin and spent some years in Italy together with her daughter in modest material conditions, falling from one illness to another. Separated from her husband, the once happy marriage was broken and ended in divorce. After the war, Lilly moved to Southern France and lived a solitary life.

Lilly Steinschneider - once the owner of the fourth pilot licence of the Hungarian Aero Association, one of the first woman pilots of Europe, who had made a lasting impression during her short sport career - died in her 80s in Geneva in 1975.

Documenting life in Constantinople and the Ottoman Empire

Abdullah Frères was a photography studio in Constantinople (Istanbul), one of the most successful and famed during the late Ottoman Empire.

It was run by three brothers of Armenian heritage - Viçen Abdullahyan (1820–1902) (later known as Abdullah Şükrü after converting to Islam), Hovsep Abdullahyan (1830–1908) and Kevork Abdullahyan (1839–1918).

Over 40 years, the Abdullah brothers took many portraits of different types of people, landscapes, architecture, but also documented various political and social events, historical and cultural values.

The studio existed from the 1850s until the early 1900s. In 1863, the Abdullah Frères were appointed he official court photographers by Sultan Abdulaziz. From 1866 to 1895, the brothers also ran a studio in Cairo, Egypt.

Learn how the Frankish noble family helped popularise and standardise written text as we know it now.

Having spaces and punctuation might seem indispensable in any text today, but in the Middle Ages these were seen as major innovations in writing and reading. Learn how the Carolingian dynasty helped popularise and standardise written text as we know it now

The Carolingian period (9th century) had a huge influence on the intellectual culture of Western Europe because of the reforms enacted during that century, and especially under the rule of the emperor Charlemagne himself. These reforms impacted not only how people were taught to read, but also how written texts were produced across his empire, which extended from Hamburg (present-day Germany) down to Rome (present-day Italy) and Barcelona (present-day Spain).

A few developments in how we wrote and read in the 8th century helped  lay the foundation for the Carolingian reforms. The first — and perhaps most noticeable change — was the introduction of spaces between words. This trend seems to have originated in thescriptoriaof Irish monks during the 7th and 8th centuries and made its way to the continent via manuscripts circulating between different monasteries and churches.

Whereas previously manuscripts were produced in the Greek/Roman style without spaces between words (scripta continua), the European-wide shift to writing with spaces between words (scripta discontinua) spread rapidly.

Below:On the left, example of 9th century scripta discontinua composed by Irish monks - the spaces are not very pronounced yet. On the right, example of late 10th century scripta discontinua - the spaces are significantly more pronounced.

We're not sure why this shift happened: there is no evidence to suggest that it was because it was hard to read Latin texts without spaces, nor that it fostered a shift from reading and writing aloud to silent reading and writing (seePublic and Private Reading). Nevertheless, scripta discontinua writing quickly became the norm.

Another key contribution to writing in the 8th century was the introduction of regulated punctuation. Periods and commas started to be used consistently (though they looked slightly different and served opposite functions from those they serve today).

Charlemagne was a great patron of learning.. Under his reign he saw to the creation of new schools in cities across the Frankish empire, adding to the number of important schools already founded during the preceding Merovingian period (such as the schools in Autun and Lyon). Production and preservation of manuscripts in key monasteries (such as the monastery at Corbie) continued to proliferate under Charlemagne’s rule as well.

Above:List of monk names which place this manucript (BnF Lat. 12957 f. 99v and f.100r) at Corbie in the 9th century.

The Carolingian period also saw significant changes to how texts were written and read. For example, while the Merovingian period saw the standardisation of thepunctus(which is similar to the period) and the comma, question marks were created and came into use during the reign of Charlemagne. Scribes also began to use the inverted semi-colon and expletives (for example in French:et,si) to affect emphasis in their written productions.

Charlemagne also affected sweeping educational reforms in which a key player was the English missionaryAlcuin of York. Both Charlemagne and Alcuin felt that the quality of education in monasteries was slipping. For Alcuin, improvement hinged upon a reform of how Latin was taught and used. He was appalled by the general use of a less 'correct' Latin and focused his educational reform efforts on rigorous implementation of a more 'classical' usage of Latin. Under his guidance the Carolingian period saw a revival of classical Latin.

Alcuin was also instrumental in the transmission of texts across borders. Movement of texts from place to place spread and increased knowledge and contact with  more textual forms, augmenting the educational experiences of pupils in the schools.

Alcuin and Charlemagne's reforms and investments in monastery schools and education had a huge impact on how people wrote and read during the Carolingian period. To this day, we have the Carolingians to thank for the legibility of our texts, for the widespread use of question marks, and for so much more.

Private Reading

Public Reading

People have always practiced private reading (silent) and public reading (out loud, either as performance or reading to an intimate group).

These two different ways to read were never mutually exclusive, and depended on one another for survival and transmission. Just as today we practice private reading with physical books or ebooks, but we also read out loud to one another or listen to audio books.

Medieval people both read privately and were read to. The kind of reading a person practiced at a given time depended on the social situation and their level of education.

Private reading was most easily accomplished, then as now, in quiet and calm environments which allowed readers to focus on the reading material.

Monasteries and abbeys, especially thescriptoria, offered this kind of environment. It is believed that early medieval (5th-7th century)scriptoriawere loud places where one monk (or nun) would read aloud (dictate) to the scribe who then copied what they heard.

However, there are records from the 7th and 8th centuries which show that the rules were altered to demand thatscriptoriabe fully silent environments. This means that monks and nuns were silently reading and copying texts: an aspect of monastic literary culture that did not change again after that.

Libraries were another place where private reading could be easily achieved. Again, monasteries housed libraries, but so did universities (starting in the 12th century) and private residences (late medieval royal or noble most notably).

Universities amassed libraries where students could access copies of books that they were unable to buy for themselves, and which often also housed original copies (the most ‘correct’ versions, that is) of texts. They were not lending libraries, and some of the more important books were kept on chains to prevent students and professors from removing them from the premises.

As a result, university libraries were places where people would read (as they still are today), and thus there was a rule of silence there,  following the example of monasticscriptoria.

Private reading offered several advantages, first and foremost: the possibility for the reader to practicemeditatio(meditation) andruminatio(contemplation).

These were some of the most important aspects of monastic reading (see blog:Monastic vs scholastic reading habits) which required the reader to ruminate over what they were reading. This was particularly useful for digesting complex texts that required close reading and rereading to understand, particularly important to university students in the later Middle Ages. This method of reading lent itself well to people who used the book as a tool (livre-outil).

A distinct disadvantage to private reading — especially according to university masters in the later middle ages — is that it allows the reader a certain degree of interpretive freedom. This made it harder to control heretical ideas.

Public reading was practiced by everyone in the Middle Ages, since it could be practiced almost anywhere and by practically anyone. Some common places where public readings happened were: at royal courts, in intimate groups (not specific to social status), during a performance, in refectories, and during university lectures.

An entire profession existed around public reading in the high Middle Ages: troubadours and jongleurs.

These were the men and women whose job it was to compose and perform stories (romances or epics) and poems to an audience - an audience which could be made up of either nobles or commoners.

Because so many of the tales that have been preserved in writing were meant to be read or recited aloud, they still contain oral traces in writing.

Many romances will start with 'oïez oïez' (hear ye, hear ye) and frequently include phrases such as, 'listen to this tale' or 'I tell you'. The fact that these tales were written down and also that copies of them exist accompanied by images in luxury manuscripts prove that theywerealso read privately by both performersandthe general populace. They were originally and frequently read publicly, giving these texts a dynamic and vibrant readership that was not necessarily dependent on literacy.

Above:a miniature illustrating a university lecture.

Universities were also places where public reading occurred. While students and masters were expected to read privately and contemplate the complex material, university lectures were a public form of doing that. The master would read a text out loud while the students followed along, taking note of the verbal commentary (glosses) the master would make as he read. Thus the art of doing a close reading of a text was as much a public and communal action as a private one.

The advantages to public reading were in the entertainment value (during a performance) and in the discussions with others which could derive from it - both in a university setting and in a lay or courtly setting.

Public reading encouraged the exchange of ideas between readers engaging in the same material at the same time. It also allowed for a larger readership and therefore a more vast dissemination of information and ideas because public reading is not dependent on the literacy of everyone listening.

Reading is both an aural/oral and a visual exercise, both a private and a public activity in the Middle Ages, which is an aspect about reading that fundamentally has not changed in over 1000 years.

Ismail al-Jazari

The Surviving Commission

Leonardo da Vinci

Uncover the story of the 12th century polymath who laid the groundwork for modern engineering, hydraulics and robotics.

After centuries of being side-lined by scholars, it is now widely acknowledged that scientists, artists and philosophers in Renaissance Europe were informed and inspired greatly by the works of their preceding Muslim counterparts. Not only did the latter play a crucial role in preceding much of Western classical invention and thought, but they also made countless ground-breaking discoveries of their own.

The Khalili Collections is home to some of the world’s most important objects from across 1400 years of Islamic culture. Its decades of research and exhibitions have helped spotlight the creative output of Islamic civilisation and its influence on the West.

One of the most fascinating cases is that of the 12th/13th century inventor-artist Ismail al-Jazari, who not only laid the groundwork for modern engineering, hydraulics, and robotics, but recorded his designs in a manner that would excite any enthusiast of Leonardo da Vinci’s notebooks. In fact, it is often claimed they may have inspired Leonardo himself.

Al Jazari worked at the court of the Artuqids in Diyarbakir (in the Mesopotamian region of Jazira), where he became chief engineer. He completed his magnum opus shortly before his death in 1206, in which he recorded 100 beautifully illustrated ingenious devices. These ranged from water-raising machines and clocks to musical robots.

He operated at a time when innovation in science, art and philosophy in the Islamic world was at its peak. The chemistry of Jabir Ibn Haiyan and the mathematics of Al Khwarizmi were already leading to breakthroughs across and beyond the vast lands of Islam. Hisown contemporaries included the great philosophers Ibn Rushd and Ibn Arabi. In fact, Al-Jazari acknowledged the debt his work owed to those that came before him.

In 1206, Al Jazari’sBook of Knowledgebecame available to wealthy patrons who commissioned works based on its designs. Sadly, very few of these early commissions are known to have survived the decades.

One of Al Jazari’s well-known inventions was the first ever four-dial combination lock for a chest or casket. Only five caskets from the early 13th century with such a four-dial combination lock on the lid are known to still exist. One of those, arguably the most resplendent, was created in the early 13th century at the maestro’s birthplace in Jazira and is held at the Khalili Collections.

The combination lock on the Khalili chest, as on the other known examples in the group, mirrors Al Jazari’s design in theBook of Knowledgealmost precisely. In the book, he sketches a chest with four combination lock dials in the four corners of the lid, each using sixteen out of the twenty-eight letters of the Arabic alphabet, representing numbers, in a system known as Abjad numerals. Interestingly, a key trademark of Al Jazari’s lock is the use of letters without a diacritical mark – a point, or sign added to a letter to distinguish it from another similar letter. This is clearly the case on the beautifully preserved dials in the Khalili example.

The Khalili chest is decorated with silver-inlaid scenes depicting courtly pursuits and Christian motifs. Given the period and location of this casket – as well as the intricacy of the artisanship – it is reasonable to assume that it was commissioned by a wealthy Christian patron after Al Jazari’s design. While other examples remain unpublished, and scant information is available about others in the group, the Khalili chest may be the only one bearing decorations which relate directly to Christianity.

The impact of Muslim scientists on Leonardo in general can be seen both implicitly and explicitly throughout his notebooks. His studies into geometric proportions were evidently informed by Thabit ibn Qurra, his work on optics by Ibn Al Haytham (Alhazen) and on mathematics by Al Kindi. More evidently, Leonardo references Ibn Sina (Avicenna) on multiple occasions in his anatomical investigations. In fact, one can even find scribbled on one of his folios what appears to be the head of a Middle Eastern scholar.

Leonardo sought out the patronage of Muslim rulers, such as Ottoman Sultan (Bajazid II)/ He petitioned him with the proposition of several ingenious designs, one of them being a fantastic bridge which would connect Europe and Asia, known today as the Galata Bridge in Turkey.

His appreciation of Muslim scientific innovation, together with his perpetual fascination with mechanical design meant that he must have been familiar with the work of the great canon of Muslim inventors and engineers. The methods of early Islamic inventors such as Abbas Ibn Firnas (who, incidentally, is said to have first attempted human flight, predating Leonardo by half a millennia), the 9th century Banu Musa brothers and the 11th century Ibn Khalaf al-Muradi, were all known to have been celebrated and acknowledged among scholars across Renaissance Europe. It is therefore not much of a leap to think of Leonardo as being astounded and inspired by the thoughts of such a kindred spirit as Al-Jaziri.

One could imagine how Leonardo would have been truly inspired by the fact that Al Jazari illustrated his designs with such artistic flare. Here was a fellow scientific polymath and inventor who developed a visually magnificent way of recording and presenting his designs, letting the wilds of his scientific imagination run free, just like Leonardo had dreamed of doing himself.

Despite Leonardo being by far the most prolific inventor and notetaker of the Italian Renaissance (his work covering over 12000 folios), unfortunately most of his designs were not built to survive to the modern day. But perhaps one could say this was part of the point – like Al-Jaziri, the purpose of designing and depicting such elaborate machines was to push the limits of human imagination and ingenuity. It was a way to dream. And it is this instinct of bold, relentless creativity that binds the greatest thinkers and creators in human history.

In most monastic orders, daily life was communal. Monks and nuns slept, prayed, worked, ate and read together with their brothers or sisters. At all times, their thoughts should have been oriented towards God and the tenets of Catholic faith – even during mealtimes.The Benedictine Rulecontains strict guidelines on how meals had to be organised and what behaviour was (not) tolerated. Meals were served twice a day in the refectory, where the community sat at long tables, and talking was absolutely prohibited, even for the abbot or abbess. Communication, such as requesting food or cutlery, was done through hand signals.

The only member who was allowed to speak was the person appointed to read aloud during that week’s meals. The head of the community, usually the abbot or abbess, was allowed at times to give a short clarification of the text or to instruct the congregation on certain matters. The Rule of Benedict prescribes that good care be taken of the person appointed as reader. They were allowed a cup of diluted wine beforehand, so they would not have to carry out their duties on an empty stomach. Afterwards they were allowed to eat with the monks who were on kitchen service. In the refectory there often was a special place reserved for the reader and their books, such as a lectern or even a stone pulpit.

The Rule emphasises that the reader should be able to teach; that is to say, their reading and singing should be understandable to others. They were chosen not by rank or seniority, but by ability, and their service began after Mass on Sunday, when they would ask God’s blessing in the fulfilment of their duties by thrice singing the first words of Psalm 51: ‘Lord, open my lips and my mouth shall proclaim your praise’.

Below:A detail from a Cistercian Bible from Ten Duinen Abbey, showing the verse sung by new readers (column B, first line: D[omi]ne, labia mea ap[er]ies) (Bruges, Public Library, Ms. 2, f. 172r)

What was read aloud during meals? Unlike other parts of the day where reading was compulsory or encouraged, such as during Mass, theOffices, and self-study, Benedict did not prescribe the type of literature suitable for this occasion. From the twelfth century, fixed collections of texts were created that corresponded with liturgical dates, and biblical texts (and the medieval commentaries on them) were important. Lives of saints, or hagiographies, were also deemed particularly suitable, for they provided examples on how to live. In particular, the lives of theChurch Fatherswere popular. They were compiled by John Cassian, an important figure in early Christian monasticism.

On entering a monastery, one’s main purpose in life became ‘to love the Lord God with the whole heart, the whole soul and the whole strength’, according to the Rule of Benedict. Serving God meant praying and working, but also embodying the virtues of Christianity. Studying the Bible and other authoritative texts, memorising them word by word, and applying the lessons to one’s own improvement, was fundamental. Even during meals – an opportunity to nourish oneself physically after hours of praying, reading, writing or other kinds of labour – spiritual nourishment was also ensured.

Sisters who chronicled early 20th century life in Suriname

Sisters Augusta and Anna Curiel were photographers, the owners of Suriname's most famous photography studio.

Augusta was born in 1873 in Paramaribo, Suriname which was then a colony of The Netherlands.

The Curiels receiving commissions and royal warrants which documented important events and daily life in Suriname for almost forty years in the early 20th century.

Curiel's mother, Henriette Paulina Petronella Curiel, was born in enslavement. Nothing is known about the family's father. The family were members of the Evangelical Lutheran Church and known to be part of the upper-classes of society in coloninal Suriname. Augusta and Anna's brother Adolf was a member of the 'States of Suriname', the colonial parliament of Suriname.

In 1904, Augusta and Anna opened their photography studio and shop in a building behind their home (which can be seen in the photograph above).

Both had a role to play in the photography. Anna was a technically gifted photographer, with a great eye for composition and lighting. Anna's role was in developing the photographs and important preparation work like setting up the cameras and tripods. They can be seen at work in the centre of this photograph.

The Curiels took their photographs in their studio, in government buildings, factories, mines, on plantations and in schools and orphanages. They always worked on commission. This means that their photographs give the positive impressions wanted by the organisations and individuals commissioning them, and may not accurately reflect realities.

Nonetheless, Augusta and Anna's photography is a unique picture of life in early 20th century Suriname.

This photograph was commissioned to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Surinamese Bank. George Calkoen, the bank's director, is sitting in the middle.

This posed photograph was commissioned by the Boom-Gongrijp family. The group's costumes suggest that this may be a theatrical performance.

These two photographs of a wedding party dates from betweeen 1903 and 1908.

This photograph shows a number of Creole fishmongers and fishermen with their boat. It was taken around 1915.

The name of the woman in this photograph is not known. She is wearing a koto, a traditional dress worn by Afro-Surinamese or Creole women in Suriname.

Queen's Day (Koninginnedag) (now King's Day) is an annual celebration in the Netherlands of the monarch's birthday. This photograph shows the celebrations in Paramaribo around 1900 for Queen Wilhelmina's birthday.

This photograph shows a demonstration in Paramaribo in 1931 by people who are unemployed, due to the economic crisis of the time.

This photograph dates from the mid-1920s, and shows workers of a factory in Moengo, posing near a locomotive on the factory site.

This photograph from 1906 shows a Surinamese nanny with two European children.

Learn about the intrigue, spying, and political and religious opposition that would lead the Jesuits to be banned from China for almost 100 years.

You might have heard of the Chinese zodiac, made up of 12 animals each representing one year in the 12-year cycle of a lunar calendar. One of the most famous depictions of these zodiac signs comes in the form of12 bronze zodiac animal headsthat used to be part of an ingeniously crafted water clock fountain. These bronzes, stolen during the looting of the Summer Palace in the second Opium War, were not designed and crafted by the Chinese, but were made by Jesuits. But how did Jesuits end up constructing a whole Western Pavilion in the Imperial Gardens of Beijing?

In the 17th Century the Jesuit order had succeeded in gaining the favour of the Chinese emperor, starting a long tradition of cultural exchange between the West and China. Possessing knowledge of astronomy and mathematics, The Chinese entrusted Jesuits with important missions, among which was the establishment of a more precise calendar. The German JesuitAdam Schall(1592-1666) was put in charge of the imperial observatory of Beijing, as wasFerdinand Verbiest(1623-1688), a Flemish missionary.

Jesuits created engines to calculate the movements of the stars and telescopes to observe them. They also used their knowledge of geography to create intricate maps.

To respond to the Chinese interest in western technology, Jesuit scholars wrote books concerning science, physics and mechanics, and translated works by important historic mathematicians such as Euclid and Pythagoras into Chinese.

Another important contribution of the Jesuits is to be situated in the field of the arts,  including painting, architecture, gardening and music. They combined European  artistic practices, such as oil painting and portrait art, with Chinese techniques such as ink painting on silk. The French painterJean Denis Attiret(1702-1768) produced several portraits of officials and ladies of the Qing court. One of his most famous works is theportrait of empress Ulanara(1718-1766), second spouse of emperor Qianlong.

But the most famous Jesuit artist wasGiuseppe Castiglione(1688-1766), better known in China as Lang Shining, who was a member of the imperial academy of arts. His fabulous roll paintings and portraits represent a genuine fusion of western and eastern art. He was also a personal friend of emperor Qianlong, who stands in history as one of China’s greatest emperors and a generous patron of art and science.

It was ultimately in the field of architecture that the Jesuits would create their grandest masterpieces in China. During the Qing dynasty, the Forbidden City was only used from November to February, as a Winter Palace. The rest of the year, the court spent time in various other places and mansions. But their favourite residence was situated north of the capital and called “Gardens of Perfect Brightness” (Yuanmingyuan), known today as theOld Summer Palace.

Inside the Old Summer Palace, Giuseppe Castiglione and the French JesuitMichel Benoist(1715-1774) created a complex of pavilions and gardens inspired by French gardens and Baroque style architecture.

Also accomplished by the Jesuits were the so-called Western Mansions (Xiyang Lou) or the “Versailles of the East”: one of the most famous palaces of China. The estate included a labyrinth, a belvedere, pools and several fountains. One of the most famous water features was the “Water Clock”, consisting of twelve statues depicting Chinese zodiac animals spouting water to indicate the time.

This complex was an interesting mixture of Chinese and Western styles, answering to the taste for western exotism that emperor Qianlong harboured, much in the same way Europeans were thrilled byChinoiseries.

But not everything was perfect in the relationship between China and the ‘Soldiers of God’. A less elevated role was played by Jesuits operating as spies. Some were specifically dispatched to investigate how porcelain was produced.  While both the Chinese and Europeans were interested in learning from each other when it came to science and technology, they didn't always see eye to eye on matters of religion. The “Chinese Rites controversy” perfectly illustrates the misunderstandings between these two cultures.

In 1715,Pope Clement XIcriticized the fact that Chinese converts were allowed to continue to honor their family ancestors. In his view, these rituals were not compatible with catholic liturgical practices. The Jesuits tried to justify their approach, but the pope persisted in his opposition and  wanted to eradicate the possibility of celebrating mass in Chinese instead of Latin as well. While Rome couldn’t understand the full extent of  Chinese rituals, the emperor of China became angry, too, understanding  that the Jesuits were still seeking to convert his people.

Remaining appreciative of the Jesuits’ knowledge of science and arts, the Chinese sovereign approved anti-Christian policies against the Chinese converts. In the end, Jesuits were banned from China in 1774, one year after the dissolution of their order in Europe. They were to return to China only in the 19th century. By then, power in China had been seized by the West, which was a much more favourable situation for the Jesuits' goals of conversion and of building schools, hospitals and orphanages.  The last Jesuits fled China in 1949, when the communists came to power.

The collaboration between the Jesuits and the Chinese is a valuable testament to the benefits of two cultures working together, producing marvelous works of art and achieving important breakthroughs in science. Today, still, Europe and China collaborate in many domains - including scientific research and art - continuing the tradition started over 600 years ago.

Monastic annals and the evolution of medieval historiography

The concept of a monastery as a repository of ancient and rare information is a popular one in western culture. Perhaps most famously depicted in Umberto Eco’sThe Name of the Rose, monastic locations have featured in popular series such asThe Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and Game of Thrones. Despite this, historiography – that is the writing of history – is probably one of the last types of texts that come to mind when one tries to imagine what was being written and read in medieval monasteries. Nonetheless, it was at monasteries that historiography was cultivated and intensively used. Most of our knowledge about the early Middle Ages comes from texts written in those communities. The relationship between monastic life, the calculation of time, and the writing of history is the subject of this blog.

Monastic life was governed and structured by liturgy and the canonical hours. Every day, eight fixed moments of prayer were observed, known as 'hour',and over the course of a week, the totality of the 150 Psalms was sung during services. Important events such as Christmas, Lent, Easter, and All Souls, were celebrated with significant liturgical services or additional rituals. But some of these events have no fixed date on the calendar;  the date of Easter, for instance, depends on the phases of the moon and the beginning of spring. Rather than calculating these dates anew, year after year, astronomical and mathematical knowledge was combined in the creation of Easter Tables: lists of years with the respective dates of Easter.

These lists were kept by churches, monasteries and other religious institutions to know when to celebrate the important feasts. Over time, they were supplemented with incidental remarks on notable events of that year. These could be anything, but mostly discussed coronations, deaths, natural phenomena, and events within the author’s own monastery. The entries became longer and more detailed, as well as more narrative in style and tone. By the ninth century this framework had been fully developed and the genre was found throughout continental Europe, known as annals or annales (‘year books’).

Below:An early copy of the Annals of Petau, showing the short entries for each year (beginning with ‘Anno’)

The scope and the reading of these annals was not restricted to monastic circles. Despite the monastic ideal of solitude and distance from secular affairs, monasteries were very much part of the political and intellectual fabric of the Carolingian era. As intermediaries between humans and God, monks and nuns were constantly asked to pray: for a deceased loved one, for the wellbeing of a realm, for victory in battle. In return they were granted wealth and ownership of large estates. Bishops and abbots frequented the imperial courts and held important positions through which they could influence politics. Monks led the palace schools and taught the sons of nobles reading, writing and literature. Vice versa, emperors presided over church councils and actively engaged in theological debates.

Below:Artist’s impression (ca. 1942) of daily life in the imperial palace in Aachen, ca. 800. Three clerics, recognizable by their white pallium, can be spotted, advising the king and teaching the youth.

Much of what know about France and Germany in the eighth and ninth centuries – a time when both territories formed part of the Carolingian Empire – comes from annals. The most famous of these are the Royal Frankish Annals, the Annals of Fulda, the Annals of Saint-Bertin, the Annals of Saint-Vaast and the Annals of Lorsch. Despite some differences in scope and detail, due to their geographical location (e.g. Saint-Bertin is located in northern France, while Fulda is in central Germany), these annals present a coherent narrative.

Below:A fragment from the Annals of Fulda, containing entries for the years 871, 872 and 876.

The usefulness of historiography was well understood by the Carolingian rulers. They turned it into a political tool to cleverly legitimise their ascent to power. The dynasty of the Carolingians had only recently acquired power after Charlemagne’s ascent to the throne. Before that, they were the ‘Mayors of the Palace’ (a sort of prime minister) to the previous Frankish dynasty, the Merovingians. In 751, Charlemagne’s father Pepin the Short staged a coup and deposed the last Merovingian king, taking the throne for himself.

The Royal Frankish Annals portrayed the Merovingians as ineffective, weak rulers and claimed that as Mayors of the Palace, the Carolingians effectively exerted real power, with the last Merovingian kings being little more than puppets. The legitimacy of the new dynasty was further enhanced by emphasising two elements: the Pope’s approval of the transferral of power, and Pippin’s official election by the Franks, as was ancient custom.

Above:A fictionalised 17th-century depiction of Childeric III, the last Merovingian king. The text at the top right shows the might of the Carolingian Mayors: it relates how Childeric was placed on the throne by Charles Martel and nine years later was forced into a monastery by Pippin the Short.

Thus, medieval historiography had its origin in monastic circles. While this may appear surprising at first sight, it is a logical consequence of the need to calculate the dates of Easter, the desire to keep track of the history of one’s own community, and the increasingly secular role that monasteries played in the early Middle Ages. Somewhere along the way, historiography diverged from its original liturgical function and became an important genre of its own.

In the fall of 1860, at the end of theSecond Opium War, French and British troops decided to loot and burn the Old Summer Palace in Beijing in response to the torture and execution of British and Indian soldiers by the Chinese. The destruction of the imperial residence was a warning to the Chinese government not to resist Western powers. This event not only shocked China but Europe, too, as writer Victor Hugo's letterAu capitaine Butler(‘To Captain Butler’)- openly  criticizing  the brutality of the French troops - demonstrates. The most famous part of the palatial complex in Beijing, a garden 'à la française' boasting European-style buildings, was created for the delight of the Chinese emperor by European missionaries from theSociety of Jesus. This, in sharp contrast with the raid described above, was a testimony to how two cultures were able to create beauty by working together.

The Society of Jesus, better known as the order of Jesuits, was a society founded in 1539 byIgnatius of Loyola(1491-1556) with the aim to convert the world to Catholicism. Christianity had already reached China in the 7th century with theNestorians. In the 16th century, when the first Jesuits arrived, China was  under the rule of the Ming dynasty. Their first settlement was the port-city of Macao in South China, at that time owned by Portugal. From this base,  the Jesuits entered the Chinese  hinterland and began their work of conversion. While establishing churches at different locations, they even started fostering the dream of converting the Chinese emperor himself.

One of the most famousJesuits in Chinawas the ItalianMatteo Ricci(1552-1610).To get the Chinese interested in Catholicism, Ricci and his colleagues adopted the manners of the elite, thinking that if they would convert, commoners would follow. The Jesuits started dressing like scholars, studied Chinese language and culture, and became what we now consider the first sinologists in history. They also realized that their Western knowledge of mathematics, astronomy and mechanics could play a part in attracting the Chinese to the catholic faith.

The science of stars was important in ancient China, as it was not only used to predict the future, but also to help determine good and bad days and the seasons. In 1601 Matteo Ricci became the first European ever to get invited by the emperor of China to the imperial palace of the Forbidden City. The meeting must have been a great success since Ricci was given permission to build the first cathedral in Beijing. He also gained persistent access to the imperial palace, allowing him to meet Chinese officials as well as the emperor, who lived a very reclusive life.

This prosperous relationship came under pressure in 1644, when the Ming dynasty was replaced by the family of the Qing (1644-1912). The Jesuits feared they would be denied the privilege to stay in China, but the new rulers understood the benefits of keeping them in service.

The Qing period turned out to be a true “golden age” for the Jesuits. Under the reigns ofKangxi(1654-1722),Yongzheng(1678-1735) andQianlong(1711-1799), they  created a vast body of artworks and made significant contributions to science. Through their writings, furthermore, the Jesuits presented a positive image of China to Europe, as opposed to that painted by the merchants who, at the time, were biased by the difficulties they had in trading with China.

At all times the Jesuits kept the conversation with their home base going, sending letters, writings and translated books. They also authored books and articles about China, its customs and traditions, sharing with Europe their impressions of the empire.

During their stay in China, the cultural exchange between Jesuits and Chinese would result in advances in astronomy and mathematics, beautiful works of art, and shining beacons of architecture. This centre of acculturation was not without its issues, however: read our next blog to learn about the intrigue, spying, and political and religious opposition that would lead the Jesuits to be banned from China for almost 100 years.

Cicero and rhetorical teaching

Cicero the philosopher

Rhetorical and philosophical teaching of Marcus Tullius Cicero

Marcus Tullius Cicero (106-43 BCE) was one of the most notable figures in Roman history. As a contemporary of Caesar, Cato and Pompey, Cicero witnessed the end of the Roman Republic and the beginning of the career of Octavian, later the first ‘emperor’ Augustus. His gruesome death was directly linked to the political turmoil of his time.

Not everyone who refers to Cicero today has his full political biography in mind. Since antiquity, the name Cicero has been a synonym for rhetorical excellence. For example, journalists often compared Barack Obama’s speeches to Cicero’s eloquent orations. Cicero has had a huge impact on the cultural development of western Europe. The hundreds of manuscripts in which his texts survive are tangible proof of his influence on rhetorical and philosophical teaching and thought in the Middle Ages.

Cicero was famed for his eloquence and many students of Latin have learned the language with his speeches and rhetorical handbooks.

Especially important was Cicero’sDe inventione, a systematic treatise on how to find fitting arguments to express one’s point of view. In the Middle Ages, it was used regularly as a handbook for teaching rhetoric, and this is why we have such a huge amount of medieval manuscripts that contain this text. Some are heavily annotated (see above); others are smaller and less expensive pocket editions.

De inventionewas widely read, but in order to fully appreciate it, one needed commentaries that explained the content in more detail or applied it to the needs of one’s own time. The first huge commentary (which we can still read today) stems from late antiquity, almost 400 years after Cicero’s death. It was written by Marius Victorinus, a teacher of rhetoric and a contemporary of Augustine, who mentions him in his Confessions. In the twelfth century, the ‘magister’ Menegaldus wrote another influential commentary, demonstrating the continued engagement with Cicero’s rhetorical doctrine.

Cicero was not only a famous orator. He also composed philosophical treatises that discussed moral and metaphysical questions. Medieval readers were especially interested in them because Cicero summarised the opinions of Greek philosophers like Plato and Aristotle, and the thoughts of philosophical schools like the Stoics and Epicureans. During the Middle Ages, knowledge of Greek was very limited in western Europe so Cicero’s texts served as an important source for the Greek philosophical tradition.

Cicero the philosopher, however, was also interesting for his own sake. His moral treatise De officiis – about how to fulfill one’s duties as citizen and human being – became especially influential from the 14th century onwards, when the early Italian Renaissance turned Cicero into a model of civic excellence, a role model for humanists, especially in Republican Florence.

Already in late antiquity Cicero’s philosophical texts were commented upon, as were his rhetorical treatises. The most influential is probably Macrobius’s neoplatonic commentary on the end of Cicero’s dialogueDe re publica. In the so-calledDream of Scipio, one of the interlocutors, Scipio Aemilianus, is lifted up while dreaming towards the heavens. There he meets his ancestor Scipio Africanus the Elder, who predicts his future and shows him the earth, planets and stars. Macrobius’s text was an important source in the Middle Ages for philosophers and cosmographers alike.

Cicero’s works have proven to be an inspiration and source of knowledge for generations. Digital versions of his writings, available in Europeana and other online collections, help preserve this heritage and make it accessible to a broad audience.

A guidebook to 'the finest golf course'

Golfers come from all over the world to play the Old Course at St Andrews. It's the oldest golf course in the world, where the game has been played since the 15th century.

Most will arm themselves with a guidebook on how to play the notoriously difficult course. This 1932 guide - competitively priced at six pence - would have been available at John Menzies newsagent in St Andrews and handily at WH Smith at King's Cross Station, London, so those making the pilgrimage to St Andrews by train could do some preparation on the journey. The guide was revised annually for many years -  if you visit St Andrews today, you won't have to search hard for a contemporary book with similar contents and title.

The book opens with several pages of advertisements for hotels catering to the visiting golfer. These include the Dunvegan Hotel which continues to trade under that name today. Like most of St Andrews, it looks very much the same as it did back in 1932.

The cover features a quote 'The finest golf course I have played' from Bobby Jones (1902-1971), the most famous golfer of the day and probably the overseas golfer most associated with St Andrews. Jones' relationship with the course went from initial hatred to a deep love and awe. The guide quotes extensively from Jones' classic bookOn golf.

'When I first played there in 1921, I was unable to understand the reverence with which the place was regarded by our British friends. I considered St Andrews among the very worst courses I had ever seen and I am afraid I was even disrespectful of its difficulties. The maddening part of the whole thing was, that while I was certain the course was easy, I simply could not make a good score. Self complacently, I excused myself by thinking the course was unfair, that the little mounds and undulations should not be there, and because my shots were deflected continually away from the hole, I regarded myself as unlucky. …. In the interim between 1921 and my next visit to Britain in 1926, I heard such a great deal of St Andrews from Tommy Armour and other Scotsman, who seemed to be convinced that Divine Providence had had a part in the construction of the course, that I went there determined to make an effort to like it. I really did not have to try very hard. Before I had played two rounds, I loved it, and I love it now'

This love was no doubt helped by the fact that he won the Open on the Old Course in 1927, and a love reciprocated as he was made a Freeman of St Andrews in 1958.

The guide combines notes on how to play the course with detailed illustrations of all eighteen holes so the first-time player is forewarned about the bunkers, mounds, streams, rough and other hazards they will face on the Old Course.

Once they have completed that first round, the novice can join the debate as to which is the most difficult bunker in the world to get out of. Is it the Hell Bunker, one of nine bunkers on the 14th hole or the Road Hole Bunker on the 17th? (That is also known as the Sands of Nakajima as Japanese professional golfer Tsuneyuki Nakajima had the misfortune of ending up in it.)

This is a pamphlet, but it would be  possible to write an encyclopaedia about the Old Course. Indeed, the literature about the course, its history and many challenges would fill many shelves in the great library of golf.

The Old Course has changed little since 1932 so this guide would still be useful today. Other books might provide more context or poetry, but few would be so practically useful to the aspiring visitor. Whilst you are unlikely to play tennis on Centre Court at Wimbledon, baseball at Wrigley Field or step out bat in hand on Melbourne Cricket Ground, anyone with a reasonable golf handicap can in theory play the Old Course.

Unchanging but ever-changing, it reveals new sides to its character every time it is played, as Bobby Jones would surely have agreed. Perhaps the most useful part of the book is not the plans of the holes, but these words by Jones.

'There is always a way at St Andrews although it is not always the obvious way, and in trying to find it, there is more to be learned on this British course than in playing a hundred ordinary American Golf Courses.'

Differences in medieval readers approaches

With the establishment of universities, the 13th century saw a major change of reading habits amongst the literate (that is, those who could read Latin) elite.

Amongst the medieval literate elite, there were two major methods of reading: monastic and scholastic, each divided into three ‘levels’. Monastic reading consisted oflectio/meditatio/contemplatio- that is: reading / meditation / contemplation. This method was primarily concerned with memorisation and enlightenment through repetition and deep reading (contemplation). To read this way was to know by memory and intimately understand a very few books in their entirety.

Monastic reading was popular in the early Middle Ages (through the 12th century) and, as the name suggests, practiced extensively in monastic communities (male and female alike).

Scholastic reading  appears in the 13th century and proliferates in universities, growing in popularity throughout the late Middle Ages. It comprised oflegere/disputare/praedicare, or: reading / discussing / presenting. The emphasis here was on a person’s capacity to read widely and to be able to pull choice quotes from important works to use in intellectual debates (disputatio) or lectures. 
With an increasing emphasis on an individual’s  ability to cite a vast number of key quotations, rather than having a critical understanding of the context and tradition of said quotations, reading became more fragmented in scholastic milieux. As a result, the ‘collection’ (similar to what we call ananthologytoday) as a ‘genre’ was created during the scholastic period.

University students and masters were no longer concerned with reading a few entire texts and memorising them, but instead with having easy access to ‘key passages’ in many texts which could be used as ‘authorities’ in debates and treatises.

In order to find the specific passage or quote, reading aids and methods had to be devised so that a person could find a specific place in a text easily, without having to read the whole work - since that information was stored on a page and not in their mind.

Luckily, reading aids like chapter headings (sometimes included as running titles - the appearance of the title of a book or chapter at the top of each page) existed already. They were originally used by patristic authors (c. 100-450) to make reading scriptures (finding the correct passage) easier, and then these same techniques were taken up elsewhere in order to facilitate the reading of patristic commentaries on the scriptures. Eventually, the use of chapter headings and running titles spread to other domains with the rise of scholasticism, including but not limited to:disputatio(debates),summae(a compendium of theology, philosophy, or canon law), and even vernacular reading (likeromanz).

The Scholastic period also took the concept of  ‘table of contents’ from Bible manuscripts and developed it into something like what we know today. Pictured below is a 14th century table of contents:

Each entry corresponds to the rubrics - a reading aid that had already existed but started to be used extensively from the 13th century onward - which can be found throughout the text. The wordrubriccomes from latin 'rubrica', meaning 'red colour'; they get this name because they refer to short introductory phrases written in red ink. The visual difference between red and black ink made rubrics stand out, meaning that they were easy to find without having to read the whole text, and thus allowed readers to find their place in a text easily.

Unlike today, medieval readers did not use page, orfolio, numbers to locate different sections of a text, since folio numeration was not standard, and not even necessarily permanent within a given manuscript. In luxury editions, the rubric would be accompanied by an illumination to mark the beginning of a chapter, providing the reader with ample visual stimulation to help divide up the text.

Another way that scholastic reading further dismembered texts was through marginal notes to indicate important passages or note a relevant citation from a related work. See below marginal commentary and amanicula- the hand pointing to indicate important information, which is a particularity of late medieval manuscripts - at bottom left of the image below.

Marginal notes would be taken either by scholars studying a text to prepare for disputatio or during the composition of their own written work, or by students at university during a lecture as they read along with the master and listen to his argumentation on the topic. Thus, we see how medieval people actively became more focused on studying brief, specific passages of many texts with the rise of scholastic reading, and less on deep contemplation of a single text.

Post-war rebirth

The Netherlands is one of the smallest countries of Europe. Despite this modest size, over the years, it has become the second largest agricultural exporter in the world (after the United States). The Netherlands generates around €25 billion a year by exporting meat, dairy produce and vegetables. When and how did this happen, and how was this major transformation reflected on TV?

After World War II, the Dutch landscape underwent major changes.
To stop the famines that occurred during the occupation by Nazi Germany, a new paradigm called ‘nooit meer honger’ meaning ‘no hunger again’ was applied to food production. This involved new policies focusing on efficiency, optimisation, food abundance and self-sufficiency. The tools and processes intended to achieve these goals included fast industrialisation, mechanisation, farmer specialisation and larger farms. These reforms proved very effective, with productivity soaring as a result. In 1962, Irish TV reported on the exceptional Dutch fruit and vegetable production.

The reforms were the vision of Sicco Mansholt, the Dutch Minister of Agriculture in the late 1940s and 1950s. Dutch agriculture became associated with large scale industrialised and specialised farms that increased productivity whilst decreasing the need for continuous heavy farming.

Mansholt’s efforts were regularly shown in newsreels showing the state’s support in pushing agriculture forward. In this excerpt from 1952, we see the minister opening a new space in the complex of The Company Laboratory for Soil and Crops Research "Mariëndaal" in Oosterbeek.

Today, two-thirds of the total land area of the Netherlands is used for agricultural purposes. Grassland extends over half of this agricultural land, while arable farming represents a quarter. Given the small size and high density of the Netherlands, such an agricultural system has had a major impact on nature in and around these farmlands.

Over recent years, unforeseen environmental issues have come to the surface, revealing that the productivity paradigm needs to be replaced with one that sustains and protects nature.

A major consequence of industrialised agricultural practice is the loss of biodiversity. For example, bird species inhabiting farm areas have apparently declined by more than 70% since 1960. Intensive farming has caused their bird habitats to deteriorate, affecting nutrition, nesting and chick survival.

To remedy this situation, the Dutch government has proposed various measures over recent decades. For example, this TV programme shows a farmer who decided to sell his land to the state for conversion into a nature reserve. But are such measures sufficient to restore biodiversity?

Since 2019, the negative impact of nitrogen deposits on the biodiversity of nature reserves has been a key concern of environmentalists and soil scientists. And since the Dutch agricultural sector is responsible for the largest release of nitrogen in the environment, a new vision has been formulated to counterbalance and decrease this trend.

Carola Schouten, the Dutch Minister of Agriculture since 2017, has set out to advocate for the wide adoption of circular agriculture in the Netherlands, also called ‘Kringlooplandbouw’. It is intended that, by 2030, the Netherlands will be a leader in circular agriculture. This means that both the cycles of resources (nutrients, water, etc.), as well as the agricultural production methods, will be optimised to be as efficient as possible.

To learn more about circular agriculture, watch this webinar by Dr. Saskia Visser, Head of Program in Circular and Climate Neutral Society at Wageningen University and Research.

How a ski jump symbolises Lithuanian sport and tourist history

Zarasai is a city in northeastern Lithuania. In this blog, Kęstas Vasilevskis of the Zarasai Regional Museum introduces the history of a ski-jump built in the 1930s and its role in the region's sport and tourist heritage.

For three years during World War I, Zarasai was just behind the German frontline. After that war and the 1918–1920 Lithuanian Wars of Independence, the city - which between 1918 and 1929 was officially known as Ežerėnai - was devastated and struggled to recover.

The constant requisitions of resources, artillery barrages, wounded and dead soldiers had been part of daily life during World War I. When that war ended, the struggle was not over.

In 1919, the Bolsheviks came and were later pushed out, and Poland occupied part of the region, including the Vilnius to Saint Petersburg railway which was a vital line for communication and industry. The situation in Zarasai was very difficult, with an absence of fertile soil, and minimal existing industry also playing a part.

The natural beauty of the region’s nature - lakes, woods and hills - were very well-known to Lithuanians.

Many notable Lithuanians have memories of visiting the region to spend their holidays. In magazines from the inter-war period, many articles glorify the region’s beauty, referring to it as a 'Lithuanian Switzerland'.

In the early 1930s, the region's authorities decided to develop Zarasai to make it more attractive for tourists.

In 1932, Zarasai received an 'official resort area' status allowing new development to begin. One of the municipality’s first decisions was to encourage building of villas around the nearby lake Zarasaitis.

That same year, the local newspaperZarasų Kraštaspublished the municipality’s announcement, which stated that the municipality would cheaply rent the lands around the lake. In exchange, the renter would be obliged to build a villa there and provide accommodation services.

An open air pool in lake Zarasaitis was a project of that era, which still survives today, enjoyed by locals and tourists. It has since been upgraded with a diving tower. Today, it is the only example of tourist infrastructure from the 1930s that can still be used and enjoyed.

In 1937, the municipality finished building a villa, Užuovėja, which was an official winter sport station. During the 1930s, three villas were built but, unfortunately only Užuovėja survived World War II. After the war, it was turned into a two-storey wooden apartment building where people continue to live today.

The Zarasai ski jump tower was the municipality’s grand tourism infrastructure project. It was unique, the first such construction in Lithuania.

The tower was completed in 1937, reaching 40 metres in height.

It was built on a hill which locals know as The Scouts’ Hill. It got this name in 1935, when local scouts planted a lot of trees on the hilltop and built a carved stone to commemorate the scouting movement.

Not long after the grand opening, in 1938, the first major competitions were held there - the SELL Winter Olympics. SELL is a Lithuanian abbreviation for the participants who came from Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.

Unfortunately, the tower was not built very well. When a Swedish ski jumper died in an accident, an investigation found major construction spoilage was found. The tower was closed down for ski-jumping, but people still would climb it as an observation tower.

During World War II, the hill was a Wehrmacht position, with trenches nearby the tower dug by the soldiers of Nazi Germany to fortify their position.

From the tower’s height, they could see the surroundings and the Red Army’s positions. In 1944, the soldiers blew up the tower. Allegedly, they did that because the high ski jump tower was an orientation point for the Red Army artillery.

Small Format Bibles

Bat books/Almanacs

A diverse array of readerships existed over the span of the approximately 1000 years that makes up the Middle Ages. Manuscripts show how the needs of the readership (their reading habits) influence the way books were made. One of the more radical and notable changes occurred in the 13th century : that is, the increasingly frequent production of small format books.

Bibles are, unsurprisingly, the most frequently produced books in the Middle Ages (and still are today). While the late Antique and early Medieval period saw the production of portable gospels (that is, a portable book containing a single Gospel), manuscripts produced in this period containing all the biblical texts (calledRoman Bibles) consist of three main characteristics: (usually) good quality parchment, sumptuous decorations,  large size (parchmentandtext).

The average Roman Bible was about 50 cm in height. These books were heavy and cumbersome, and not meant for transportation. It was not infrequent that one manuscript only contained (at most) half of the Bible; if someone wanted thewholetext of the Bible, they would have to carry around not one buttwoof these large books.

Roman bibles were more than likely meant for use inrefectories, or in cathedrals, churches,  or chapels. They were stationary objects that congregations would gather around, rather than being brought out to the crowds. However, with the 13th century came  Mendicant Orders (wandering monks) and university students: two mobile reader groups who required books that could be easily transported.

The Mendicants were wandering friars, who travelled from township to township preaching. They had no fixed place of residence, and relied on charity for survival.

In the 13th century, the vast majority of university students would come from all corners of Europe to study at the University of Paris. During their time at the university, many would send books back to their hometown as gifts to institutions or to keep in their personal libraries, and also would take their books back home with them when their studies finished.

While university students required portable books of a wide variety, the Bible remained a staple piece of literature for anyone passing through the university, as well as being the sole literary requirement for mendicant friars. As such, small format bibles, called Gothic Bibles, were created en masse in Paris to accommodate the needs of these two groups. In fact, Parisian production of these manuscripts was so prolific that the medieval name for small format Gothic Bibles was ‘the Paris Bible’.

In comparison to the Roman Bible pictured above (Image 1.Biblia Latina - Prima Pars), this Gothic Bible displays a differentmise en pagetypical of small format bibles of the time. In contrast to the luxurious decoration in large format bibles, small format bibles feature minimal marginal decoration and more compacted script. Additionally, Gothic Bibles were frequently produced on lower quality, thinner parchment making the manuscript lighter and easier to carry.

In addition to bibles, the wandering savants of the Middle Ages relied heavily on astronomical and calendrical calculations for their work. During the Middle Ages, the calendar was organised around the lunar cycle, and thus important time-structuring events (like saints’ feast days) shifted from year to year. Astronomers wrote Almanacs - books full of complex tables detailing astronomical movements (waxing/waning of the moon, eclipses, and so on) - which functioned, effectively, as calendars.

Portable versions of these Almanacs - known as ‘bat books’ by modern scholars - were also created and widely used in the 13th century. Little is known about them, but it is clear that they were likely used by mendicant friars or other travelling church officials and physicians. Bat books allowed ecclesiastics to organise the liturgy from year to year, and allowed physicians to consult the zodiac influence on possible medical prescriptions.

Just like Gothic Bibles, bat books contained necessary information in a compact, small format for ease of transportation. As seen in the above photo, the bat book is 12cm in height and approximately 3-4cm in width when folded. While, like with Gothic Bibles, bat books are written in miniscule, compact script on thin paper, they are even more compact because they are meant to be folded for travel and opened for consultation. Furthermore, they typically contain around 15 pieces of parchment in total, making them light and ideal for travel. Though anyone using a bat book would have known how to read the tables, they also usually included instructions for reading, meaning that every bat book - like every Gothic Bible - contained all the information its owner would need to be able to reference on the go.

Communist propagranda labelled the scandalous scenes 'class struggles'

Antisemitism manifests itself in many ways. We know of the horrors of the Holocaust, ghettoisation, deportation, mass murders by the Nazi Germany during World War II.

However, few people know that there were antisemitic demonstrations in Hungary even shortly after World War II, during the Soviet occupation. Some of these riots accompanied the matches of a Budapest football club MTK (Magyar Testgyakorlók Köre/ 'Circle of Hungarian Fitness Activists'), as the football team was traditionally identified as a 'Jewish' team by its supporters and opponents.

In 1946 and 1947, the MTK football team visited Szolnok (a town in central Hungary) where they played against the local team of MÁV (Magyar Államvasutak/ 'Hungarian State Railway Company'). After both games, a shower of stones was thrown upon the MTK supporters when they were departing. What could have been the reason behind these events, and how did the left-wing workers’ parties, which otherwise united the workers and supporters of MÁV in Szolnok, react?

Although the loss of World War II ended the rule in Hungary of the Arrow Cross Party (the Hungarian national socialist movement) and paved the way for the establishment of a communist dictatorship, the society itself could not be replaced. This is why antisemitic ideas that had poisoned both the urban working class and the rural poor peasants continued to live on and, due to the difficult economic situation and the low standard of living, surfaced from time to time.

However, the communists and their allies could not admit that the members of the proletariat were also antisemites, therefore, they tried to give a new interpretation to antisemitic events by shaping the political discourse.

Football matches against MTK, with their heated atmosphere, provided the perfect setting for the manifestation of hatred. For example, in Szolnok, a game was played in the autumn of 1946, which was won 1:0 by the Budapest team through an own goal scored by the local team. Newspaper reports about the match revealed that the members of the Szolnok audience behaved scandalously.

From the very first minute of MTK players entering the football field, the storm of abuse did not stop … they were shouting their antidemocratic, hateful slogans through a gramophone funnel with full mouths, without any inhibitions … After the game, the players, managers and accompanying supporters from Budapest were severely assaulted. The separate buses and accompanying cars were thrown with a shower of stones. The hooligans set up posts between the sports field and the road, launching their attacks with stone from behind them.

The fistful of stones was not only thrown at the MTK team, but also mistakenly at the car of the officers of the Ministry of Interior who were following them on the bridge over the river Tisza and were therefore in the wrong place at the wrong time.

The newspaper of the Hungarian Communist Party tried to portray the events as if it had been only a few provocateurs hiding in the ranks of the Szolnok audience who were responsible for the incident. However, from the report of another newspaper, it can be seen that it was one of the players of the Szolnok team who started the incitement. 'He was shouting Arrow Cross slogans already in the dressing room before the match, exciting his teammates against MTK.'

As a result, the Hungarian Football Association launched an investigation, and the team of MÁV was banned from playing matches at home until the investigation was completed. As the journalist of the newspaperVilág(World) wrote: 'The tragicomic aspect of the scandalous case is that there is not a single Jewish player playing in MTK currently, and the president of the club who died as a martyr surpassed the much celebrated fascist sport patrons with his readiness for financial sacrifice during the decades of his sport career.'

The communist, social-democratic and peasant party leaders of Szolnok later reacted together to the events. They tried to interpret the undeniable antisemitism of working class sport supporters as a manifestation of class struggle.

According to the reframed narrative, it was the rich, that is, 'bourgeois' MTK fans who were behaving defiantly, and the discontent of the poor 'proletarians' of Szolnok was therefore justified and understandable. The MTK supporters 'with their shiny cars appeared in Szolnok already in the morning, filling the cafés and confectioneries, shouting, roistering. In the eyes of the workers, who were living in great poverty, it was repulsive.' With their cars they 'splattered people with mud', and 'there was a certain bitterness among the poor workers of Szolnok towards the painted women in the boxes and the brightly dressed gentlemen who were merrily drinking and eating during the match.' That is, they stated that it was in fact the rich MTK supporters who were mainly responsible for the scandal.

However, probably no-one expected that within a year, the supporters of Szolnok would again cause a public scandal at another MÁV–MTK match, once again won by the visiting Budapest team.

This antisemitic riot was also reported in detail by the contemporary newspapers. In the impetuous match, MTK took the lead from a penalty. Later, an MTK player hit a shot from the Szolnok team with his hand, but the referee did not award a penalty. 'The audience is violently protesting against the referee. The players are becoming nervous, there is a lot of flapping.'

At the end of the match, due to the flared tempers, stones of the size of half a brick were showered upon the sports field. A stone even grazed the referee’s shoulder. Then, when the visiting team left the Szolnok railway station by train, 'a mass of stones fell upon the train of MTK from a railway bridge. There were no injuries because both the players and their escorts were lying on their stomachs to protect themselves from the shower of stones.'

One year later, in 1948, the match of the MÁV of Szolnok was no longer disturbed by violent anti-Jewish riots, not because the local supporters had changed their views, but because their team had been eliminated from the first division championship, so they could no longer play against MTK.

Documenting LGBTI+ life and activism in Ireland during the 1990s and 2000s

Many of us will remember jubilant scenes from Ireland in 2015 when it became the first country in the world to vote for same-sex marriage through a referendum.

However, Ireland's journey to this landmark moment was long. It was only as recently as 1993 that Ireland decriminalised homosexuality. Particularly through the 1980s and 1990s and 2000s, many activists and campaigns fought for equality.

A 2021 exhibition at theNational Library of Irelandhas explored this time in Irish society.Living with Pride: Photographs by Christopher Robsondocuments LGBTI+ life and activism in Ireland during the 1990s and 2000s, and tells the story of Christopher Robson, who captured – through his personal photography – much of Ireland's remarkable journey toward LGBTI+ equality.

Christopher Robson was a central figure in Irish LGBTI+ activism, helping found the Dublin Lesbian and Gay Men's Collectives, Gay Health Action – the first AIDS organisation in Ireland – and the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network (GLEN).

He played a key role in the decriminalisation of homosexuality, and was pivotal in the introduction of civil partnership and the enactment of State equality legislation. His photographic collection of around 2,000 slides, which capture the LGBTI+ experience at a time when prejudice, discrimination and inequality was commonplace, was donated to the Library in 2015 by Christopher's civil partner, Bill Foley.

Introducing the exhibition, Christopher Robson's civil partner, Bill Foley said: 'Christopher regarded his contribution to the drive towards full equality for Irish LGBTI+ people as among the proudest and most significant achievements of his life. Living with Pride shows our community at its best: joyful, defiant and united.'

Photographs inLiving with Prideinclude LGBTI+ protests in Dublin, Paris and New York, as well as seminal moments in Ireland, including Pride parades and law reform in 1993.

The exhibition which was on display in Dublin in 2021 can also be viewed online, giving visitors a chance to learn more about a man who captured and contributed to Ireland's remarkable trajectory for LGBTI+ equality from decriminalisation and a softening of public attitude to the decisive public vote in the marriage equality referendum in 2015.

Living with Pride was co-curated by Bill Foley, Christopher's partner, and Carol Maddock and Nikki Ralston of the National Library of Ireland. The exhibition was accompanied by a vibrant and varied online events programme which can be enjoyedhere.

The 12th century saw a literary revolution in Europe

The 12th century saw the rise of vernacular literature - a literary revolution in Europe. In actuality, the first vernacular texts appeared on the continent as early as the 8th or 9th centuries, but such examples are rare.

At first vernacular texts were largely written in verse. Popular 12th century genres of vernacular literature includechansons de geste(quite similar to epic poetry, often about war and warriors),romans(romances) in verse (these are the classic tales of knights and chivalry, like the earlier arthurian texts), and troubadour poetry (mostly love poems).

In the 13th century, prose triumphed as more and more vernacular texts were written in prose.

This is whenromans(romances) in prose begin to appear. These were still typically about knights and chivalry, like later Arthurian texts where we find the Holy Grail, as well as chronicles in the vernacular (in particular, chronicles of the Crusades in this form were popular), and translations of Latin texts into vernacular.

Vernacular literature appealed to and was read by a mostly lay (outside of the Church) readership, especially in the 12th and 13th centuries. The rise of vernacular literature reflects the development of a literature which valourises the lay aristocratic moral code which is different from that of the Church authorities. While clerical writing (in Latin) encourages religious values (such as celibacy and poverty), lay writing concerns itself with values such as the chivalric code (for example, how to be a good knight and a good vassal) andfin’amor(what we call ‘courtly love’ today: how to be a good lover).

Despite these seemingly disparate moral values, Latin and vernacular literature continue to influence one another from the 12th century onwards. For example, in the 12th century, Andreas Capellanus wroteDe amorein Latin - a treatise about love and how to practice the art of ‘courtly’ love. Going in the opposite direction, the Grail romances of the 13th century show the gradual Christianisation of courtly literature, as the perfect knight becomes more commonly portrayed as a perfect Christian (chaste and pious), like Galahad, rather than as the perfect lover (complete devotion to his lady), like Lancelot.

With the passing of time, literacy in the vernacular became more common than literacy in Latin, though they both continued to influence and inform one another. As both a symptom and a cause of this shift, the late Middle Ages saw an increasingly vast number of texts translated from Latin into the vernacular.

One of the most deliberate and vigourous projects of translation was instigated by King Charles V of France, also known as ‘Charles the Wise’. He commissioned translations of literature from every historical period and from every branch of literature (science, fiction, theology, etc.). As his contemporaries explain, his commission ensured that both the Latin-speaking clerks and also men who were quite intelligent and well-spoken - but  could not grasp Latin - could read and educate themselves.

Through these translations, Charles V sought to make French the language of both governance and science, in the same way that, in antiquity, Latin became a language of science equally as valid as Greek (thelanguage of science). Because this campaign necessarily expanded French vocabulary and provided access to texts otherwise inaccessible to a number of people, it significantly contributed to the prominence of vernacular texts as opposed to Latin texts in the late Middle Ages.

If you think electric cars are an invention of the 21st Century, think again!

If you think electric cars are an invention of the 21st Century, think again: their popularity now is rivalled by their fame in the first decennia of the 20th Century. Read about the rise and fall of the electric car in a time where Tesla was still preceded by the word Nikola.

The story of the automobile began long before the 1900s, when motorized vehicles became a novelty much coveted by the wealthy, the sporty and the powerful. With the start of the 20th century, the commercial breakthrough of the car was dawning as well. The electric car, in particular, proved to be a hit with the consumer market: other than gasoline and steam-powered cars, the electric versions were silent, practical, and excellent in terms of performance.

These qualities were aptly demonstrated by the car developed byCamille Jenatzy. His automobile nicknamed ‘La Jamais Contente’ (The Never Contented) not only won a competition against other car types in its performance while driving uphill, but also became the first car ever to reach a speed of 100 kilometres per hour.

Electric cars didn’t become ubiquitous straight away because of the lack of charging infrastructure; but when a growing number of private houses got connected to the electric grid in the 1910s, its heyday seemed to have arrived. Unfortunately, the lack of good performance over longer distances, the amount of time required for charging, and the invention of the self-starter for internal-combustion engine cars put a stop to its rise to fame.

The temporary setback didn’t keep inventors from pondering on the potential of electricity-driven motorized vehicles. A remarkable venture was that of French industrial designerPaul Arzens. Gaining international recognition with his locomotives for the French national railways, Arzens' early career was devoted to car design and engineering.

One of Arzens’ masterpieces was the egg-shaped electric car nicknamed ‘l’Oeuff’. Developed during World War II, the plexiglas-topped vehicle was equipped with heavy batteries, allowing it to drive a distance of 100 kilometres at a speed of 70km/h.

While temporarily gaining traction in wartime, when fuel was scarce, in later decades electric cars mainly remained in use as small, professional vehicles - such as bakery or dairy vans.

The history of the electric car isn’t completely void of postwar triumphs, though. In 1971 theMoon buggy, or first manned vehicle to drive on the lunar surface, operated on electricity.

Yet it would not be before the end of the century with its oil crises and growing concerns over environmental issues that the interest in electric cars would mount again and lead to revolutionary new developments.

By the time the first electric roadster developed by Tesla Motors took to the highway, the new millennium had arrived. In its wake followed a plethora of all-electric and hybrid models that from the 2010s onwards carved a substantial part out of the market.

Better performance, more daring designs, increased environmental concerns and an expansion of charging infrastructures have made electric cars more appealing to car enthusiasts and pragmatic shoppers alike. The next decades will demonstrate whether or not their rise to glory will finally result in victory.

Today, we make a distinction between books for pleasure and books for study. Modern scholars read differently than someone reading as a leisure activity. In the Middle Ages, there was a similar distinction between the reading habits of scholars and of the reading public. We can tell the kind of audience a manuscript was destined for by its design and we can tell how it was used by the images and words inscribed on the parchment.

There are two main ‘categories’ of manuscript based on the form it inherits from its readership: there are thelivre-objet(book as object) and thelivre-outil(book as tool).

Typically thelivre-objetis best exemplified by manuscripts created for the nobility or bourgeoisie to be used for entertainment or private devotional purposes. Such manuscripts tend to be luxuriously decorated with miniatures, stylised initials (letters marking a new section/paragraph), and richly illuminated margins.

The above image from aBook of Hoursis sumptuously decorated. More space is dedicated to the principal and marginal illumination than to text. Almost no marginal space has been left blank for note-taking since that was not typically how readers interacted with this kind of book. Consequently, this particular illumination depicts Mary reading what looks remarkably like a typical Book of Hours, which further indicates the manner in which this particular kind of luxurious devotional object would have been read.

In addition to Books of Hours and romances, we also find luxury copies of scientific works in royal collections. Similarly to Books of Hours, these scientific works tend to be written in a nice, clean script with a clear and spaciousmise-en-pagefor ease of reading. They feature decorated initials as well as relatively frequent and prominent representational images (all of which may be seen in the image below).

Unlike thelivre-objet, manuscripts destined for students, ‘gens de savoir’ (men of knowledge), and theologians for scholarly use (livre-outil) tend not to be decorated. Instead of stylised initials and marginal illuminations, we see interlinear glosses and marginal notes in these kinds of manuscripts.

The pages of these manuscripts tend to be densely filled with text, with marginal space filled by notes (as seen below) and diagrams (as seen above in the top margin of the page, and below in the bottom margin of the page). Readers would draw diagrams corresponding to the text to help  visualise and comprehend the complex content of the reading material. Readers would also draw attention to important points by quite literallypointingto it with the image of a hand (these are calledmanicula), an example of which can be seen above in the centre of the left-hand margin.

The above manuscript contains content similar to theImage du monde. But the form of the manuscript is markedly different, revealing how it was certainly used as a tool for scholarly study by how the reader engaged in thinking* with* the text directly on the page.

Marginal note-taking as a key aspect of scholarly reading did not cease in the late Middle Ages with early printed books. Rather, scholarly readers continued to use their books as tools whether printed or manuscript.

The above example of an early printed book displays marginal notes made by the reader studying the text. As with manuscripts, such marginal notations differentiate an early printed book used as a tool (outil) for study from an early printed book used as an object (objet) of leisurely reading.

As can be seen in the examples here, how a reader engaged in reading a text in the Middle Ages determined the physical form a manuscript or early printed book would take, which may now be used to identify the readership group likely associated with a given manuscript.

What was the Venice ghetto?

What was the role of ghettos in World War II?

Where did the word ghetto come from? What was life like in a ghetto?

Hearing the word ‘ghetto’, most people will think of a poor urban neighbourhood inhabited by a single minority group.

The term ghetto is actually several centuries old, referring to a specific area of Venice in which Jews in the city were forced to live from the 16th century onwards. Although the etymological origins of the word are cloaked in mystery, the term soon came to signify neighbourhoods where Jewish people were housed involuntarily.

Prior to Jewish emancipation in the late 18th and 19th centuries, Jewish ghettos were found throughout Europe.

In some cases, Jews were required to live in these designated areas whereas in others it was simply a matter of choice.

Often ghettos would have defined gates to demarcate the area.

These neighbourhoods were often over-populated as expanding the ghetto was not allowed. For that same reason, many ghettos had high tenement-style apartment buildings.

Even after emancipation, when Jews were no longer forced to live in neighbourhoods allocated to their community, the term ‘ghetto’ persisted as a pejorative reference to predominantly Jewish areas. For example, the Lower East Side in Manhattan was called the New York Ghetto.

During World War II, Jews were once again forced to live in ghettos in Europe.

The majority of the community either perished due to malnutrition and disease or after being deported to concentration camps.

The photograph below shows a street in the Podzamcze ghetto in Poland, where 30,000 Jews lived in exile before their deportation in 1941. In the foreground, you can see the white armbands the Jewish ghetto inhabitants wore that identified them as Jewish.

The most notorious ghetto in World War II was built in Warsaw, established in 1940 and liquidated in 1943.

It is estimated that almost 100,000 people were killed in theWarsaw Ghettowhereas another 300,000 residents died in the concentration camps.

Slowly, the term ghetto has shifted in its association away from Jews and has become more indicative of poor city quarters.

In the United States, the term ghetto often refers to a predominantly urban area with a mostly African American community. In fact, African Americans have used this term since the early 20th century to refer to the segregated neighbourhoods in which they live.

Elvis Presley famously popularised the songIn the Ghetto, originally composed by Mac Davis, to decry the plight of those living in the Chicago ghetto during the 1960s.

On the other hand, in Montreal, Canada, the neighbourhood next to McGill University is referred to as the student ghetto and here, the term carries no negative connotation.

It goes to show that, by the end of the20th century, the word had entered into the dictionary of popular culture aesthetics. In the 1980s and 1990s, a ghetto-blaster became a common synonym for aboombox.

Similarly, the expressionghetto fabuloushas come to be used to point out a specific lifestyle, the aesthetic concepts and materialist culture associated with it. Hip-hop icons such as Sean Combs, Jay-z, and Kimora Lee Simons have even designed fashion labels around the concept.

This is certainly a far cry from the 16th-century Venetian neighbourhood where the roots of the ghetto lie.

The first TV broadcasts

Colour TVs and more channels

TV in the palm of our hands

Have you ever lived without a television? Nowadays, it seems almost self-evident that we would have a TV in our homes, or at least access to a high definition screen that allows us to watch all the videos, movies and TV series that we want, whenever and wherever. This blog explores how people have watched TV from the 20th century to today: from collective living room entertainment to more personal experiences on a small screen in the palm of your hand.

The digitalisation of our society has led to a significant change in how we consume audiovisual content. “Watching television” can have many different meanings these days, and mean different things to different people. For some people, it means watching a talk show on a big screen with the whole family in the living room. For others it might describe watching their favourite TV series in one go, by themselves, on a laptop or smartphone.

Although the television had been invented earlier, the first experiments with TV broadcasting started to emerge in the late 1920s and early 1930s. The following clip, for instance, shows the first broadcasting tests from a television studio in New York in 1937:

For quite some years, though, the concept of broadcasting remained novel to many people. The following clip shows how the concepts of television and broadcasting were explained to cinemagoers during a French news programme in 1951. Presenter Jacqueline Joubert takes a moment to describe how a TV programme is filmed and how moving pictures are transmitted from the film studios to the screens in people’s homes:

All major events in the world could now be captured audiovisually and broadcast to people’s TV sets. Around this time television started to replace radio as the dominant medium in people’s daily lives. This led to a new style of home entertainment. Families and friends would gather in front of the little square box in someone’s living room, and enjoy an hour of television together.

In the early days of broadcasting, “watching TV” simply meant tuning into the daily or weekly show that was aired on a specific day and hour of the week, on the one available channel. Over the years, however, the world of television would see many changes. During the 1960s and 1970s, broadcasters upgraded their black-and-white transmissions to colour. The following clip shows a Dutch report from 1966 in which colour television was introduced and demonstrated by NTS (Dutch Television Foundation) for the first time in a “colour TV studio”:

More channels and TV shows slowly began to emerge. People could now choose from a variety of different TV programmes that aired on different broadcasting channels and different times during the day. Due to the rise of VHS tapes in the 1980s, it became possible to record a specific programme from your television onto a tape, allowing you to watch your favourite TV show at a time of your choosing.

The early 21st century saw another important technological revolution in the world of television: the end of analogue viewing and the rise of digital television.

The digital revolution and the commercialisation of the internet massively changed how we watch television. The digitalisation of TV allowed people to watch hundreds of channels from all over the world, offered on-demand and in ever higher quality. Moreover, the rise of laptops, smartphones and tablets allows people to watch their favourite programmes on many other devices besides just their TV set. Besides gathering together with friends and family in front of the big screen, people now carry around their own private TVs wherever they are.

With the development of video and streaming platforms such as Youtube, Netflix and Amazon Prime, people seem to be focused on their personal little screens more than ever before. Terms like “binge watching” have entered our language, indicating how people’s TV watching patterns have drastically changed with time. The act of “watching TV” does not only reflect a collective, scheduled moment of home entertainment anymore. Now it includes watching all 24 episodes of that newest Netflix series in one go, or watching your all time favourite film whilst travelling by train.

Watching television has become a much more private experience that can be enjoyed completely by yourself, wherever you want, whenever you want. Watching movies and TV on the screen of your smartphone would have been unthinkable during the early days of television… or would it?

Kreolitude and what it can bring to people

Every year since 1986, 28  October is ‘Jounen Kréyol toutwon Latè’ (International day of créole). First initiated on the island of Dominica the celebrations last between one week in places like Saint Lucia, Dominica and Guyana to a whole month in places such as Guadeloupe and Montréal.

The term ‘Kreolitude’ makes reference to ‘Négritude’ the French literary and political movement of the 1930s, 40s and 50s, which was linked to anti-colonialism and slavery. -
Following this literary movement, ‘La Kreolitude’ is an artistic and cultural commitment to define Creole culture in all its components.

The complexity of origins leads to a blended identity that does not allow an individual to get lost in the myth of returning to ancestral origins. But leads to an individual 'reconstruction' in a new culture, rich in its differences. This implies a sense of creativity and inventiveness in order to make these differences a collective work, in a process of creation and going well beyond a multicultural society.

If Creole is defined as a feeling, that of being Creole, Kreolitude would be defined as an action, that ofunderstanding the Creole factand of letting people know what it can bring to other peoples.

From the launch in 2018, artists and cultural professionals, as creators and mediators, were made aware of the promotion of the heritage of Creole cultures to their audiences.

Very symbolically, ‘Creole Cultures’ will be presented to UNESCO as a candidate for inclusion on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. The achievements of Creole artists testifying to Creole culture have already spread around the world. Some have been presented to UNESCO for registration and have been accepted.

Currently, the OCÉANA project is being prepared. This aims to develop access for all to resources, such as an interactive digital encyclopedia of the intangible cultural heritage (ICH) of the Indian Ocean and the coastal territories of South Africa.Access will be provided for creators, as well as students, the Creole diaspora or simply the public citoyens.es, open and curious about the cultures of the world, in order to generate new works resulting from these researches.

In order to bring together all the curious and creative people, working groups have been launched. Groups that you, readers, are invited to join."Creole cultures / Kiltir Kreol / Cultures créoles" on these websites:

Pedro Sunda, a Servant of Dom Miguel de Castro

Diego Bemba, a Servant of Dom Miguel de Castro

Dom Miguel de Castro, Emissary of Kongo

Three portraits telling a remarkable story of diplomacy and colonial history in the 17th century

What can we learn from studying some of the rare portraits of people of colour in European art museums? Three paintings in the collection ofSMK – Statens Museum for Kunst(the National Gallery of Denmark) tell a remarkable story of diplomatic relations in the 17th century while also pertaining to larger structures of European colonial history.

These portraits of a Congolese emissary and his servants have been part of the collection since 1654. The artist has neither signed nor dated the artworks so hence the museum exhibits them as created by an 'Unknown Dutch artist'.

The Congolese man is dressed according to European fashion around the 1640s and 50s. He wears a green velvet suit with golden ribbons and buttons and a large white collar like the ones sported by the Spanish king at the time, only without lace edges.

His body is turned slightly to the right while he gazes to the rear, as if somebody or something demands his attention. With his right arm, he supports a large and heavy elephant tusk and with a firm grip holds the pointed end upwards with the other hand. A soft light comes from a high window outside the picture space. The shadows cast from the window edge and from his own head frames his dark face on a light brown background.

Although it is only a half figure portrait, the artist has created a dynamic and vivid composition thanks to the juxtaposed movement of the sitter's body, the direction of his eyes, the shadow to the left and the bended diagonal of the elephant tusk. This vividness is combined with a severe palette consisting of a beautiful combination of green, brown and whitish hues. An inscription on the reverse of the painting identifies the man as Pedro Sunda, which tells us that he was a baptised Christian.

The inscription on the reverse of the pendant piece reads Diego Bemba. Diego wears the same type of clothes as his companion and is placed in the same framing of shadows. His body too is turned slightly to the right and he carries a small artisanal box which he points at with his index finger. His eyes are turned upwards as if he were addressing or giving thanks to God. This gesture makes it plausible that the box contains something holy, a saint's relic or obols.

The name of Dom Miguel de Castro reads on the reverse of a third painting in the series. A blue cloudy sky over a small brim of open sea forms the background. Dom Miguel turns slightly to the right, just as the two other men. He gazes out at the beholder with a serious expression. He is dressed in a brown woollen riding coat with hanging sleeves over a silver brocade suit. The top of the silver handle of a sword, carried in a fancy decorated cross belt, peeps over the lower edge of the painting. The wide brimmed hat with a red ostrich feather was also fashionable in Europe in the 1640s and 50s. A remarkable feature is that two gold counters are stuck in the hat's silver ribbon.

Archival sources mention that Dom Miguel was head of a diplomatic delegation whose mission it was to gather European support in a conflict in their homeland, then named Kongo, in Africa. The delegation travelled both to Dutch Brazil and to the Dutch republic in order to negotiate support from the Dutch West Indian Company (WIC) which was in charge of colonial matters related to Africa.

Dom Miguel was ambassador for the count of Sonho (Soyo), Daniel da Silva, the other part in the conflict being King Garcia II. In 1642-43, both sides sent diplomatic missions to negotiate with the WIC. The Dutch had just won Luanda in Angola, and therefore they were interested in maintaining good relations with leaders in other West African regions.

Like other European countries, the Dutch republic took part in the colonial trade that implied import of enslaved Africans to the colonies overseas. The African leaders sold war prisoners, victims of territorial conflicts in their homelands, to the Europeans who shipped them to the Americas as enslaved people. For the Europeans, they were indispensable manpower in the sugar plantations in the South American and Caribbean colonies.

In 1636, the WIC had appointed count Johan Maurits of Nassau-Siegen as governor in Dutch Brazil where he served until 1643. Diplomacy and trade bonds between Africa and Dutch Brazil became strong during this period.

In 1643, Johan Maurits received Dom Miguel and his companions Dom Bastião Manduba, Dom Antônio Fernandes and three servants at his residence in Recife.

Perhaps these portraits were painted in Recife during their stay there. As a patron of art and natural science, Johan Maurits had invited a small group of Dutch painters to join him in the colonies to document the new worlds' people, customs and nature. Frans Post, Abraham Willaerts and Albert Eckhout were among the artists that followed Johan Mauritz.

Later that year, Johan Maurits traveled back to his residence in The Hague, now a museum, theMauritshuis, where his collection was installed. In 1654, he presented the three paintings of Dom Miguel and his servants to the Danish King Frederick III who installed them in the Indian Chamber in the Royal Kunstkammer in Copenhagen along with other paintings and artefacts from the 'New World'.

In 1824, the Royal Kunstkammer was dispersed, and with the Constitutional Act of the Kingdom of Denmark in 1849, all collections became state property. In 1897, Statens Museum for Kunst opened to the public in a new building with the collections of paintings and sculpture. The three portraits were not part of the display because they were on deposit in different places. From 1933 to 2011, they were on long term deposit in the Danish National Museum as part of an ethnographical display. From 2011 until today, the portraits form part of SMK's display of paintings from the Dutch Golden Age where one room is dedicated to Dutch colonial history.

Today, the three portraits often travel to international exhibitions as interest in colonial history has increased over the last decades. Right now, you can see the portrait of Dom Miguel in the exhibition'Afro-Atlantic Histories'in the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, until January 23 and in theNational Gallery of Art, Washington, from April 10 to July 17, 2022.

How mixed raced people have contributed to the stories of Europe

The story of the presence of people of colour in European history cannot be complete without the acknowledgment of mixed-race peoples. It is not enough to simply drop people of mixed race into a race group that suits the telling of European history and if acknowledged would complicate the claim for cultural purity.

People of mixed race have contributed to the stories of Europe in profound and important ways that attest to the struggle to find a place of acceptance in European life. These contributions are complicated by the lack of an identifiable understanding of what mixed race means in the course of that history.

It is first not the story of America where ‘a drop of black blood’ meant that person was identified as black and as such was denied rights. The basis of this identification clearly placed one in a particular social and legal category and this meant ironically one’s identification was not predicated on an individual understanding of what that person understood it to be, but an identity socially and legally constructed by those in power to do so.

This is of course harmful. Identity was often based on what was perceived to be the inferior racial group by western views. It is only recently that people of mixed race have begun to accept the reality of their being of more than one racial group and to advocate for a more nuanced discussion about race overall that includes their own reality.

To look at some of the contributions of mixed-race people to the narrative of European history, we might consider a few important examples of people who made this narrative distinct.

The 18th century composer, known as theChevalier de Saint-Georges, whose actual name was Joseph Boulogne was born of a white plantation owner and an enslaved mother. He was an actual court composer in the court of Louis 16th and Marie Antoinette. He was an accomplished musician, composer, polymath and officer in the French army. Interestingly, he was born before Mozart and although much of his musical compositions were lost, the influence he had on the music Mozart composed much later is difficult to deny. He was widely known in the world, even in America. Thus, the representation in the classical age of music is not complete without acknowledging his presence in that story.

Late 19th century people of mixed race also contributed to the arts as for example,Samuel Coleridge-Taylorwho was a noted composer and conductor from England.

Important literary writers such asAlexander PushkinandAlexander Dumasmade contributions to the Romantic period of the 19th century and although they are well known as writers; it surprises many readers to know they were of mixed race.

Literary characters of mixed race make appearances in the narratives of the Middle Ages including such figures asSir Morien, a knight in King Arthur’s court,Othello,The MoorandFeirefizin Eschenbach’s,Parzival.

Other figures from the Renaissance period, for example, includeAlessandro de’ Medici, the first duke of the Florentine republic who is said to have been born to a servant of African descent and the ruler of Florence Lorenzo II de’Medici.

In the 18th century, Peruvian priestFather Martin de Porreswas the son of a Spanish nobleman and a formerly enslaved woman of African and Indigienous descent and was considered the patron saint of mixed-race people. These examples tell a much more complex story of European social and cultural history.

In the end, there is much to do by scholars to contribute to a more complete understanding of the rich contributions made to European history by people of colour, but also an acknowledgement to the complexity of this conversation when it comes to race overall, and in particular people of mixed race. Slowly, there are more voices pushing for an honest and open consideration about mixed race as an identity.

People such as writer James McBride, in his book, The Color of Water, former American president Barack Obama, and Meghan Markel, to name a few are leading voices in advocating for these important conversations about race and mixed-race identities.

It is these conversations that will mean a reconsideration of European history, one that will be closer to the reality of the presence of mixed race people and their contributions to that history. It is an exciting time to have this conversation as we move deeper into the 21st century, a century where the presence of mixed-race peoples will be a significant demographic; one that can no longer be denied.

Legacy

Fencer, composer, soldier, Versailles

Joseph Bologne - known as the Chevalier de Saint-Georges - was an 18th century classical composer and conductor and champion fencer. His mixed race heritage - son of a white father and Black mother - shaped his life in in Parisienne and French society in the 1700s.

Born in 1745 in Guadelope, Joseph Bologne was the son of Anne (known as Nanon), an enslaved woman of Senegalese origin, and Georges de Bologne Saint-Georges, who was Nanon's enslaver. Despite Nanon being the enslaved servant to his wife Elisabeth, Georges de Bologne acknowledged being the young Joseph's father and gave him his surname, part of which - 'de Saint-Georges' - was named after his plantations in Guadeloupe.

In 1753, Georges took Joseph - then aged 7 - to France to be educated. Joseph was sent to a boarding school, while his father returned to Guadeloupe. Two years later, Georges and Nanon came to France, and moved to an apartment in Paris's Saint Germain neighbourhood.

Up to this point, in French society, Georges Bologne had been a commoner. In 1757, this changed when he was given the title Gentilhomme ordinaire de la chambre du roi (Gentleman of the King's Chambe

Joseph benefitted greatly from his father's position in society. However, due to Les Codes Noirs - racist laws in France which restricted the lives of people of colour from the 17th century - young Joseph was not eligible to inherit his father's titles, because of his mixed race heritage and his parents not being married.

All of these contexts contributed to the three careers and pursuits that Joseph simultaneously followed through his adult life: fencing athlete, the military and music composer.

From age 13, Joseph attended the Académie royale polytechnique des armes et de l'équitation, where he learned fencing and horsemanship.

He progressed well, and within a few years, had become a champion fencer and accomplished horseman. His arms were described as being faster than lightning. Joseph fought many duels and matches in France, as well as in England.

His sporting exploits - as well as being a charismatic and handsome man - made him famous, and he becomes a darling of Parisian society.

When he graduated in 1766, Joseph was made aGendarme du roi(Officer of the King's bodyguard) and a chevalier, a member of orders of knighthood. From then on, Joseph would be known as the 'Chevalier de Saint-Georges'.

The French Revolution began in 1789, and deeply affected Joseph's later life. He decided to enlist in the Revolutionary Army, fighting for liberty and equality.

In September 1792, a cavalry of volunteers from the West Indies and Africa was founded, with Joseph serving as a colonel. It was called theLégion nationale des Américains & du midibut was often later referred to as theLégion Saint-Georgesdue to Joseph's outstanding performance. It was the first all-Black army regiment in Europe.

One of the officers under his command was named Thomas-Alexandre Dumas, future general-in-chief in the French army and father of the author of the Three Musketeers.

However, this career was often beset by accusations by others. Soon after being appointed colonel, he had to defend his role from accusations that he used military money to pay personal debts (most of which were based on rumours). An inquiry cleared Joseph of all charges.

Later, during the Terror - when French revolutionaries turn on their own forces, suspecting them of royalist sympathies - Joseph was dismissed and imprisoned for 18 months. He was also condemned by critics for being involved in non-revolutionary activities such as music.

Following this, he returned to Guadelope and attempted to regain his military rank and regiment. He eventually was re-appointed colonel of the regiment, but there were already two other colonels in the regiment. Eventually, Joseph's military career ended in 1795.

In 1769, the Parisian public was amazed to see Joseph - known as a great fencer and athlete - playing violin in Le Concert des Amateurs, Gossec's orchestra with 70 members. Four years later, Joseph became its conductor. It was ultimately disbanded in 1781 due to a lack of funding.

Over his long musical career, Joseph wrote many symphonies, sonatas, concertos, opera and string quartets.

In 1776, Joseph was proposed as the next director of the Paris Opéra, which was struggling financially and artistically. However, three of the leading ladies presented a petition to Queen Marie Antoinette saying that they would not be able to take orders from a mixed race person. Marie Antoinette had been known to attend some of Joseph's concerts, and to keep the affair from embarrassing the queen, he withdrew his name from consideration.

One year later, his first operaErnestinepremiered at the Comédie Italien. However, critical reception is not kind, and it closed after the premiere.

Following this, Marie-Antoinette preferred to experience music in less public settings. In her salon in Versailles, she limited the audience to her intimate circle and a few musicians. The Chevalier de Saint-Georges was invited to play music with the Queen, with he most likely paying the violin while she played the forte-piano.

On June 10, 1799, Saint-Georges died of bladder disease. Over the two centuries since he lived, memory of the Chevalier de Saint-Georges faded. Many of his musical compositions were lost to history as a result of the French Revolution, though a large body of work can still be enjoyed now.

Today, Joseph Bologne, the Chevalier de Saint-Georges, is best remembered as one of the earliest classical composer of mixed race and African ancestry, as well as a ground-breaking military leader.

Cuban whose art was influenced both by Catholic and African traditions

Wifredo Lam, born December 8, 1902, was the son of a Cuban, Chinese immigrant father, and a Congolese formerly enslaved mother. Growing up in the sugar farming village of Sagua la Grande in Cuba, his early art was influenced both by Catholic as well as African traditions and imbued with spiritual practices that he learned from his godmother, Matonica Wilson, a Santería priestess and locally-celebrated healer and sorceress.

Over the years he was to travel far, and, at each junction, his Afro-Cuban fusion remained the undertone of his evolving artistic practice.

Lam went on to study in Madrid where he was influenced by Salvidor Dalì. He travelled around the Spanish countryside and closely identified with Spanish peasants, whose troubles reminded him of the former enslaved people he grew up around in Cuba. During the Spanish Civil War, he turned to producing Republican propaganda posters and was eventually drafted to defend Madrid.

In 1938, he moved to Paris, and it was there he met Picasso, who introduced him to many of the leading artists of the time. In a fascinating study, Michele Greet describes how prominent members of the Parisian avant-garde developed a fascination with Lam, not only with his work, but more specifically with how they perceived race to have shaped his art.

Two people in particular took an avid interest in Lam - Picasso and André Breton -each mythologising him in order to validate their own perceptions of non-western cultures. In his trip to Mexico in the same year, Lam stayed with Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, and through their influences further broadened his artistic practice.

In 1940 he collaborated with the Romanian artist Victor Brauner to createMarianne. According to Dr. Adina Kamien, Senior Curator of Modern Art at The Israel Museum, Jerusalem, the collage's dark tones illustrated the accumulation of gunpowder by the Maquis, the French guerilla resistance fighters of World War II.

Marianneis currently on display at the Israel Museum in the exhibitionPicasso to Kentridge: Modern Masterpieces on Paperand described by Kamien:

Victor Brauner and Wilfredo Lam actively explored the realm of dreams and the unconscious, and thrived on the occult and the mystical. The content and style of Brauner's art reflects a fertile fusion of wide-ranging world cultures, mythologies, and religious beliefs from Egyptian to Aztec, Native American to Oceanic, and Jewish to Hindu.Marianneis a collaborative work, created while Lam and Brauner took refuge in the South of France from the Nazi invasion. The work is prophetic in its content, as it deals with a French resistance a year before it was initiated.

Many artists were to influence Lam over the years, but, on his return to Havana in 1941, he developed a new awareness of Afro-Cuban traditions and a concern for the oppressed enslaved and the Afro-Cuban culture who he felt had been degraded and their culture prettified for the sake of tourism. Lamenting Cuba's African lost heritage in an interview with Max-Pol Fouchet, he said:

I wanted with all my heart to paint the drama of my country, but by thoroughly expressing the negro spirit, the beauty of the plastic art of the blacks. In this way, I could act as a Trojan horse that would spew forth hallucinating figures with the power to surprise, to disturb the dreams of the exploiters.

He settled in Havana in 1941 where he turned to paint the drama of his country in his unique style, now matured in a fusion of human, animal, and vegetable elements into his unique hybrid figures.

Vivid examples of this period can be found in the works from the Israel Museum collection including a gouache on paper,Horse Woman(c.1942), and his oil on canvasComposition (Composizione)(1967). Perhaps his most iconic work isThe Jungle, painted in 1943, and purchased by the Museum of Modern Art in New York. It is often compared to Picasso'sGuernica.

*The exhibitionPicasso to Kentridge: Modern Masterpieceson Paper, which draws on the Israel Museum’s rich holdings, was on display in Jerusalem from July to December 2021.

Road to the Nobel Prize

A legacy for eternity

If you have read ourblog about Werner Heisenberg, you have already met one important German natural scientist and Nobel Prize laureate. Today, we introduce another one: Otto Hahn, the so-called father of nuclear chemistry and godfather of nuclear fission. Let’s look into Hahn’s professional biography and lifetime achievements.

Otto Hahn (8 March 1879 – 28 July 1968) was a German scientist and a pioneer in radiochemistry. Hahn studied chemistry in Marburg and Munich and received his doctorate in 1901.

After one year of military service, he returned to the University of Marburg in order to work as an assistant for his former doctoral supervisor, Theodor Zincke. From 1904 to 1906 Hahn pursued his research in the field of radiochemistry in various cities, including London, Montreal and Berlin. During that time Hahn discovered a new radioactive chemical element: “Radiothorium”. In 1912 he was appointed director at the newly founded Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry in Berlin-Dahlem.

Together with his research partner Lise Meitner, he discovered element 91, which was the key to clarifying the decay phenomena of radioactive elements. Hahn, Meitner and Otto Robert Frisch conducted an experiment together that both recognized nuclear fission as such and explained it theoretically.

Their discovery was later used for the production of nuclear weapons, which Hahn had never intended and which would lead to him protesting against nuclear weaponry for the rest of his life. During  World War II, Otto Hahn’s work focused on the isolation and identification of new unknown types of atoms, produced as radioactive “fission products” during uranium nuclear fission.

Hahn was awarded theNobel Prize in Chemistryfor his 1944 discovery of the fission of heavy nuclei. Since the committee decided “that none of the year's nominations met the criteria as outlined in the will of Alfred Nobel”, he received his prize one year later.

After World War II, Hahn became one of the most respected scientists in Europe. This was due to his political engagement against nuclear weapons, especially after catastrophes in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. In 1948 he became the founding president of the "Max Planck Society for the Advancement of Science", the successor organization to the "Kaiser Wilhelm Institute". Hahn took a political position that advocated the peaceful use of nuclear energy.

Just like Heisenberg, Hahn opposed the military use of nuclear energy and stood against the planned nuclear armament by signing the Göttingen Manifesto in 1957. Because of his active pacifism from 1957 onwards, he was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize several times and received the Order “Pour le Mérite”, more precisely the “Great Federal Cross of Merit with Star and Shoulder Ribbon”.

Hahn was invited to the Lindau Nobel Meeting regularly, where he spoke about nuclear fission and sometimes even about work that did not go exactly as planned. Even if you're not a scientist, the following lecture is an interesting and entertaining example of his talks at Lindau.

Otto Hahn’s private legacy is owned and curated by the Ernst Max von Grunelius-Society located in his city of birth, Frankfurt (Main). His scientific legacy is owned and curated by the Archive of the Max Planck Society in Berlin-Dahlem.

From home project to national icon

Masters of craft

Heroes forever

Between dream and memory

For many children living in the times of the Polish People's Republic and throughout the 1990s, the end of the day was marked by the broadcast of bedtime stories: a short block of cartoons and animated series shown on channel 1 of the Polish public broadcaster TVP. Every day at 7PM sharp, streets were deserted as children sat in front of their TV screen. The animated bedtime stories closed their day, while the next program - the 7:30 p.m news report - opened up the final stretch of the evening for their parents.

Bedtime stories are a unique TV format that gained popularity in the countries of the socialist bloc, often being the only television offering aimed at children. Many of these animations,  shown on television as well as in cinemas, were produced at the Studio of Small Film Forms Se-Ma-For in Łódź.

The studio’s beginnings date back to 1947, when the first post-war puppet film,Under the Reign of King Krakus (Za króla Krakusa), directed by Zenon Wasilewski, was made in the director's private apartment.

Se-Ma-For soon became known in Poland as the cradle of animated films (mainly with puppets) for children, while for foreign viewers their calling card were the experimental films and animations shown in the festival circuit.

Se-Ma-For employed directors and producers with very diverse artistic visions. Animators Daniel Szczechura and Zbigniew Rybczyński were known for their experimentation on the form of animation, using cut-outs and puppets in their work. Roman Polański and Janusz Morgenstern became known for their feature-length films.  Edward Sturlis, Tadeusz Wilkosz, and Lucjan Dembiński focused on children's films and cartoons.

Outstanding Polish composers were invited to create music, including Krzysztof Penderecki and Krzysztof Komeda. You could hear jazz, symphonic and electroacoustic music not only in the films intended for cinema festivals, but also in those aimed at the youngest audience. King Midas, for instance: a film by Lucjan Dembiński with a score composed byPenderecki.

Years after these avant-garde musical cartoons aired, some of the songs remain in the collective memory of the Polish youth that grew up with Se-Ma-For movies. Not only older generations, but also children of the new millennium know  the lyrics and music of the theme song of„The Adventures of Teddy-Bear Drop Ear" ("Przygody Misia Uszatka")

For a bedtime - good evening/ Teddy bear is singing for you/ They call me Teddy Bear Drop Ear / 'cause I have a droopy ear

Equally accomplished visual artists, often experienced in working on theatre sets, took care of the decors  of Se-Ma-For’s productions. Scenographies for puppet films show an impressive amount of detail, a variety of textures, and ingenious technical solutions, often resulting from the lack of technologically more advanced techniques.

The most important assets of the Se-Ma-for animation studios, at least from the point of view of their young audience, were the heroes and their adventures. Se-Ma-for created a whole family of iconic animated figures - mainly animals - many of which are still recognized and loved today.

Teddy Bear Drop Ear, an always responsible teddy bear, was a style icon, always fashionably dressed. When he appeared in 1962 in a standalone film,  he did not have his characteristic attributes known from the later - serial - incarnation yet: the floppy left ear and pajamas in which he used to say goodbye to the viewers. He entered the collective memory for good in 1975, when Polish television began broadcasting an entire series of his adventures.

Also extremely popular were Teddy Bear Colargol (who was devoted to singing and dreamt of a career on stage)  and the cat duo Filemon and Bonifacy from the series"The Adventures of Filemon the Cat" ("Przygody kota Filemona").

Piotrek and the dog Pimpek from"Enchanted pencil" ("Zaczarowany ołówek"), in turn, made children dream of possessing  a magical pencil such as the one mentioned in the title, enabling them to create their own world and solve any problem they might encounter.

The extraordinary popularity of heroes whose adventures have been followed for years redirected the activities of Se-Ma-For , which steered away from  experimental cinema in the 1970s. Instead, meeting the requirements of television came to be the focal point.

After numerous changes in the company structure in the 1990s - difficult years for the Polish cinema industry - the studio ceased its activities  in 2018. The heroes it  created, however, remain alive, returning regularly to cinema and television screens. Now no longer a part of bedtime routines, the iconic animation series are broadcasted on thematic channels. Their heroes stay steady at the top of the rankings whenever polls inquire about the most popular characters of Polish children’s cinema.  and it can be assumed that they will not be dethroned for a long time.

Italian boxing champion in the 1920s

Born in Sanza Pombo in Belgian Congo (now in Angola), Leone Jacovacci was the son of an Italian engineer working for a Belgian company and a Congolese princess. At the young age of three, his father took him away to be raised in Italy by his grandparents.

Growing up, he faced a lot of racial prejudice, so, aged sixteen, he left Italy on a British Merchant ship. He headed to England, disguised as an Indian from Calcutta and worked as a cabin boy.

InLondon, having adopted a new name - John Douglas Walker - to make life easier, he enlisted in the British Army.

After being discharged, he took up boxing, becoming a professional boxer in 1919 under the name Jack Walker. That name was a homage to the American champion Jack Dempsey.

He was successful in England but, in 1921, after a defeat to Ronald Todd, he moved toFrancewhere he fought 21 times, with 14 wins and one draw.

In 1922, he returned toItalywhere he still pretended to be an American named Jack Walker -  he struggled to maintain this due to slip-ups in speaking fluent Italian.  He fought the Italian middleweight champion Bruno Frattini, but was defeated. He then returned to France and fought another 46 matches, with two in Switzerland and three in Argentina.

In 1925, he settled back in Italy. He then confessed that he was Italian, wanting his citizenship recognised.

This proved to be complicated due to Italy’s Nationalist Fascist Party.

Boxing and cycling were the most popular sports in Italy at the time. For the two years he was back in Italy, he had beaten every boxer he had faced until his match with national champion Mario Bosisio in October 1927.

Jacovacci won the match on points, but the verdict was reduced which meant that Bosisio kept his title.

In June 1928, in a rematch with Bosisio at the National Stadium in Rome, Jacovacci won points in 15 rounds and managed to win both National champion and European middleweight champion belts.

Proto-Fascist writer Gabriele D’Annuzio, Edna Mussolini (daughter of dictator Benito Mussolini) and government officials were in the audience for this match. His win angered the fascists and, though he tried to integrate himself through joining the National Fascist Party, he suffered from the regime’s ostracism who were displeased that an Afro-Italian was the national champion.

After beating Bosisio, Jacovacci suffered from a detached retina and lost his boxing titles. He took up wrestling for some years, trying to disguise his disability, moved back to France and would return occasionally to Italy on special boxing invitations.

During the Nazi invasion of France in 1940, he tried to leave the country by reclaiming his British identity but was unsuccessful. He remained trapped in France throughout World War II. His partner Berthe Salmon changed her surname to Roquet to avoid being identified as Jewish, giving birth to their daughter Nicole.

Once the Nazis were being pushed out of Italy in 1944, Jacovacci was able to re-inlist in the British Army. He returned to Italy after the war and worked for a period of time for the newly-formed United Nations and assisted refugees.

He later had minor acting parts in the Italian film industry, then worked as an apartment doorman and janitor to earn some money in his old age. On November 16, 1983, he died of heart disease in Milan.

His life’s story is told in an Italian documentary calledIl Pugile del Duce - The Duce’s Boxerin 2017 by Director Tony Saccucci.

The production process

Transmission and retention of content

Learn about how aiming for more efficient manuscript production led to repeated iconography

In the Middle Ages, manuscript circulation occurred in two ways : amongst artisans who created new manuscripts, which then circulated amongst the reading population. Several copies of a single text - which were created and shared within a specific social network - tend to depict the same scenes in illuminations (though often in different artistic styles). This phenomenon reveals a lot about reading culture and manuscript transmission in late medieval urban culture.

Differences in artistic style or handwriting from one manuscript to another (or even within a single manuscript, which is not uncommon without a change in the contents indicates that a  division of labour was implemented in the production process. In the later Middle Ages (from the 13th century onwards), the rapidly developing book market streamlined the process of manuscript production into an efficient, almost mechanical process.

A minimum of four different ‘types’ of labourers were involved: parchmenters (parcheminiers), scribes, artists or illuminators (enlumineurs), and finally booksellers (libraires) who organised and oversaw the whole process. 
Each labourer completed a different task in the process. Parchmenters supplied parchment, scribes copied written content, and illuminators added images to the text (miniatures,marginal illuminations).

From the 13th-15th centuries, the Paris book market was the most important place for manuscript production in Western Europe. We know the identities of some Parisian libraires from this time, as well as the identities of scribes and illuminators they worked with. Clues in manuscripts reveal that libraires parsed texts for rapid production and illuminators engaged in  ‘serial production’ of illuminations (as they, too, worked with multiple libraires), leading to the repetition of iconography and motifs from one work to another. Thus, it becomes clear that this repetition is due in part to a push for more efficient production.

However, the repetition of iconography is not only pragmatic. Two other important factors influenced the medieval tendency to repeat the same or similar images from one manuscript (or one text) to another.

Because physical books remained luxury objects which only literate elites (scholars, ecclesiastes, and aristocrats mostly) could afford to buy and keep, memorisation was an important aspect of reading in the middle ages. Thus, images served as a visual aid for memory, helping the reader to recall information in a specific passage either by looking directly at the image or by remembering the image itself. Images were meant to represent key motifs found in the text, rather than representing ‘reality’. Motifs were shared from one text to another, and thus from one image to another.

Additionally, this repetition is symptomatic of a closed literary circle in which a given text or manuscript circulates. For example, in the multiple editions of theLivre des propriétés des chosesby Barthélemy l’Anglais translated into French by Jean Corbechon for Charles V, we see the same iconography used in the drawings introducing new sections.

In these two versions, the different artists have both depicted Genesis in four blocks, with the same creation scenes represented in both versions. The same phenomenon occurs with every miniature marking the beginning of a new section - for example, the physician is always depicted holding up a flask of urine (below).

Repetition like this in books that we know circulated in a specific, closed social milieu reveals a certain expectation of iconography. People expected to see a physician depicted a certain way. When a work circulates in a group with such shared expectations, these expectations are then reflected in the product. As such, artists sought  to represent figures that would be easily recognisable to readers.

Reading in the Middle Ages was a social activity in more ways than one (reading out loud, sharing books in a closed group). As such, how books were created and produced indicates how they were being shared and read, and the influence of collective social expectations on the process.

This blog is part of theArt of Reading in the Middle Agesproject which explores how medieval reading culture evolved and became a fundamental aspect of European culture.

African-American actor and abolitionist

Ira Aldridge was an African-American actor, playwright and theatre manager who achieved fame across Europe in the 19th century. Famed for his Shakespearean roles, he became an English citizen in 1863.

Ira Aldridge was born in New York City in 1807, to Reverend Daniel and Lurona Aldridge. He was educated at the African Free School, where he learned English grammar, writing, mathematics, geography and astronomy.

He made his acting debut in his teenage years, in the early 1820s, with the African Company, a theatre group which built the African Grove Theatre, the first resident African-American theatre in the United States.

Due to the persistent racism and prejudice faced by Black actors in the United States, Aldridge emigrated to Liverpool, England in 1824 as the valet for British-American actor James William Wallack. Thereafter, he made his career in England and across Europe.

Aldridge eventually moved to Glasgow, Scotland and studied at the University of Glasgow.

Aldridge first appeared on stage in London in 1825, aged just 17 - first in a low-profile production of Othello in May and later in October, inThe Revolt of Surinam, or A Slave's Revengeby Thomas Southerne.

At the time, a common theatre tradition was for actors to take the name or surname of other, more popular actors. Thus Ira Aldridge was known for a time as F. W. Keene Aldridge, taking the name Keene from the very popular British actor, Edmund Kean.

Aldridge's career through the 1820s progressed well. He soon was receiving top billing in plays, including the title role of Othello. He also played in other Shakespearean plays, such as King Lear, Macbeth and The Merchant of Venice.

From the late 1820s and through the 1830s, Aldridge's acting career took him beyond London. In 1828, he toured throughout England with a tour of Ireland following in 1831.

In 1852, Aldridge began a tour of Europe in Brussels, Belgium. Throughout the 1850s and 1860s, his tours brought him to France, Serbia, Switzerland Poland, Prussia and Russia. He received many awards and accolades, including the Prussian Gold Medal for Arts and Sciences from King Frederick, the Golden Cross of Leopold from the Czar of Russia, and the Maltese Cross from Berne, Switzerland.

Throughout his career, Aldridge was known for speaking directly to audiences, particularly on closing nights, about a variety of social issues. In particular, he spoke often about the Abolition of slavery in the United States and beyond.

In 1825, Aldridge had married Margaret Gill, an English woman, in London. They were married for nearly 40 years until her death in 1864. In 1865, Aldridge married again to Swedish Amanda von Brandt. However, this marriage was short-lived, as Aldridge died in 1867, in Łódź, Poland, having completed a 70-city tour of France.

The road to the Nobel Prize

After Nobel: a lasting influence

Meet an icon of 20th-century science history

Whether you associate his name with a very famous American TV series about the basics of chemistry (among other things) or not, German scientist Werner Heisenberg is a famous figure on a global scale. But who was this man exactly? The simple answer would be: a pioneer in the field of quantum mechanics who was honoured with the highest scientific award – the Nobel Prize.

In this blog post, we’ll take you on a journey through Heisenberg’s outstanding achievements.

Werner Heisenberg (5 December 1901 – 1 February 1976) was a German theoretical physicist, who established quantum mechanics and made important contributions to nuclear science. Heisenberg studied physics at the University of Munich and received his doctorate in 1923 under Arnold Johannes Wilhelm Sommerfeld. In 1924, he started to work for German physicist Max Born and became his assistant in Göttingen. Later on, Heisenberg worked at the institute of Niels Bohr in Copenhagen (Denmark) – a crucially formative time for him.

In 1925, the scientific field of ‘theoretical quantum mechanics’ was founded by Heisenberg, Born and Pascual Jordan. During this time, Heisenberg formulated his “uncertainty principle”, which is one of the fundamental statements of quantum mechanics. Two years later, in 1927, he was appointed professor at the University of Leipzig as well as head of the Theoretical Physics Institute in Leipzig.

This made him a key figure of theoretical physics, namely nuclear physics. In 1932 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics "For the creation of quantum mechanics, the application of which has, inter alia, led to the discovery of the allotropic forms of hydrogen", which he received a year later. In 1933, he was in very good company: Paul Dirac and Erwin Schrödinger received their Nobel Prizes the same year.

When Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany, Heisenberg openly defended the research results of Albert Einstein and Lise Meitner. For this reason, he was met with opposition from the National Socialists, who aimed to keep critics of the regime out of physics research. Nevertheless, he was able to continue his scientific career: in 1942 he became the director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics and was appointed professor at the University of Berlin.

He acted as the director of the German uranium project up until 1945, which, among other things, was intended to make atomic energy usable for military purposes. This means that Heisenberg was actively involved in a project that aimed at building an atomic bomb. It was this time in his life that led him to deal intensively with the philosophical implications of quantum mechanics and contributed to his conviction that atomic energy should only be used for peaceful purposes.

Heisenberg became President of the German Research Council and the Academy of Sciences in Göttingen after WWII, one of the many prestigious titles to his name.

Heisenberg was also an appointed lecturer in several countries, such as England, Scotland and the USA. Later in life he applied himself to research into the “world formula”: the unified theory of matter that would encompass all the basic laws of nature.

Heisenberg is well known for his active commitment to a peaceful use of nuclear energy. In 1957 he signed the Göttingen “Declaration of the 18 Atomic Scientists“, which illustrated the dangers of atomic weapons and spoke out against equipping the Bundeswehr with them. Due to his engagement, he was awarded the “Great Federal Cross of Merit with Star and Shoulder Ribbon”.

Heisenberg repeatedly took part in the Lindau Nobel Meeting: an annual scientific conference that has been held in the town ofLindau(Lake Constance, Germany) since 1951. Until today its aim is to bring Nobel laureates and young scientists together to promote scientific exchange across generations, cultures and disciplines. Selected Lindau lectures by Heisenberg, such as this one from the 1971 meeting, can be found in Europeana.

Learn how GIF IT UP participants find inspiration and bring cultural heritage to life

Every year at Europeana we’re amazed by the quality and diversity of the entries submitted for GIF IT UP. But how do people find fascinating content and come up with creative ideas? What inspires them and what software do they use? Let’s go behind the scenes and join three former participants on their creative journeys.

Grand Prize Winner GIF IT UP 2020, Nisha Alberti (Edinburgh, Scotland)

‘I use websites like Europeana to find openly licensed images that work well as collages, and GIF IT UP really inspired me to try animating my collages. When making a GIF, I try to make the picture do something surprising or unexpected. I usually use Photoshop to work on the picture. First, I cut out the image that I want to animate. Then I edit the background of the image so I'm free to move the image in the foreground around without any blank spaces appearing behind it.

One tip I received that really improves how my GIFs look is to make sure that each action also creates a little reaction on the side. For example, if something is about to jump, let it crouch down slightly before lifting off. Or if someone stops moving, let their clothing continue moving slightly before settling.’

GIF IT UP 2020 entry, Damien Petermann (Lyon, France)

‘The hardest thing for me with GIF-making is finding a good idea. I spend a lot of time looking for inspiration on GLAM websites like Europeana, and I prefer public domain images and Open GLAM collections because they allow free reuse of digital content. For example, on Europeana, I always use the "Can I use this?" filter to make sure that the images I find are freely editable and reusable.

I especially like to work with simple images like medieval illuminations, posters and prints with strong lines. Sometimes I create GIFs from a single image, but I also like to combine elements from several images. I mostly use image editing software like Photoshop for the different steps (clipping, background filling, animation), but last year I tried out the online toolConstructand created my most finished GIF (the one about Death) with it. The editing work in the software can be very time consuming (often more than 10 hours!) because there is a constant back and forth between the conception (ideas) and the technical realisation. Sometimes what I had imagined doesn't work or I need to go and find another element to add.

Now, to be more efficient, I really try to write a precise scenario of the scene I want to create, by breaking down the actions and specifying the necessary elements for each frame. I find that this allows me to make progress and to limit the number of unsuccessful attempts! Finally, I test the animation several times to find the time interval that gives the most fluid visual result. I really like to animate still images that already represent an activity of movement (at a standstill), because I feel that these images are just waiting to be put in motion! This is the case of my GIF created from atourist poster for Brittany which shows a passing trainor the one about theangel and his trumpet(for GIF IT UP 2019).’

I created my ownGIPHY channelto present my GIF creations, as well as aTwitter account(and soon a website) to talk about 2D animation of public domain images. And I'm trying to motivate my friends to get involved too: last year my little sister also participated in GIF IT UP!

‘My name is Tiphaine Touzeil but my « artist » name is Pamela Chougne. I like to make GIFs with paintings, especially portraits and medieval illustrations. I mostly use Photoshop software to make the GIFs in which I animate paintings or illustrations.

I try to tell a little story through my GIFs; I particularly like it when a painting comes to life. I have the impression and also the ambition, in a certain way, to make art a little more alive and to allow, via the GIF, a larger public to discover works that are sometimes unknown or forgotten.’

Staged disaster photos

Fighting the flames

Adding drama to catastrophes

Amplifying preventive measures

More action is needed

Would any 21st century holiday be complete without an environmental catastrophe? Fueled by climate change, extreme fires ravaged hectares of forests in the summer of 2021. In countries of southern Europe but also in unexpected places such as Finland, many forests were destroyed. This blog explores how the media has reported on historical wildfires across Europe through a selection of visual material available on Europeana.

In the beginning of the 20th century, cameras were large and cumbersome. Press photographers used large glass plates and heavy tripods, making it a hazardous enterprise to shoot any dangerous environmental catastrophes.

This is why in those years there was little action photography and most of it was staged. For example, the images of the fire damaging the green area near Birling Gap, the famous Sussex beauty spot near Eastbourne in 1932 illustrate this practice. Despite the urgency of the situation requiring immediate action, we see people standing still to look at the flames turning the vegetation into ashes.

In July 1911, fire ravaged five hectares of the French countryside, the Fontainebleau forest lying southeast of Paris. The photographs of this disaster are extremely vivid and realistic, even for our 21st century eyes.

A number of different techniques were used to fight wildfires. These blazes start small and can expand exponentially in no time, sometimes requiring cross-border cooperation to control fires over vast areas of land.

Firefighters, members of the military and ordinary citizens on the ground worked together with great dedication. They used standpipes and branches, and wore asbestos suits (which were not known to be toxic in the early 20th century).

In the second half of the 20th century aerial firefighting started to be used because it had significant advantages over ground fire suppression methods. It was faster and gave access to places which were unreachable by ground. It also offered better observation of the fire situation.

To add drama to news coverage of wildfires, special soundtracks were created, reminiscent of Hitchcock thrillers. Most of these newsreels were shown in cinemas before the main feature.

In some ways, these clips were consumed as entertainment and they borrowed cinematic effects to play with the public’s emotions. Here you can see some examples from Greek and Dutch reporting on forest fires, using overly epic and dramatic soundtracks.

By the end of the 20th century, TV coverage of wildfires had adopted an informative tone with live reports from the scene, broadcast to large international audiences on satellite and cable television channels. Awareness about forest fires was raised on both national and international levels.

TV programmes also showcased new techniques developed to prevent wildfires. This clip focuses on the forest fire warning system called ‘Fire Watch’ set up by the Berlin-based company IQ-Wireless. This technology uses high resolution cameras that were originally developed for the observation of earth from space.

Today, experts like Andrew Scott argue that climate change is causing an increase in wildfires. They are concerned that global warming is changing fires’ internal dynamics, making them more dangerous for firefighters and the general population. To find solutions, Andrew Scott has stated, "We urgently need more research to help to understand how and why fires are changing—and how to deal with the new conditions. In the meantime, initiatives such as FireWise in the U.S. and FireSmart in Canada, which engage with communities to help educate and develop local community initiatives, provide information and experience about how to plan and keep safe in the event of a wildfire".

Dutch lessons for foreign workers

Catalan classes for Erasmus students

Adults learning Irish

Young people learning Polish

Learning a language, as challenging as it may be, helps people to connect with others, deepen connections to other cultures or perhaps, helps to advance a professional career.

In Europe, where different traditions and cultures co-exist next to each other, linguistic diversity is essential and so is the importance of learning new languages. For instance, though there are24 official languagesin the European Union, more than 200 languages are spoken across the continent.

This blog presents the multicultural and multilingual European landscape, with videos showing different learning and teaching techniques of languages captured in the archival footage fromEUscreen.

The free movement of workers means that nationals of any member state of the European Union can take up employment in another member state on the same conditions as the nationals of that particular member state.

This video shows how foreign workers residing in Rotterdam received Dutch lessons from volunteers in the 1970s.

What better way to learn a new language than to immerse yourself in the local culture?

This video from 2011 shows Erasmus exchange students learning Catalan with a different approach: with cooking lessons!

While Irish is the national language in the Republic of Ireland, many Irish people don't speak it or only use it as their second language. This video shows why adults in Dublin, in 1976, are eager to learn the Irish language.

Over the past twenty years, Ireland has grown to become a cultural and ethnically diverse country. With this in mind, in 2010, a school in Ireland decided to introduce Polish courses, after realising that a  large portion of children in their local population come from a Polish background, but don’t know the language well.

From Unió Deportiva Girona to Girona Futbol Club

The exact date of the birth of football in Girona is not easy to determine, but it looks like it happened in the early 20th century. The oldest club in Catalonia, Palamós FC, was founded in 1898, while the most important Catalan club, FC Barcelona, was founded a year later, in 1899.

In the city of Girona, we know that, in 1903, football matches were played on the Camp de Mart, in Devesa Park, and three years later, the first club of the city was founded with the name of Futbol Club Gironí.

From 1909 onwards, in the local press, we find the first reports of football matches in Girona.

In one of those, reporting on a match between the teams Sport Club Ampurdanés and Sport Gerona, the basic rules of the sport are explained to the readers: 'At each end of the field there are wooden frames, inside which you have to pass the ball to score a point (goal), as long as you don't do it with your hands or your arms'.

(Click here to see the full report)

Thejournalistic reports of this periodare full of English words - such as 'team', 'goal', 'goalkeeper', 'off-side' or 'kick' - which had not yet been translated into Catalan, and others such as 'corner' or 'penalty' that would end up being part of the commonly used Catalan language.

During the second decade of the 20th century, many football clubs spread in the city, among which are Girona Sport Club, Gerunda FC, Catalan, Girona Sports Centre or Strong, which as its name suggests was the most powerful of them. They were all amateurs, like Ateneu Social Democràtic, which was formed by workers coming from the Grober factory.

The existence of many small amateur clubs meant that none of them had enough potential to be able to compete at the regional level. This changed on 13 February 1921 with the foundation of Unió Deportiva Girona, which quickly became the most important team in the city.

Unió Deportiva Girona promoted the construction of the first football stadium, the Vista Alegre stadium, which was inaugurated on 29 June 1922. For the opening ceremony, a match against FC Barcelona was organised. At that time, FC Barcelona was the Spanish champion team. Its chair was Joan Gàmper and the team had football stars like Josep Samitier or Ricardo Zamora.

Unió Deportiva Girona was dissolved in 1930 due to financial debts arising from the construction of the stadium, but the gap left by UDG was immediately filled by a new club: Girona Futbol Club - founded just a few days later. Over the years, Girona FC  became the most important club in the city and the most successful.

Girona FC saw a golden age in the early 1930s, thanks to players such as Josep Iborra and Domènec Balmanya (who would later play for FC Barcelona). The main success was in the 1935-36 season, when the team took part in the play-offs to the First Division. Eventually though they  failed to qualify and, in the following years, the Spanish Civil War drastically reduced football activity.

Another important milestone for Girona football was the inauguration of the Montilivi stadium in 1970. This is the stadium where Girona FC currently plays. For the inauguration, they held the Costa Brava competition, with the participation of top teams such as Espanyol and Valencia from the Spanish league, Borussia Neunkirchen from Germany and San Lorenzo de Almagro from Argentina.

The construction of the new stadium did not bring the expected results and the team remained in lower divisions for many years. In the 2016-2017 season, the team achieved the desired promotion to the First Division and could finally play with the top teams of the Spanish league like FC Barcelona or Real Madrid.

Who was Nadia Comăneci?

Nadia Comăneci at the Olympic Games

Nadia Comăneci after retirement

Nadia Comăneci was the first Olympic gymnast to score a perfect 10

Born on the 12 November 1961, in Onești, a beautiful small town situated in the historical region of Moldavia, Nadia Comăneci is considered to be one of the best sportswomen of the last century, and one of the greatest gymnasts in the world.

Nadia started practicing gymnastics in her hometown aged 5, encouraged by her family. The famous gymnastics coach Bela Karolyi saw her turning cartwheels in a schoolyard and chose her to attend his experimental gymnastics school. She soon became the 'pièce de résistance' of the Romanian team.

In 1969, at the age of 7, Nadia enrolled in her first competition, the Romanian National Junior Championships, where she placed 10th. She was not discouraged by the results. She instead became more motivated to train harder and, in 1972, at the age of 11, she won her first national champion title in Cluj.

Nadia Comăneci's first major success was at the age of 13, when she won three gold and one silver medal at the 1975 European Championships in Skien,Norway. In the same year, the Associated Press named her 'Athlete of the Year'.

Her truly amazing performance came unexpectedly at her first Olympics, in 1976, when the 14-year-old Romanian gymnast astonished the entire world with her 30-second perfect routine on the uneven bars.

The judges awarded her a 10, the first 10 in the history of Olympic gymnastics competitions. Initially, this decision led to confusion as the board flashed up '1.00' instead, the scoreboard having only three digits to display scores such as 9.50, or 9.85.

As no-one had ever achieved a perfect score in gymnastics until Nadia Comăneci at the 1976 Summer Olympics, she earned the nickname: the 'goddess from Montréal'.

Over the course of her Olympics career, Comaneci would earn six additional 10s.

She was ranked BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year for 1976 and her photo was featured on the cover of Time magazine. Back home, the communist authorities from Bucharest awarded her the 'Hero of the Socialist Labour' title, being the youngest holder of this distinction.

In 1981, the Romanian government organised a tour for Nadia in theUnited States. People were anxious to watch the gymnast in action; the 'Nadia '81' tour was a huge success.

She retired from competitions in 1984, having a record of 24 medals won through hard-work, incredible talent, self-confidence and persistence at the Olympic Games, World Championships and European Championships, of which 16 were gold.

After her coach, Bela Karolyi, defected to the United States, Nadia Comăneci was banned from travelling in the western countries and was under constant supervision of the authorities, so she made plans to escape.

In 1989, just a few weeks before theRomanian Revolution, she crossed the Romanian-Hungarian border illegally, with a group of other young Romanians. Her journey took her finally to the United States, where she is, at present, active in many charities and international organisations and a passionate leader of a gymnastic academy for teenagers, together with her husband, Bart Connor.

She returned toRomaniain 1996, after the fall of the Communist regime, for her wedding, which was held in Bucharest and televised live throughout the nation, the reception taking place in the former presidential palace.

In the world of gymnastics, Nadia Comăneci is currently Sports Ambassador of Romania, the Honourary President of the Romanian Gymnastics Federation, the Honourary President of Romanian Olympic Committee, and a member of the International Gymnastics Federation Foundation.

She won the title of European champion three times in a row and took possession of the 'European Cup', being the first gymnast to achieve this performance.

Nadia Comăneci is the youngest recipient and the only person to have received twice, in 1984 and 2004, the Olympic Order, the highest award given by the International Olympic Committee. She has also been inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame.

In 2004, Nadia Comăneci wrote her memoirs, entitledLetters to a Young Gymnast, in which she described her difficult road to success, based on talent, hard work and commitment.

As some rules changed in gymnastics scoring, it is practically impossible for anyone to ever receive a perfect 10, so maybe Nadia's series of perfect 10s will remain the high point of Olympics history forever.

Ploughing championships

Share your sport story

Share your story →

Agricultural tests of skill and agility

Ploughing is one of the oldest human activities, central to the development of agriculture. Ploughing fields - either with horses or tractors - is full of skill and technique, trying to achieve straight lines and neat furrows.

Competitions in ploughing have been held for centuries - informal contests held in rural communities.

However, since 1953, these competitions have gone global.

The first ever World Ploughing Contest took place in Canada in 1953. Ireland hosted the second contest in County Kerry in 1954.

Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand and United Kingdom - amongst others - hold national ploughing championships.

In Ireland, the National Ploughing Championships - also known as the Ploughing Match - has been held since 1931.

The event combines a ploughing competition with a large agricultural fair, as well as competitions in bread baking, pole climbing and more. The event is one of the largest outdoor events in Ireland, now attracting more than 200,000 visitors over the event's three days.

The World Ploughing Championships have been held in many countries, all across Europe - from Slovenia to Spain, Sweden to Switzerland.

In 2020 and 2021, many ploughing contests had to be cancelled or postponed. Let's hope they will be able to return soon.

The 20th century car: from luxury and commodity to icon

It’s hard to imagine any 20th-century landscape without a car. The motorisation of society certainly is one of the most striking outcomes of a century of innovation. Cars were roaming the roads as early as the 1880s, but major leaps in engineering, technology, production methods, design and marketing would go on to completely change the role and the realm of the automobile.

At the source of 20th-century innovations in the car industry lies the growing need to automate production lines to allow constructors to keep up with the market’s demand for affordable cars.

By successfully implementing high-efficiency assembly lines, the industry helped turn the car from a gadget for the happy few into a practical tool to be used by many.

Following in the footsteps ofHenry Ford, a pioneer of innovation early on in the century, European brands such as Fiat, Citroën and Austin went on to rethink their production methods in the 1920s. While they did manage to conquer a slice of the market, cars from the US remained popular and many American factories opened up branches in Europe. To counterweight the growing success of the Americans, some countries put in place new tax laws and tariffs on imported goods.

The economic crisis of the 1930s and the Second World War severely damaged the luxury car business, urging the industry to produce more efficiently and to develop standards in materials, constructions and processes that would allow for low-price trade.

Postwar Europe saw the emergence of a new style in cars, instigated by Italian builders such asPininfarina. While ornamentation was minimal, the clean, elegant, streamlined designs hailed in an era of aesthetic reinvention, in which consumers chose their new car not only on the basis of functionality but of visual impact as well.

One of the most iconic cars of the century was the Citroën DS. The model first devised in the 1950s was baptised ‘DS’ as a reference to the French word ‘déesse’ (goddess). Ahead of its time both in terms of style and technology, the DS dismissed the standard sedan design and hinted at what would decades later become a trending aerodynamic approach.

Besides the aerodynamic lines, the technical innovation of the DS consisted mainly in the advanced use of hydraulic systems. While such systems were already used for assisted steering and brakes, in the DS they were applied to the suspension and offered an unrivalled soft ride, sometimes compared to a magic carpet.

Like the Citroën DS, some cars have become staples of postmodern design and continue to enthuse communities of fans that leave no occasion unused to revisit what they consider to be poetry in motion.

Celebrating the 30th birthday of the DeLorean in Ireland, 2011, RTÉ,In Copyright

As they are now a part of technology history, cars such as the DeLorean and the DS have turned into icons of the 20th century and moved on from the streets into our collective memory.

Dutch canoeist in the 1960s

As a young boy Anton (Toon) Geurts used to go for walks along De Dommel in Eindhoven, the Netherlands with his father. That stream is where Anton saw canoers for the first time and he instantly fell in love with the sport of canoein. After World War II, Anton and a friend built their very first
canoes from petrol tanks. They sawed the petrol tanks from airplanes that had crashed and then fused them together. The building of his own canoe was only the beginning of Anton’s dedication and willpower for the beloved water sport.

Anton was a precision craftsman at Philips and with a lot of negotiating he was able to get four hours per week off for his training. Friday after work Anton would then mount his bike and cycle the route from Eindhoven to Zaandam to train at the canoe club, de Geuzen. As a southerner, Anton had to compete with the canoers from the north. There was simply more water in the north and with that more canoe athletes from that region. But his talent, and even more importantly his willpower, were undeniable: in 1956, Anton qualified for the Dutch
Olympic team, only three years after he first set foot in a canoe.

Anton participated three times in the Olympic Games for canoeing: in 1960, 1964 and 1968. But the Games in 1964 in Tokyo, they were unforgettable. Only an hour after Anton had placed sixth in the K1 race he had to be ready for the K2 race with his teammate, Paul Hoekstra. It was bad weather during the K2 and the crowd weren’t backing Geurts and Hoekstra either. The favourites to win were the Romanians and the Danish. But in the final sprint the Dutch duo overtook the favourites and placed themselves for silver, three tenths of a second behind the Swedes.

Anton’s wife was tensely listening to the race on the radio from her home in Veldhoven. At 7am, Dutch time, that tenseness changed into excitement. Barefoot she ran outside across the square to announce to anybody who could hear that her Anton had won the silver medal.

A young man from Veldhoven who was able to go to the Olympic Games and then also bring home the silver medal? That didn’t happen very often. His employer Philips honoured Anton at the workplace and gifted him a television. From the neighbourhood, he was gifted a bike and the celebration was an extravagant one. The annual 'route of lights' in Eindhoven was on 18th September and, in 1964, the route also came through Anton's street - naturally with illuminated Olympic rings made by Philips. The cherry on top was an Olympic torch on the roof of his house.

From 1968, Anton became a trainer for canoeing and he inspired many boys in the
neighbourhood with his love and passion for the sport of canoeing. Next to being a trainer Anton kept working at Philips until his retirement.

The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision shared the video of theReturn of the Olympic athletes from Tokyo(1964) on its Facebook page in relation to theEuropeana Sport Collection
Dayon 9 September 2021.

One of the comments on the video was from Anton Geurts’ daughter; she shared a picture of his silver medal that she had saved for all these years. How special is that?! For the theme #EuropeanaSport she was invited for an online interview
to share her father's story with Europeana, Sound and Vision and the rest of the world.

TheSport Collection Daytakes place on 9 September in the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam. The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision, Europeana and Sportraad Amsterdam invite you to share your personal sports stories at the Europeana Sport Collection Day.

From cup to pot

Boost for body and soul

Ceremony & culture

A global phenomenon

A cup of wonder: how tea from China conquered the world

According to legend, tea was discovered when leaves fell off a tree in a pot of boiling water. The beneficial potion resulting from this coincidental collision was tasted and endorsed byShennong: a mythological ruler nicknamed ‘The Divine Farmer’.

For millennia, tea was consumed as a medicinal beverage, before it became a social drink and a staple of the daily diet. At that point, around the 3rd century CE, tea cultivation really took off. The intricate process of producing and preparing tea became the pinnacle of Chinese inventiveness and finesse.

After harvest, leaves have to be wilted, oxidized and fermented, fixed, rolled, dried and - in some cases - left alone to age for years.

Then sorting and grading, sifting and breaking, packing and sealing the tea conclude the process.

A plethora of guides and methods describing the intricacies of cultivating tea have been published throughout the centuries, both in and outside of China. Many travellers to China applied themselves to studying Chinese strategies and techniques, to later report on them in extensive publications.

For many photographers too, the elaborate process and almost ritual handlings needed to produce tea have proven to be a lasting source of fascination and inspiration.

As tea cultivation, preparation and consumption became part of a refined and formal ceremony with a social as well as a spiritual dimension, the need arose to switch from individual tea cups to larger pots in which the drink could be prepared. In the Song era (960–1279) a special pot used for brewing tea is mentioned for the first time.

From the 16th century onwards potters from the Jiangsu province used their local clay to produce dedicated brewing pots. The reddish  earthenware of theYixing teapothas an exquisite texture and pots tend to grow more characterful with long-term use.

The small format, short spouts and clay material make these teapots stand out from the porcelain, long-spouted vessels later created in China for export to the West, where tea was brewed and consumed in a different way.

Vessels specially made for storing tea became a necessity too. Tea needs to be kept in a dark space, ideally in an airtight container, preventing the aromas from diffusing and protecting the costly product from harmful exposure to moisture or dampness.

Classified on the basis of provenance, the type of tea plant used, the ratio of large tea leaves versus smaller, broken grades, and the manufacturing process, tea today comes in a plethora of forms, strengths and tastes.

Green tea, with its typical pale colour palette, lemony taste and slightly bitter zing still is mainly grown in China, as are the more smoky flavoured oolong and pouchong teas produced in the south.

Green tea in particular is a worldwide favorite of the health-conscious, as it is rich in natural antioxidants, contains caffeine as a booster and fluoride against caries. Furthermore, having tea is associated with stress relief and mindfulness. With its spiritual and physical health benefits tea continues to be at the very top of the leaderboard of most popular drinks in the world.

In China, ‘gongfu’ is the designation used for a particular tea brewing ceremony that aims at making tea ‘with skill’, so that it not only tastes good but also benefits the soul. By using a relatively high amount of leaves the brewer instigates a process that involves multiple infusions, each producing slightly different intensities and taste experiences.

Because of the symbolic aspect of preparing, sharing and consuming tea, it’s good to think before you sip: in Argentina you’ll insult your brewer by stirring your cup with the bombilla, while when Touareg tea is served you might be surprised by the panache with which it’s poured from great height.

In Russia, tea isn’t consumed with meals but during dedicated breaks. To prepare the brew, a samovar is used: a special device producing the strong-flavored ‘zavarka’.

While brewing as well as enjoying tea entail different ceremonial practices in different parts of the world, most cultures regard the offering of tea as a gesture of hospitality and politeness.

China tea reached mainland Europe with the Dutch East India Company early in the 17th century, followed by the English East India Company importing tea to London.

By the dawn of the 20th century, the whole world was sipping the aromatic beverage, from Kenya and Queensland to Russia and Peru.

What people’s ‘cup of tea’ entails exactly, differs from country to country: enjoyed with a lump of sugar by some, others will add honey or lemon, yak butter or condensed milk, mint leaves, cinnamon or tapioca balls.

So how do you prefer your cup of wonder…?

8 unusual activities that have been part of the Olympics

As you may know, the International Olympic Committee raised a few eyebrows when skateboarding was added to the Tokyo Games, as well as when it introduced breakdancing as an additional sport for Paris 2024.

Ahead of every Olympic Games, additional sports can be added and removed, and sometimes these are quite unusual. Skateboarding and breakdancing are far from being the only surprising sports that have appeared during the Olympics.

Since its beginning in Athens in 1896, there have been a wide range of examples - from croquet to poodle clipping. Some appeared just once or a few times, while others weren't even officially featured in the Games. Let's discover some surprising sports!

Tug-of-war was a sport featured in the Olympics from 1900 to 1920. Countries could enter multiple ‘clubs’, meaning teams, and could win more than one medal. For example, both the United States and Great Britain won the gold, silver and bronze medals respectively in 1904 and 1908.

You may have noticed that in 2021, synchronised swimming was renamed 'artistic swimming'. In this discipline, two swimmers must be synchronised with their chosen music and with each other. The Olympic programme has also featured solo synchronised swimming at the 1984, 1988 and 1992 Games. Then, the swimmers had to be synchronised only with the music. This might raise the question why ballet has not been an Olympic sport? That is a question for another article…

This sport featured at the male-only Olympic Games held in Athens in 1906 as an unofficial event. The competitors had to shoot at plaster dummies. It returned in 1908 where competitors actually fired at each other, but thankfully, no one was harmed because the bullets were made of wax and the duellists wore protective masks and uniforms.

Croquet has only appeared once in the history of the Olympic Games, in 1900. It was notable for being the first sport featuring women as competitors. However, it was not very popular -  with only ten participants (all French) - entering the competition, and just a single spectator. It never returned to the competition, although a variation of the game called 'roque' featured in the 1904 Olympics.

Plunge for distance diving enjoyed its greatest popularity in the late 19th and early 20th century. In 1904, it was included as an official event at the Olympic Games in Saint Louis. The goal was to dive into and then glide in water without making any additional movement for one minute. The person who travelled the farthest won.

However, the event was neither very popular nor convincing. A New York Times sports writer described it as ‘mere mountains of fat who fall in the water more or less successfully and depend upon inertia to get their points for them’.

Quite a few of these strange sports come from the 1900 Paris Olympic Games. Along with croquet, obstacle swimming and tug-of-war, the 1900 Games also featured horse long jump, an adaptation of the classic athletic event to horseback.

However, it wasn't a great success - the equestrian jumps were less long than those in the regular men's long jump. A Belgian army officer camed Constant van Langhendonck won the equestrian event with a jump of around 20 feet (6.10 metres), while Alvin Kraezlein won the regular contest with a jump of around 23.5 feet (7.18 metres).

Live pigeon shooting was included in the 1900 Paris Games, and more than 300 pigeons were shot and killed during the event. They were released from spring boxes, stationed in the middle of a fenced ring. In order to score a point, the bird had to fall inside that ring, with participants eliminated if they missed two birds in a row. It was the only time this sport featured in the Olympics.

Last but not least: poodle clipping. It was tried out for future Games at the Paris 1900 Olympics and never had the full status of an olympic sport, but it still seems pretty unusual. 128 competitors performed in front of a crowd of 6,000 in the Bois De Boulogne park, where they had to clip the fur of as many poodles as they could in two hours. So many questions come to mind… how did they ensure the poodles were the same size? Were they all equally docile? The winner Avril Lafoule didn’t seem to care much, having won after clipping a total of 17 poodles.

Nation's first sports college was founded in 1920

When we think of schools, we think of subjects like mathematics, literature, foreign languages and more. But in Denmark, there is a school dedicated to gymnastics.

Gymnastikhøjskolen in the Danish town Ollerup was founded in 1920, and was the country's first sports college.

It was founded by Niels Bukh, who had been teaching gymnastics to men and women in the town for several years. When the buildings he had been using became too small, Bukh founded a new school which could accommodate 100 students.

Over the years since 1920, the school has expanded to include new sporting facilities - in 1926, it was the location of Denmark's first swimming pool.

The swimming pool's architect Ejnar Mindedal Rasmussen won silver at the 1928 Olympics for his architectural drawings of the pool.

Elite teams from Gymnastikhøjskolen were very popular, touring the world in the 1920s and 1930s on trips to Germany, Japan, South Africa and Argentina among others.

By the 1940s, the school's founder, Niels Bukh - who was gay - had been developing gymnastics techniques for several decades. In the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm, he led the Danish gymnastics team. However, his legacy is marked by his collabortion with Nazi Germany during World War II, actively promoting Nazi ideals and cooperating in their plans for Denmark's future.

After the war, Bukh was arrested. In 1950, Arne Mortensen and Jørgen A. Broegaard took over the running of the school.

Today,Gymnastikhøjskolencontinues to be an important school for sport and gymnastic education for adults - with health and fitness courses, as well as dance, parkour and a physical education course that prepares people to join the police.

How did Věra Čáslavská protest the Soviet invasion at the 1968 Olympics?

The 1968 Olympic Games are remembered today for the 'Black Power' salute when Tommie Smith and John Carlos, two African-American athletes, raised their black-gloved fists in protest while the US national anthem played.

However, at the same Olympics, another participant protested politics, albeit in a more subtle way.

This is the story of Czech gymnastic Věra Čáslavská, whose 1968 protest curtailed her sporting career.

Věra Čáslavská was born in 1942 in Prague. By age 16, she was an accomplished gymnast and had already began an international sporting career, taking part in the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Moscow. There, she won gold and silver medals.

She first took part in theOlympic Gamesin 1960. In Rome, she won a silver medal with the Czechoslovakia team.

By the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo, she was a force to be reckoned with - she won four medals: three golds in the Vault and Balance Beam competitions, as well as a gold in the All-around competition and another silver in the team competition. The Japanese hosts gave her the nickname 'darling of the Olympic Games' (「オリンピックの名花」)

Outside the Olympics, her success continued - between 1964 and 1968, she won 19 gold medals in major international competitions. In 1967, she scored a perfect 10.

The 1968 Olympic Games were held in Mexico City in October.

A few months earlier - in August - Czechoslovakia had been invaded by four countries led by the Soviet Union. The invasion aimed to suppress the so-called Prague Spring, a series of liberalisation reforms which Czechoslovak Communist leader Alexander Dubček had attempted to set in motion.

137 Czechoslovakian civilians were killed in the invasion, and 500 were seriously wounded. Around 70,000 Czechoslovak citizens immediately left the country, migrating to Western countries, with many more following in later months and years.

The invasion also had an effect on Čáslavská's preparations for the Olympics. She had supported democracy movements within Czechoslovakia. In 1968, she was one of the signatories ofThe Two Thousand Words, a reform manifesto written by Ludvík Vaculík.

Due to her vocal opposition, she feared she would be arrested so she spent months training and preparing in the forests of Moravia, rather than a gymnasium. She was only given permission to travel to Mexico at the last minute.

These make-shift preparations did not seem to affect Čáslavská's dominance in Mexico. She won four gold medals and two silver, winning medals in all six events.

In Mexico, many Soviet gymnasts were not given a warm reception. Čáslavská's floor routine music wasJarabe tapatío(the 'Mexican hat dance') which made her popular with the local audience.

Before the Games, Čáslavská stated that she would 'sweat blood to defeat the invaders' representatives'. Despite her many victories, Soviet gymnasts affected the outcome for Čáslavská.

Čáslavská appeared to win the floor competition outright with a score of 9.9. However, the judging panel unusually upgraded the scores of Soviet gymnast Larisa Petrik, bringing her level with Čáslavská. They shared the gold medal. Earlier, another judging decision had cost Čáslavská a gold medal in the balance beam - she won silver, with Soviet Natalia Kuchinskaya taking gold.

Both of these decisions clearly angered Čáslavská - not just personally, but also politically.

During the medal ceremonies for both, as the Soviet national anthem played and the flags were raised, Čáslavská quietly protested by holding her head down and away.

Many Czechoslovakians respected Čáslavská's actions. In 1968, she was awarded Czechoslovakia's Sportsperson of the Year award for the fourth - but final - time.

HOwever, her protest was not appreciated by the authorities.

Because of this, she was not given the right to travel to participate in public sport events both at home and abroad, effectively forcing her into retirement.

During the 1968 games, she had married Josef Odložil, a Czech runner. Their daughter was born in 1969, and a son in 1974. Through the 1970s, Čáslavská worked in various jobs - including as a cleaner, a far cry from her previous sporting success.

In the 1980s, particularly after the Velvet Revolution of 1989, Čáslavská's professional prospects improved. She became an advisor to President Václav Havel on sports and social matters, and was the chair of the Czech National Olympic Committee.

In 1993, Josef Odložil - now her ex-husband - died after an argument with their son Martin. This, combined with ill health, led to depression which meant that she was rarely seen in public.

Through the 1990s and following decades, however, Čáslavská's legacy was recognised with a number of accolades, awards and titles - reflecting her status as the most decorated Czech gymnast ever and an athlete with courage and dignity.

Vera Čáslavská was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2015, and died in Prague the following year, aged 74.

Health, youth and strength in Scandinavian and German art

Vitalism was a trend in Scandinavian and German art around the turn of the 20th century which focused on health, beauty and sporting activity. Artists portrayed mostly young people (mostly young men) exercising often outdoors, often naked.

The trend came about as a reaction to a variety of societal developments and cultural movements at the end of the late 19th and early 20th century.

The industrial revolution across Europe through the 19th century had brought many changes for people living in cities, but it cannot be said that the growing industrialisation was good for people's health.

Cities became more crowded and polluted, while people working in factories and other industrial facilities worked extremely long hours in cramped and dirty environments with little regard for health and safety.

These changes in society led to movements focusing on health, physical activity and the emergence of what we now think of as modern sport. Many sports we play today were invented or formalised in the mid-to-late 19th century.

Modern football emerged in the United Kingdom around the 1850s, with teams often based around schools, factories or other workplaces. The ancient Greek Olympic Games were revived at the end of the 19th century - the International Olympic Committee was founded in 1894, with  the first Games being held in 1896, having built on various competitions that had taken place over the previous decades.

In the 1860s, the Sokol movement was founded in Prague - an organisation promoting gymnastics and exercise, based on the principle of 'a strong mind in a sound body'. It spread across many Slavic regions through the late 19th and early 20th century.

Sport and exercise were not just good for your body: it fed the mind and morality too. Sport was morally uplifting, producing good, strong, healthy Christian men - better to take part in sport than other less-moral activities.

At the same time, archaeologists were making more and more discoveries of ruins and artefacts in the sites of Ancient Greece. Following the archaeologists, artists and art historians travelled to Ancient Greek, fascinated by its ideals and seeing it as an idyllic pre-ndustrial time of health and vitality.

All these contexts led to vitalism: art dedicated to health, sport, youth and strength.

Vitalist art often used light colour palettes, with mostly male figures (often nude) are powerful symbols exercising in natural landscapes - on beaches, by the sea, the sun. Nature is shown as a revitalising force, reviving spirits and renewing healthy bodies.

Paintings and sculptures depict young men as athletes, swimming and riding horses.

The poster for the 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm featured nude youths waving flags of the participating nations is another example of such vitalist art from this period.

These artworks, with detailed, colourful and idealistic depictions of male bodies, have strong homoerotic undertones. Swedish artist Eugène Jansson - whose paintings often feature vitalist motifs - was gay, and often painted his lovers in his artworks. His - and the art movement in general - focus on naked male bodies can be seen as a defiance of societal norms at the turn of the 20th century.

These artistic and societal obsessions with strong, healthy bodies created ideals to which many people could not live up to. Such ways of thinking combined with racist ideologies about the kinds of bodies that were acceptable, particularly in the 1930s as the ideals of vitalism were seized upon by fascist movements across Europe.

13th century female semi-religious orders who created and transmitted vernacular literature

Women in the Middle Ages greatly contributed to the creation and transmission of literature, both Latin and vernacular. The Beguines were one of the most influential groups of women in this respect. They were an order of female semi-religious active largely in the 13th century in and around (present day) northern France, southern Germany, and the Low Countries.

Beguines were women who chose to live religiously but did so without vowing perpetual poverty or chastity, or enclosing themselves in convents thus keeping themselves firmly independent from institutional ecclesiastical authority. As a result, they were called semi-religious because they stood on the border between secular and religious life: officially, they were secular (outside of Church control) but performed a religious role within society.

They lived in ‘beguinages’, which could either be houses or entire towns where beguine women formed a community that lived and worked together. Primarily, beguines performed charitable works for their lay communities and would sometimes provide religious guidance. Some beguines even preached to the people.

One of the ways beguines contributed to the creation and transmission of vernacular literature was by writing spiritual (or mystical) texts in their local language. Some well known examples of such women are Hadewijch of Antwerp, Mechthild of Magdeburg, and Marguerite Porete (active in the Flemish region). Hadewijch probably spoke Latin, but chose to compose her devotional poems and visions in her native Middle Dutch. Mechthild, however, was likely not literate in Latin and as a result composed her visionary workThe Flowing Light of the Godheadin Middle High German.

These texts were widely popular. Indeed,The Flowing Light of the Godheadwas translated into Latin around the time of its composition, which attests to its popularity and indicates the religious authority that this vernacular text held for a Latin literate religious male elite.

Many beguines came from noble backgrounds and therefore would have been exposed to vernacular courtly literature in their youth. One of the ways we know that these women were actively engaging with secular texts is because references to courtly literature can be found frequently in mystical texts like Hadewijch’s and Mechthild’s.

They also encouraged the translations of extant religious texts into the vernacular. For example, an Old French translation and commentary on the popular Biblical book theSong of Songs(end 13th century/beginning 14th century) has been preserved. This commentary is associated with beguines. The fact that it is dedicated to the Virgin Mary and that the most prolific speaker in the commentary is the female character (the Bride) attests to a strong female influence on the production of this text.

It is unclear whether this text was composed by a male spiritual counsellor for a community of beguines or by a group of beguines themselves. What is certain, however, is the involvement of beguines in the creation and dissemination of a vernacular text inspired both by the Bible and contemporary courtly literature.

When did the Paralympic Games start and what is their history?

Please note:Some historical images and metadata referred to in this blog use words which are considered derogatory today.

The Paralympic Games now take place every four years, hosted in the same cities as the Olympic Games. These games - for athletes with disabilities - take their name from the Greek word παρά,pará, meaning 'beside' or 'alongside', referring to their status alongside theOlympic Games.

While the history of the modern Olympic Games stretches back to the 19th century, the Paralympic Games (and the disability sports competitions they developed from) are rooted in the mid-20th century.

Let's take a look at moments from the Paralympic Games' histories across Europe, illustrated by objects from cultural heritage collections.

The Paralympic Games developed from sports competitions which were first held in the United Kingdom in 1948.

Jewish-German born Dr. Ludwig Guttmann of Stoke Mandeville Hospital hosted a sports competition for BritishWorld War IIveteran patients with spinal cord injuries. 16 atheletes - 14 men and 2 women - took part.

The event took place on the same day as the opening of the 1948 Olympic Games in London. The event was repeated each year thereafter.

By 1952, the event had become international with Dutch participants joining the British athletes.

These games continued each year, known as the International Stoke Mandeville Games. From 1997, the games became the 'World Wheelchair Games'. In 2005, they were re-named 'World Wheelchair and Amputee Games', and 'International Wheelchair and Amputee Sports (IWAS) World Games' from 2009.

By 1960, the ninth Stoke Mandeville Games became the first official Paralympic Games.

Initially only athletes who used wheelchairs took part, with 400 athletes from 23 countries taking part in 57 events in 8 sports. The Games followed the Rome Olympics and used same venues.

The 1964 Paralympic Games were held in Tokyo, alongside the Olympic Games. In 1968, however, the Paralympics were not held in Mexico, alongside the Olympic Games.

Instead, the 3rd Paralympic Games were held in Tel Aviv, Israel in November 1968. 750 athletes from 29 countries took part in 181 events in 10 different sports.

The first Winter Paralympic Games were held in 1976 in Örnsköldsvik, Sweden. These were the first Paralympics in which multiple categories of athletes with disabilities could compete.

The 6th Summer Paralympics took place in Arnhem in theNetherlandsin 1980. The Soviet Union - who hosted the Olympic Games that year - had issued a statement denying the existence of any disabled people in their country.

1973 athletes from 42 countries took part in 489 events in 12 sports, with 12,000 people attending the opening ceremony.

From the late 20th century onwards, the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games have been hosted in the same city and country, sharing the same sport facilities.

The 2012 London Paralympics was one of the largest multi-sport events ever held in the UK and the largest Paralympics ever. One of the two mascots for the games was named Mandeville, paying tribute to the hospital which had decades earlier laid the foundation of the Paralympic Games movement.

Jefferson’s Plan for the White House

Andrew Mayfield’s Plan

Insight into early American Architectural Imaginings

The story of George Washington and the competition to design the residence of the President of the United States

The White House in Washington, D.C. is one of the world's best known buildings – close your eyes for a moment and you can probably picture it well. But it could easily have looked very different. In this guest post by HouseFresh and the Maryland Center for History and Culture, using archival documents and digital renders, we discover the White Houses that might have been.

In 1792, George Washington held a competition to design a house for the president. Irish-born winning architectJames Hobanbuilt the neoclassical mansion that would soon become known as the White House – and today its image is seared into our collective imagination.

The president personally considered at least six designs, but the runners-up were immediately consigned to history. Many of the original drawings are archived at theMaryland Center for History and Cultureand these alternative visions of the White House have now been recreated in a new set of digital renders. For the first time ever you can see what the White House could have looked like had a different competition entry been selected.

Vivien Barnett, Curatorial Assistant at the The Maryland Center for History and Culture, gave us some insight into what it takes to preserve these plans:

“The plans are currently housed in custom-made archival storage mounts. We use acid-free archival boards to sandwich each drawing, and most have a custom cut mat that provides a window into the mount so the object is still accessible in storage. Many are also covered with a sheet of mylar or acid-free tissue to provide further protection. Aside from that, they are stored in a closed flat-file unit in a temperature-controlled room.”

Out of the archive and realistically computer-generated, here are five visions of the White House that might have been.

Thomas Jefferson was Secretary of State at this time, and closely involved with the administration of the competition. But he was also an architect and enthusiast of classical European design. Experts attribute a losing entry labelled 'Abraham Faws' to Jefferson. The ‘real’ Faws submitted his own, amateurish entry, and Jefferson’s anonymous design was later attributed to Faws due to a clerical error.

Jefferson would move into the White House as president in 1801, describing the mansion as “big enough for two emperors, one Pope and the grand Lama.” All the same, he couldn’t help himself but expand on it, adding colonnades andother featuresto shape the White House as it now looks.

The competition to design the White House was part of a broader challenge to suggest architecture for Washington’s seat of power. Phillip Hart was an amateur architect – more likely a professional builder – who submitted proposals for both the president’s house and the Capitol.

Hart’s White House echoes his vaguely absurd Capitol sketches. The foreshortened top floor and faux-Renaissance style lacks the style and sophistication that Washington desired from a building that should, “in size, form, and elegance… look beyond the present day.”

Andrew Mayfield Carshores was a linguist and former British soldier and teacher. His simple design reflects pre-Revolutionary War architecture, characterized by America’s colonial period of Georgian, English-style buildings.

Carshore’ssteeply-pitched roofs are bordered with a lead walkway, with a rainwater reservoir in the roof of the main block. But to the judges, his work lacked a vital spark. According to architectural historian Hugh Howard, Carshore was a ‘gentleman amateur’ and his rejected entry may be the only building he ever designed.

Jacob Small submitted four entries to the 1792 contest. Author Patrick Phillips-Shrock highlights that Small’s White House designs were thought to be inspired by two iconic buildings from that time: Mount Vernon, George Washington’s plantation estate house, and the Maryland State House in Annapolis.

Small connects the stable and kitchen blocks to the main house via arcades. But his maze-like interior of hallways and mysterious staircases would have been awkward for the president.  Curiously, Small did anticipate oval-shaped rooms for the White House – but he failed to integrate them into his broader design in any meaningful way.

Originally from Ireland, James Diamond was an architect and builder. Diamond’s White House is set around a rectangular court. However, Diamond notes on his design that “the Open Court may be changed to a Picture Gallery and Lighted from the Top, which would have a grand Effect.”

Diamond’s design incorporates sophisticated design elements like Ionic columns and window frames capped with pediments. But the staircases are positioned inconveniently far from the entrance, and the overall grandness is thought to have been too ornate for George Washington’s tastes.

The contest to design the White House reflects democracy in America as it would evolve: the opportunity was open to everybody, but the prize went to a man whom the president already knew.

However, Hoban’s architectural proposal answered Washington’s requirements – and today, despite the additions and refinements over the years, it is hard to imagine the president’s house any other way. In fact, Hoban’s neoclassical structure would come to typify America’s federal architectural style. But HouseFresh’s digital renders of these archive blueprints are designed to help you picture how things could have been.

Translation versus inspiration

Chinoiserie

Crime & chronicles

Summer reading tips inspired by the Land of the Dragon

Summer is here and you may be looking for a good read to enjoy while travelling or relaxing by the pool. Why not try one of the many books written by European authors who were inspired by China? Or a staple of Chinese literature? Here are a few suggestions!

Quite a few European authors have dedicated themselves to translating Chinese stories. Among the very first were employees of cross-continental trade companies, such as the British East Indian Company. One of the early examples of literary translations of Chinese literature wasHaoqiu Zhuan, translated into English in 1761 asHau Kiu Choaan, the Pleasing History.

For the translators, working on these texts was often a useful exercise to learn Chinese. Yet their writings served as an important point of contact between the East and the West as well, offering Europeans a unique opportunity to discover new literature and new ideas.

During the Age of Enlightenment, China was seen by European philosophers as an exemplary country, run by a capable government consisting of skilled officials rather than inexperienced aristocrats. In France, Voltaire (1694-1778) wrote a play calledL'Orphelin de la Chine('The Orphan of China', 1753), inspired by a Chinese play from the 13th century. Voltaire adapted the original to fit European theatrical conventions.

This story is one you might have enjoyed reading in your childhood or (re)discovered through a film adaptation: Hans Christian Andersen’s fairy taleThe Nightingale.

The tale clearly conveys 'Chinoiserie', for instance in its description of the emperor’s palace: a lavish residence made of fine porcelain.

Perhaps you’re more into poetry? Many Westerners visiting China found inspiration in its rich culture and history. One of them was French linguist and archaeologistVictor Segalen(1878-1919), who wrote several poems influenced by Chinese poetry. He published his China-inspired musings under the titleStèles.

Segalen's novelRené Leÿsis also worth exploring. Here, the author recounts the adventures of a Western traveler in Beijing, who gets mesmerised by the enthralling China-stories of the titular character: a young Belgian who's tutoring him in Chinese.

Another well-known French poet, Paul Claudel (1868-1955), lived in China for 14 years and was a privileged witness to the end of imperial China. He composed several poems inspired by what he saw and experienced, from Chinese gardens to theatre, calligraphy and nature. The evocative writings are collected in the bookConnaissance de l'Est(1900).

Maybe you prefer a compelling detective novel? Then theJudge Dee Mysteriesmight just be something you'd enjoy.  China has a long tradition of criminal investigation stories. In 1948, the Dutch orientalist, diplomat and writerRobert van Gulik(1910-1967) published the first novel featuring Judge Dee: a fictional character based on a real detective!

Di Renjie, who lived in the 7th century during the Tang dynasty (618-907) was a statesman and magistrate who became the main character in a number ofgong'ancrime stories. Taking these as a point of departure, Robert van Gulik created an interesting fusion between Western and Eastern detective novels. Among others, he added ghostly elements while retaining the blueprint of traditional Chinese detectives by crafting each story out of three crime cases.

If historical novels are your genre of choice, why not try a genuine classic:Romance of the Three Kingdomsby Luo Guanzhong. Originating from the 14th century, the novel combines elements of history with myths and legends to evoke a China at the end of the Han dynasty. Covering a period from 169 to 280AD, the majestic semi-fictional chronicle features over a thousand characters in a total of 120 chapters.

A personalised account of more recent history is presented inBalzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress: a semi-autobiographical novel written by Dai Sijie. The book reflects upon theChinese Cultural Revolutionthrough the two teenagers that figure as its main characters. It was awarded several literary prizes and was made into a feature movie in 2003.

Once you've got a hint of the rich array of literature inspired by China, you might go looking for more... and there's plenty to explore! Next to books you might want to venture into China-flavoured plays or comics. We bet you might even be surprised at discovering Chinese links in your personal library. Who knows: you might just end up spending your summer re-reading your all-time favourites with fresh eyes.

This blog is part of ‘PAGODE: Europeana China’, a CEF-project co-funded by the European Union that focuses on Chinese cultural heritage preserved in Europe.

Playing for two decades in the 1920s and 1930s

In 1920, Latvia's first national team began playing football when the Latvian Football Federation was founded.

The national team's first game was played on September 24, 1922 against Estonia - the result was a 1-1 draw. In the game, forward Edvīns Bārda scored the first goal in the history of the Latvian national football team.

In 1924, the team participated in the Paris Olympic Games, playing against France, who, with home advantage, beat them 7-0.

In the 1930s, the Latvian national team became stronger and stronger, with the greatest success in the 1936-1938 seasons, under the leadership of Austrian coach Rudolf Stancel.

The team mostly often played matches against Lithuania, Estonia, Finland, Sweden and Poland.

In 1937, the Latvian national team was close to qualifying for the 1938 World Cup, the third World Cup tournament.

In the qualifying rounds, they defeated the Lithuania  - the score in the first match was 4-2, and the second match was a decisive 5-1 victory.

However, in the final qualification game in Vienna, Latvia lost to Austria 2-1.

In that period, Ēriks Pētersons is considered to be the most outstanding Latvian player, socring 21 goals in 63 games.

From 1939 onwards, due to World War II, the activities of the Latvian team were initially limited, and later stopped altogether.

On May 3, 1942, striker Jānis Rozīte - along with two FK VEF Rīga players Arnolds Boka and Leonīds Peičs - died in a bomb explosion at the VEF Stadium in Rīga.

The Latvians' last game was played was on July 18, 1940 against Estonia. In the same year, Latvia was occupied by the Soviet Union. It remained so until 1991, when the Latvian national team began to play once again, making the European Championships in 2004.

Summer exhibition at the Swedish National Portrait Gallery

At theSwedish National Portrait Gallery(a collection of Nationalmuseum Sweden), each summer a topic is highlighted in a small exhibition. This year, the exhibition isMigrants– showing how individuals born in other countries have contributed to life in Sweden.

In a 2014 exhibitionCrossing Borders, people from Sweden who works on an international level were featured. The portraits included were contemporary photographs, shown both at the Swedish National Portrait Gallery and at airports.

Migrantsis a kind of sequel toCrossing Borders. The table is turned and instead we focus on people who have moved from other countries to Sweden.

Some have come as a part of their professional career, some for family reasons, some as refugees. This time the chronology starts in the 17th century and continues until the present.

In this blog, I will spotlight three of the older portraits, showing that migration to Sweden has been taking place over several centuries.

Artists have always been crossing borders to find commissions. David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl was born in Hamburg. His generation lived through the Thirty Years’ War that devastated Europe, but also gave opportunities for those ready to grab them. Ehrenstrahl served as a secretary to the Swedish delegation during the peace negotiations.

Thereafter, the artist went to Sweden in the service of one of the commanders-in-chief. He caught the attention of the royal court and became the most important painter here during the second part of the 17th century.

The self-portrait was made late in Ehrenstrahl's life. He looks at us with a very confident air, well earned after a most successful career.

One of the largest media groups in Sweden today is Bonnier.

It started in the 1820s with three brothers – Adolf, Albert and David Felix. The family had their roots in Saxony, then one of the centres of book publishing in Europe. They expanded north, and the oldest brother Adolf was born in Denmark.

In 1827, Adolf Bonnier moved to Gothenburg, where he opened a bookshop and a lending library. Later, he established his business in Stockholm and the university town Uppsala. The portrait is made by an unknown artist, maybe in Copenhagen since the style is close to the Danish Golden Age in painting.

During the 19th century, the dream of Italy lured many artists to the south.

There the artists' model Maria Ricci met the Swedish painter Gustaf Plagemann. They fell in love, but religion was an obstacle. Ricci's Italian Catholic family did not want their daughter betrothed to a Lutheran. The couple had to elope to marry.

The portrait was painted in Sweden in the 1850s by Emma Ekwall. Maria Plagemann is depicted sitting in a theatre box – a space in public life which could also be accessed by a respectable woman from the middle classes.

These paintings, together with others of the same topic, are until the end of August shown inMigrants in the Swedish National Portrait Galleryat Gripsholm Castle in Mariefred. If you happen to be around, you are most welcome.

Friendship through Culture and Sports

Every four years, a sport and cultural tournament is held which brings together athletes from around the world to promote acceptance of sexual diversity.

The Gay Games are open to all who with to participate, and feature lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) athletes, artists and more.

Founded in the United States in the 1980s, the Gay Games have been held in Europe three times - in Amsterdam in 1998, in Cologne in 2010 and in Paris in 2018.

The first Gay Games took place in San Francisco in 1982. The Games, as envisioned by Olympian Tom Waddell, were originally intended to be called The Gay Olympics.

However, the International Olympic Committee sued the organisation over the use of the word 'Olympics' and - just 19 days before the competition was due to begin - the name was changed to the 'Gay Games'.

The fifth Gay Games took place in Amsterdam - the first in Europe - in August 1998, with the opening and closing ceremonies at the Amsterdam Arena (now called the Johan Cruyff Arena).

Around 15,000 participants took part in 29 different sports, with the event held under the motto 'Friendship through Culture and Sports'. Alongside the sporting competitions, a cultural event programme was also held.

For centuries, lighthouses have been keeping sailors and seafarers safe. While nowadays, many lighthouses are automated, for many years lighthouse keepers worked and even lived in their lighthouses.

This blog showcases a series of short films about lighthouses in different parts of Europe, looking at their architecture, history and heritage.

Rozewie is a small seaside village on the edge of the Gulf of Gdansk and the Baltic Sea.

This short film highlights the history of the village's lighthouse, hearing from people who have worked there and are preserving its heritage.

The story of Anna May

What’s in a name?

How the trope of the 'Dragon Lady' came about in the 20th century

She’s fierce, striking and very much in control, with a hint of mystery and irresistible charm. Highly intelligent, she possesses secret knowledge that enables her to get out of every tricky situation.

The Dragon Lady is a character you might have encountered in comics, movies, novels or computer games. As any trope, this one is rooted in social and cultural history, going back as far as the 19th century. Still, the first time the term was used to point to a fictional character was in the 1930s.

Who was the original Dragon Lady and what's the story behind her emergence in pop culture?

It was comic book author Milton Caniff who coined the term 'Dragon Lady' in his series Terry and the Pirates, c.1935. Yet the inspiration supposedly stems from a 1931 movie featuring Hollywood's very first Chinese star: American actress Anna May Wong, who was cast as one of the main characters in the crime mystery movie Daughter of the Dragon.

Her character's father, Dr. Fu Manchu, was a well-known Asian stereotypical character: a mad scientist and criminal genius very much belonging to the Yellow Peril-era, when an irrational fear of Eastern people emerged based on the belief that they posed an existential threat to Western civilization.

The same racial bias had been at the source of the Page Act issued in America in 1875: the first restrictive federal immigration law, regulating the instream of Asian women in the US. Seven years later, the Chinese Exclusion Act was added as an extension of that law, now also preventing men from entering the States. The Act would stay in place until 1943.

While the Chinese Exclusion Act was formulated against laborers and seemed to have an economically driven rationale, the Page Act stemmed from sociological and demographic motives. The American government wanted to limit and control the extent to which a Chinese American population would develop. The law alludes to the promiscuity of Chinese women and the supposed threat they posed to traditional family values.

In Europe, too, the 'Yellow Peril' ideology and anti-East Asian racial preconceptions were prevalent from the late 19th century onwards, German Emperor Wilhelm II (reigned 1888-1918) going as far as to use the expression 'Gelbe Gefahr' to legitimize European colonial efforts in China.

At the turn of the century, anti-Asian racist stereotyping rose to new levels over the eruption of the Boxer Rebellion (1899-1901) in which attempts were made by the locals  to drive colonial forces out of China. Europe wanted revenge for every Westerner killed. Soldiers were urged by the German emperor to attack the Chinese viciously and barbarously as they were considered to behave 'cowardly, like a dog, but also deceitful'.

The victory in the Boxer Rebellion didn't put a stop to the fear that China would eradicate western civilization. The danger was perceived on all levels, from politics and economics to moral and cultural decay.

Next to the Dragon Lady, other stereotypical notions of Chinese people emerged in popular culture, from the submissive China Doll or Lotus Blossom to the clumsy coolie and the big-toothed chop-chop. Along with the characterisations came a plethora of 'ethnophaulisms': derogatory terms used against ethnic minorities.

Seen against this background, the character of the Dragon Lady betrays a distinct negative bias. Her portrayal is not that of a strong, powerful and attractive woman but a deceitful, domineering character, using her sexuality as a weapon to destroy virtues such as modesty, morality, chastity and loyalty.

With the American and later European film successes of Anna May Wong, the unfortunate epithet Dragon Lady made its way into common vocabulary, becoming more widely used for actresses and characters of Asian descent.

A famous example is that of Ling in the Bond-movieYou only live twice. Played by actress Tsai Chin, Ling was portrayed as a beautiful yet lethal double agent, who assists in an attempted assassination of James Bond.

At the time when the blockbuster came out, Tsai Chin had a recurring role in five movies acting opposite Christoper Lee as the daughter of Fu Manchu. She would go on to battle for a better representation of Asian women in cinema throughout her career.

Beyond the big screen, powerful Asian women whose counter-current, decisive behavior was under close scrutiny, often became called Dragon Lady as well, even in historical contexts preceding the 1930s. Empress dowager Cixi, the last woman to rule China, was deemed a Dragon Lady. At the end of the 19th century, she effectively controlled the government for nearly 5 decades and was perceived as a reactionary force.

Soong Mei-ling or 'Madame Chiang Kai-shek' is among the most well-known 'Dragon Ladies' too.

As the wife of Chinese President Chiang Kai-shek and a force to be reckoned with in Chinese civic movements, she was active on the socio-political scene of her country with outspoken opinions and a wide public appeal.

In her efforts to support her people in the Second Sino-Japanese War, she undertook a tour through the United States to further her cause. She was the first Chinese person to address both houses of Congress of the US, and appeared on the cover of Time magazine three times throughout the 1930s and 1940s.

Trần Lệ Xuân, the wife of Ngô Đình Nhu - the president of South Vietnam’s brother and chief advisor during the late 1950s - was not only designated Dragon Lady, but Tigress of Saigon, Lucretia Borgia and The Queen Bee as well.

She had an outspoken personality and was known for her efforts to establish 'morality' laws. Denouncing the strong influences of the US in her country, 'Madame Nhu' became a concern to American authorities, all the more after her projected 'triumphant lecture tour' in the States turned into a highly charged political conflict in 1963.

When her husband and the president were killed during a coup in South Vietnam and all the family's property was confiscated, Mrs. Nhu was forced into exile, spending the rest of her life in France and Italy.

As the term 'Dragon Lady' went from historical reality to fiction and back, the stereotype it conveys has stayed alive throughout the 20th century - and beyond. Still, decades after Anna May Wong, many an Asian actress gets cast as a character boasting the Dragon Lady traits - from Lucy Liu inCharlie's Angelsto Michelle Yeoh inTomorrow Never Dies.

While on the surface they are featured as forceful and powerful, they also are portrayed as violent and threatening, with a sexual attraction that echoes the accusations made more than a century ago. Much like the femme fatale, the bombshell and the vamp, the Dragon Lady has entered pop culture and gained a sense of normalcy that obscures much less innocent historical wrongs.

This blog is the result of a collaboration between two CEF-projects co-funded by the European Union:PAGODE: Europeana China, focusing on Chinese cultural heritage preserved in Europe, andEuropeana XX. A Century of Changededicated to the 20th century and its social, political and economic changes.

Racing horses between two churches

The name steeplechase is now given to an athletic race, where athletes race over hurdles and water jumps. Olympic gold is the highest achievement that an athlete can reach.

But the name steeplechase actually originated in a horse race, first held in Ireland in the 18th century.

As the name might suggest, that very first race took place in 1752 between two steeples in rural county Cork in the south of Ireland. At that time, church steeples were among the tallest buildings in the landscape.

On that night, Cornelius O'Callaghan and Edmund Blake were at dinner at Buttevant Castle, having a good time.

They made a bet between themselves to race from the steeple of Saint John's Church in Buttevant to that of Saint Mary's Church in the town of Doneraile.

The distance was around 4 miles, crossing countryside and rivers. The winner would be the first to touch the base of the steeple in Doneraile. The prize? More than 600 gallons of port.

Sadly, history has not recorded who actually won the race. But that race has gone down in history, with steeplechase races becoming a tradition.

By the early 1800s, races over fences on prepared race tracks were taking place in England, with the first recognised English National Steeplechase taking place in March 1830. Such steeplechases races can also be known as point-to-point races.

In 1839, the British Grand National race at Aintree was established, a race that is still run today over roughly the same distance of around 4 miles.

Today, steeplechase horse racing takes place in countries around the world - a tradition traced back to County Cork in 1752. And that sport has lent its name to a race between Olympic athletes over hurdles and water.

When ice-cream entered the scene

Ice cream skills

Homemade ice cream

Scandinavia's largest ice cream factory

Ice cream - a part of everyday life

When ice cream travelled north

A summer without ice cream is unimaginable to many. In Europe, the most northern countries are amongst those with the biggest passion for ice-cream; Finland, Sweden and Denmark eat most in Europe.

With a deep dive into the Swedish history of ice-cream, we'll take a look at when Swedes started to perceive ice cream as an everyday product and why a small town in rural Sweden once had the biggest ice cream factory in Scandinavia.

The first time a dessert started to resemble modern ice cream was probably in the first half of the 17th century when Catherine di Medici's sugar bakers froze fruit puree or juice.

The cold dessert quickly became a trend among the French upper class and the first ice cream parlour opened its doors in Paris in the 1660s. It was not until the 19th century that ice cream became available to the general public, although it was still a luxury. In contrast to many other luxurious foods, ice cream was not exclusive because of its ingredients, but because of the complexity of making it.

In Sweden, the success of ice cream began in the 18th century. For example, recipes for 'glace' are found in Cajsa Warg's cookbook from 1755 (the French word was usually used at that time, but the Swedish word for ice cream, 'glass', shows its inheritance). She already wrote about ice cream based on milk and cream which became common in the 18th century. Before that, ice cream consisted of ice or snow mixed with, for example, fruit, honey or spices. It was called 'sharbat' in Arabic, which we recognise in the word for sorbet.

The Swedish public discovered ice cream in the middle of the 19th century, when immigrants from Italy, Switzerland, Germany or Austria began to open ice cream parlours in Stockholm.

The first street sales began in 1890 which had exactly one flavour: vanilla. Ice cream consisted of milk, eggs, sugar and vanilla. There was more variety after World War I, when ice cream cones and other flavours became popular. The ice cream still had a different consistency compared to what we are used to today.

The complicated preparation process was what made ice cream a luxury item for a long time - so that only the upper class could afford. First, you needed the ability to refrigerate food, with snow, ice or a coolant with saltpetre, for example. In the picture above, you can see how ice and snow were collected during the winter to chill food until summer.

Before the invention of the ice-cream maker, people used different forms of tin or copper, which were then placed in ice or snow to freeze the contents. There were ice-cream moulds in two halves which were filled with the mass and frozen to give the ice-cream different shapes.

To give ice cream the soft texture we know today, a mechanical process is needed that could break up the developing ice crystals during cooling. An ice cream machine was needed! In 1751, Joseph Gilliers introduced thesorbetière: a freezer box in the middle surrounded by a mixture of ice and salt. The ice cream had to be turned regularly until it was completely frozen.

The Husqvarna 'glacemaskin' was an early version of ice cream machines. It consists of different parts: a cylindrical cooling box, with a wooden whisk, placed in a wooden bucket. The whisk is driven by a crank with gears that hook into cogs on the lid.

This led to the development of the ice cream machine, which relies on constant movement to freeze ice cream evenly and quickly. You can see a (still working) Husqvarna model in the picture above. It could take hours to freeze the ice cream, turning the ice cream again and again.

The industrialisation of ice cream production took off after World War II, and from the 1950s onwards glass consumption has increased steadily in Europe.

Sörmland played a special role in the success of ice cream in Sweden. It was here that a significant part of Swedish ice cream was produced after ice cream production became an industry.

In the USA, the first ice cream machine was invented in 1927, facilitating industrial ice cream production. Eric Wilhelm Hanner, the son of a director at Mjölkcentralen, now Arla, travelled there to learn about the future of dairy.

He came back from his study trips to Denmark and the USA and was absolutely convinced that ice cream was the future for Mjölkcentralen. But the directors were sceptical. In the end, they hesitantly agreed to his idea of trying to produce ice cream industrially, because they could use their surplus milk fat and butter for it.

Puck was the name of Mjölkcentralen's ice cream company at the time, and the first ice cream with the same name was launched in 1935 - and it was a great success.

During World War II, many ice cream ingredients were rationed and competition between the various ice cream manufacturers was fierce. In 1942, Glace-Bolaget, GB, was formed by three of the former competitors, including Puck Glass. Eric W. Hanner became the first director.

After the war, interest grew and larger production facilities were required: in 1957, GB opened Scandinavia's largest ice cream factory in Flen, which still exists and produces ice cream - about 50 million litres a year. In fact, it is still Sweden's largest ice cream factory. There were also ice cream factories in Strängnäs and Nyköping, two other cities in Sörmland county.

The 1950s were the year of ice cream: the American teenage culture made ice cream more and more popular, and in the hot summer of 1955 alone, ice cream production increased by 50 percent - and yet Swedish ice cream manufacturers had to import ice cream from Denmark because Swedes couldn't get enough of it.

More and more households in Sweden also had a refrigerator with a freezer compartment or even a freezer box. Sometimes they also rented space in a collective freezer compartment, of which there were around 30 000 in Sweden. The ice cream van delivered the ice cream to the door and so it quickly became an everyday commodity.

Since then, many different varieties of ice cream have been developed, in different shapes and with lots of flavours. Over the past twenty years, consumption of ice cream has declined in Sweden, yet Swedes were always among the nations with the greatest appetite for ice cream. However, during the corona pandemic, ice cream sales have increased again, especially ice cream that can be eaten at home or is sold in large packs.

Still going strong in the north of England

It's a Monday evening in the early summer. We've got the living room windows open to let the scent of the newly blooming roses in. Every few seconds we hear a distant clink, and an occasional cheer. Up on the village green, just outside the village pub and finally, after a hiatus of a year due to the coronavirus pandemic, an almost-crowd of local men (it does seem to be a male thing) has gathered to play a few ends of quoits, pints of beer in hand.

The version of the game that they're playing (called the 'northern game') has been going on in villages around England for close to 150 years (Scotland and Wales have their own version).

A 'quoit' - pronounced 'k' as in 'key', 'oy' as in 'boy' and 't' as in 'tin' - is a heavy iron or steel ring about 14cm in diameter and weighing around 2.5kg.

Set into the ground are two pairs of concrete rectangles, each with a wooden bar (a toe rail) across one end, marking where a player must stand, and a square pit of clay at the other end in which there’s a metal spike or stake (the hob).

The aim is to throw the quoit from one end of the pitch to the other end (a distance of around 10m), scoring points for the closest quoit to the hob - hence the metallic clink when it gets close and the cheers from the crowd when it goes right over (a ringer).

There's atheorythat quoits is related to the discus and was brought to Britain by the Romans. But it might also be derived from the old pub game of throwing horseshoes at a target on the ground.

Either way, it's popular in the Yorkshire Dales, one of the UK's National Parks, where there's enough players for a two-division league.

Many of the villages have their own quoits pitches - usually close to the pub, as Stan Smith, Chairman of theLower Dales Quoits Leaguepoints out, 'A game of Quoits is inexorably associated with a pint at the village pub'.

Most of the time, the clay pit and hob are covered over by a metal or wooden cover, causing visitors to stop and speculate over the mystery of this thing in the ground. Is it access to the drains? Part of the children's playground? Sometimes when I'm passing and hear this conversation, I let them in on the answer. Sometimes I don't, and the mystery remains.

Chinese export paintings: testimonies of global trade

When travelling abroad you might buy some local gifts for your relatives, friends and yourself. But did you know that Chinese craftsmen produced a special kind of souvenir for Westerners over two centuries ago?

In the 18th century, the Chinese empire was an isolationist, closed-off country. Only the port of Canton (Guangzhou), on the south coast, was open to foreign merchants. There, the Western trade companies from France, England, the Netherlands and Sweden bought goods like silk, porcelain and tea.

Isolated from the continent, Western merchants had to live and conduct their business only in the area of the port of Canton, on an island called the 13 Factories. This place was the only « window » for merchants to get a view of China. Luckily, they could also virtually visit China through a particular type of art, known as the Chinese export paintings or Chinese pith paintings.

The mass-produced  paintings were exclusively made for foreigners. Most of them were brushed on pith paper: a cheap, spongy material made with the earth of a shrub native from southern China. Because of the nature of the paper, the paintings were very fragile.

Most of these paintings were made by a team in a studio. Painters used watercolour or gouache (oil paintings were less common), producing vividly colourful impressions of China. Another technique used was glass reverse painting, showing Chinese or sometimes European subjects. Glass reverse painting is a delicate and difficult art, which consists of applying paint to a piece of glass. To see the painting in its full glory, the glass needs to be reversed.

Because these export paintings were generally made by craftsmen and not artists, they weren’t considered to be an art form by the Chinese, unlike calligraphy or ink paintings. This may be the cause for it taking such a long time before Chinese export paintings became a serious object of historical and artistic study.

Trade in Chinese export paintings proved very lucrative, as they were cheap to produce and easy to transport. Sold alone or in an album, the range of subjects went from flowers, animals and landscapes, to scenes of daily life and processes of manufacturing products like tea or silk. These depictions gave foreigners a taste of China and answered to the European taste for exoticism.

Having a painting from a Chinese studio became very fashionable in Europe. Some studios and their owners - such as Tingua, Youqua, Sunqua and Puqua - became famous. Western newspapers advertised where to find the best painters. In the 19th century, after the two opium wars, more ports in cities like Shanghai and Hong Kong opened to foreign merchants and new painting studios opened there as well. You could even find Chinese export painting studios in neighbouring Asian countries and colonial establishments like Manilla, Batavia (today’s Jakarta), Surat or Ceylon (today’s Sri Lanka).

With the development of photography, Chinese export painting became less popular. Some manufacturers followed the market  and opened what would become the first Chinese photograph studios. Others started copying photographed portraits to paintings.

Some of the export paintings that ended up in Europe today form a magnificent testimony of the exchange between and mutual perceptions of Europe and China. They're also a fitting illustration of the history of global trade, more than a century before the start of post-industrial globalisation.

This blog post is a part of thePAGODE project, which explores Chinese cultural heritage in Europe.

Jaakko Julkunen was a Finnish photographer and photojournalist whose work portrayed both famous and everyday people in Finland through the middle of the 20th century.

Born in 1938 in eastern Finland, Julkunen began working in photography in the 1950s.

By the 1970s, Julkenen had started working for Helsingin Sanomat, the largest newspaper in Finland. Julkunen worked in regional offices for the newspaper, often portraying rural life in regions in the east of Finland.

Julkunen retired in 2000, and died in January 2011. His legacy lives on in his photography, a selection of which we have chosen here.

An Olympic of firsts

The first Olympic Flame

Introducing women’s athletics and gymnastics at the Olympic Games

Breaking records

The first-ever parking symbol

What happened at the 1928 Olympic Games in Amsterdam?

With the Tokyo Olympic Games underway, we look back to one of the Olympic Games that saw a number of important milestones - the 1928 Olympic Games in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

Amsterdamhosted the Olympic Games from July 28 to August 12 1928. A total of 46 nations were represented by 2,883 athletes, including 277 women.

The 1928 Games were memorable because they introduced a series of Olympic firsts: the number of female competitors more than doubled, Asian athletes won gold medals for the first time and the Olympic flame made its first appearance in the modern era.

During the Opening Ceremony and, for the first time, the Parade of Nations started with the team from Greece, which holds the origins of the Olympics, and ended with the host team - the Dutch - marching in last. This tradition - Greece-first, hosts-last - has been part of the Olympic Games ever since.

The 1928 Games were also the first to introduce Coca-Cola as a sponsor.

At the time, the company sent a boatload of 1,000 crates of the soda to accompany the U.S. athletes to Amsterdam. The Coca-Cola Company is the longest-standing partner of the Olympic movement that continues until this day.

The idea for the Olympic flame comes from ancient Greece, where a sacred fire was kept burning throughout the celebration of the ancient Olympics on the altar of the sanctuary of Hestia.

In 1928, for the first time, a symbolic fire was lit during the Games of the modern era. The fire was lit in a cauldron that was placed at the top of a tower in the stadium in Amsterdam, which had been designed by renowned Dutch architect, Jan Wils.

The Olympic flame has been part of the Summer Olympics ever since. The torch relay, however, would not take place until the 1936 Summer Olympics.

Despite objections - including the former president of the International Olympic Committee, Baron Pierre de Coubertin -  the 1928 Olympics saw the introduction of women's events in the athletics and gymnastics programme.

Five women's athletics events were added: 100 metres, 800 metres, high jump, discus, and 400 metre hurdles.

The winner of the 800 metres was Lina Radke-Batschauer on Germany's return to the Olympics after a 16-year absence caused byWorld War Iand then having had to serve a 10-year probation for its part in that conflict.

However, at the end the race was spoiled when many of her competitors finished in a state of exhaustion. Women were not allowed to run such long distances again in the Olympics until 1960.

Athletes from 28 different nations won gold medals in Amsterdam, a record that would last for 40 years.

For the first time, Asian athletes won gold medals. Mikio Oda of Japan won the triple jump, while his teammate, Yoshiyuki Tsuruta, won the 200m breaststroke.

Athlete Kinue Hitomi was the first woman to represent Japan at the Olympics, the only female athlete for Japan in 1928. She entered a number of events, winning silver in the 800 metres race.

The team from India also swept to victory in field hockey, beginning a streak of six consecutive gold medals in the sport.

Like other cities around Europe in the late 1920s, the streets of Amsterdam were filling up fast with cars. During the Games, this issue was more pressing than ever as Amsterdam had limited car parking spaces. The organisers were forced to look for a way to solve this issue quickly.

As a solution, a number of new parking sites were provided and a special parking symbol was launched to show foreign visitors where they could park. The white P on a blue background was to become the international traffic sign for parking, which is still used today.

Few texts have had as much impact on Western monasticism as the Rule of Saint Benedict. Written by Benedict of Nursia (d. 547), the rule offers a well-suited and practical guide for communal religious life, attaining monastic ideals by governing the monks’ entire day. The Rule of Saint Benedict has been adopted by several monastic orders, including prominent orders such as the Benedictines, the Cluniacs, the Cistercians, and the Carthusians.

The Rule of Saint Benedict dates from the early sixth century. In writing it, Benedict was not moving into uncharted territory: in the fourth and fifth centuries, several monastic rules had been written, by important theologians as Pachomius, Basil of Caesarea, and Augustine.

Benedict relied on these rules: several parts of his text can be traced back to precepts found in Augustine’s rule. Benedict’s main influence appears to have been the so-called Rule of the Master, written only shortly before Benedict’s. Unlike the earlier rules, the Rule of the Master did not only offer spiritual contemplations, but also a clear framework to structure monastic life with. Benedict used this framework and many of the topics in it - though not without careful and extensive revision and altering to suit his own ideas.

Lastly, he found usable material in the writings of John Cassian, whose work De Institutis coenobiorum contains advice on the organisation of a monastic community. Another work, Collationes Patrum, teaches the wisdom of the Egyptian hermits (known as Desert Fathers).

The Rule deals mostly with practical matters. A day revolved around eight moments of prayer, the hours, divided by periods of personal study or manual labour. This emphasis on both intellectual and manual labour is reflected in the Benedictine motto ‘Ora et labora’ (Pray and work).

The Rule governs, for instance, the course of meals, the reception of guests, and provisions for the monks with specific tasks, such as the kitchen staff. Monks’ activities were also prescribed in detail. Apart from the canonical offices and Holy Mass, they ought to perform manual labour or further educate themselves through reading and memorising.

Benedict’s Rule puts much more emphasis on reading than the works it was modelled on. The Augustinian rule mentions it only twice - one of which is to prohibit reading other than at fixed hours. The Basilian rule does not even mention reading.

The practical nature of Benedict’s Rule surely added to its popularity, which is mirrored in its preservation.

The text is found in an impressive amount of manuscripts. The oldest extant copy dates from ca. 700 in England. It shows signs of the process of copying an earlier manuscript, now unfortunately lost. Following the invention of the printing press, multiple printers throughout Europe published copies of Benedict’s Rule. Of one of these editions, printed in the year 1500 in Venice, no less than 157 copies still exist.

World's largest multiple day marching event

In the 20th century, the International Four Days Marches ('de Vierdaagse') - the largest multiple day marching event in the world - became a regular sport event in the Dutch city Nijmegen. Usually held in the third week of July, the Four Days Marches are cancelled this year for the second time in a row due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In this blog, Ernest Verhees from the Regional Archive of Nijmegen gives an insight into the Four Days Marches and the history of walking as a sport, through the Archive’s photographs and information about participants.

The origin of the Four Days Marches Nijmegen lies in sporting events for army units held all over the Netherlands between 1904 and 1908. The goal of these events was to improve the physical condition of conscripted soldiers. In 1909, the Dutch Association of Physical Education (now the KNBLO) began organising four days of marching, which started from as many as ten different places in the Netherlands. That first year 306 people marched, most of whom were soldiers.

From 1910, the Vierdaagse became an annual event, based in a different town each year. Mobilisation during World War I meant that no marches took place in 1914 and 1915. In 1919, the first woman completed the route. The 1928 Four Days Marches was the first to have international participants. Germans, British, Norwegians and French nationals marched alongside the Dutch.

In 1937, over four thousand people participated in the event. The Four Days Marches were slowly changing from a long distance march organised by soldiers for soldiers into a walking event organised by a civil organisation (in which soldiers also took part).

After World War II, the number of participants continued to rise. By 1960, there were approximately 15,000 walkers. Since then, the number of people has increased by 10,000 each decade; participation has now peaked at 45,000.

The event had an overnight stop in Nijmegen for the first time in 1912. Thanks to the hospitality shown in the Prins Hendrik barracks, the marching event started to visit the city regularly. In 1925, the Four Days Marches settled in Nijmegen.

Around 1930, the international interest in the event became obvious throughout the country and other cities applied to host. However, Nijmegen had proven its hospitality and the unique and varied walking routes in the area meant the Four Days Marches remained there.

The walkers from all over the world are accommodated in schools, public buildings and peoples’ homes. Nijmegen is now pre-eminently the Four Days Marches city.

The organisation behind the Four Days Marches has been located in Nijmegen since 1998.

The Dutch Association of Physical Education (NBvLO) was founded in The Hague in 1908 by military officers who wanted to promote physical education to people from all layers of society. Their main concern was the resilience or defence of the country through a healthy population, especially strong and fit men.

Their ambition to become the most important sport organisations of the Netherlands didn't succeed. From the 1920s, the NBvLO only organised walking marches and became one of the nationwide walking associations. With the 50th anniversary in 1958, it received the predicate 'royal'. A long process of mergers of different national walking associations ended in 2015 with the founding of the Royal Walking Association of the Netherlands (KWBN).

In 2012, the Regional Archive of Nijmegen received a large supplement to the archive of the KNBvLO it had already possessed for thirty years. Two parts of these archives deserve special attention: a collection of photographs and the registration lists of the participants.

More than 2,000 photos of the Vierdaagse in Nijmegen can be found in Europeana, available under a public domain license. Most are dated before 1940 and not only give a view of the walkers but also of the people and surroundings of Nijmegen and of the changes in support, transport and festivities during the 20th century.

The most important files in the archive of the organisers KNBvLO are records with the participants’ registration. In response to the 100th Vierdaagse in 2016, there were many extra activities about the history of the event. For the Regional Archive of Nijmegen, this was a good reason to digitise the administration of the participants from 1921 until 1987.

Besides digitising and presenting the registers and lists online, the archive started a project to make these lists more searchable. Using the crowdsourcing platform ‘Vele handen’ (many hands), it was possible to complete this project in six months with the help of volunteers from all over the Netherlands.

From that moment on, on the websitewww.regionaalarchiefnijmegen.nl, you can find the names and data of participants until 1939. Because of privacy regulations, the names from 1946 until 1987 can only be searched on location or by request.

History of an annual sailing race on the largest lake in Central Europe

Think sailing and you would be forgiven for thinking of luxury yachts and the upper classes.

In Hungary - home to Lake Balaton, the largest lake in Central Europe - it was certainly something of an aristocratic affair. The first large sailing boat on Lake Balaton was the salt carrier Kristóf. It was built byCount Pál Festeticsin 1753. At the end of the 1700s, his son,György Festeticsintroduced the fashion for non-commercial sailing to Hungary when he invited royal guests to sail aboard Phoenix - the first large sailing boat on Lake Balaton. Launched in 1797, the ship became a symbol of Hungarian progress and development.

In 1866, thanks to the tabloid news that Elisabeth of Austria would spend the summer in Balatonfüred, sailing became a more popular pursuit. Magnates brought sailboats to Lake Balaton and renewed the infrastructure around the lake to provide the queen with entertainment.

The first Hungarian sailing club, the Balaton-Füred Yacht Association, was formed in 1867 with members from noble families such as the Károlyi, Széchenyi, Batthyányi and Festetics families.

As Sissy's visit due to the Prussian-Austrian war was cancelled - much to the disappointment of the Hungarian magnates - the desire to sail waned. In the 1880s, due to the high maintenance cost of the vessels, there were only about 70 yachts on the lake.

In 1884 the Balaton Sailing Club was founded, Crown Princess Stéphanie of Belgium, wife of Crown Prince Rudolf von Habsburg, became the patroness of the club, so the following year the name was changed to Stefania Yacht Club. The club organised annual regattas on a 40 km course.

The Hungária Yacht Club was founded in 1933 and launched a non-stop, speed sailing competition - the Blue Ribbon Regatta. Tradition had it that a blue ribbon was worn on the mast of the fastest sailing ship in the seas, and so competitive sailing on Lake Balaton was established in this tradition. The first Blue Ribbon Regatta was held in 1934.

The Balaton Blue Ribbon is one of the four longest and oldest round-the-lake races in Europe. The race distance is 160 km, which the competitors initially had to complete without a time limit but now have to complete in 48 hours. The route goes from Balatonfüred to Balatonkenese, Siófok and Keszthely and back to Balatonfüred. The fastest to sail the route in a clockwise direction is the winner.

The timing of the race is always dependent on the moon, being held on a July weekend closest to a full moon. There is a practical reason for this. The race starts at 9am but many boats finish late in the evening or at night, so the full moon helps them navigate.

The most successful sailing boat was the wooden Tramontana, winning the race seven times between 1940 and 1989. The first female helmsman to win was Evelyn Gordon, who also won the race with Tramontana in 1940.

On the tenth Blue Ribbon in 1955, István Németh and his crew set a new record time with the 75-foot cruiser Nemere. Their time of 10 hours 40 minutes would not be broken for 57 years.

The most successful skipper in the history of the Blue Ribbon is Farkas Litkey, who has won the Blue Ribbon 13 times so far.

Since 2014, both monohull and multi-hull (catamaran, trimaran) ships have been allowed to  compete. Thanks to the development of modern technology and new materials, carbon fibre 'flying' Foiler yachts also compete and break speed records regularly. And, in 2001, the record for the number of participants was broken as more than 660 boats entered the sporting event.

Of course, the Blue Ribbon Regatta is not the only sailing activity on Lake Balaton. Sailing began to become more and more popular among young Hungarians in the 1980s, including those from deprived social backgrounds who could apply to state associations for the opportunity to learn how to sail a boat without needing to own one.

Several films, which have now become iconic, were made starring the famous Hungarian actor and sailorIstván Bujtor(1942-2009), who promoted sailing on Lake Balaton. For almost three decades, he was the helmsman of the famous cruiser Rabonbán, modeled on an earlier vessel of the same name which won the first Balaton Blue Ribbon Regatta in 1934.

In 2021, the race will start from Balatonfüred on 22 July. This is the first year that theNational Archives of Hungarywill host aEuropeana collection dayas part of theEuropeana Sportproject.

Hidden photos, diaries and memoirs documenting nearly eight decades of the race will be collected from former participants, sailors and family members. If you can, come and see it from Fonyód or Tihany, as it is a stunning sight of hundreds of white sails stretching against the wind on the sparkling blue water.

Hajj is the annual pilgrimage to the sacred city of Mecca, the holiest city in Islam and the birthplace of the Prophet Muhammad. Discover the longstanding tradition of offering intricately produced textiles to the holy shrines.

Every year Muslims from around the world arrive in Saudi Arabia and perform a series of elaborate rites which take place during five days of Dh'l-Hijjah, the 12th month of the Islamic calendar. Hajj begins with a visit to the Ka'bah - a the cuboid structure that is the most sacred sight in Islam - at the Masjid al-Haram mosque and culminates on the Plain of Arafat a short distance away.

Pilgrimage to Mecca is one of five Pillars of Islam and Muslims wherever they are must perform it at least once in their lifetimes, if they are able.

The most iconic of the artworks associated with the Hajj are the textiles offered to the Ka'abah. These comprised a number of different elements, including an overall covering (kiswah), a belt (hizam), the door curtain (sitarah) and the interior textiles. These were traditionally produced by master artisans at the Dar-al Kiswah, an artistic workshop in Egypt dedicated to producing textiles for Mecca until 1926, when a factory that continues the age-old tradition alongside modern technology was opened by King Abdul-Aziz in Mecca.

These textiles, presented to the Ka‘bah and to the Prophet’s Mosque by whoever had sovereignty over the Holy Places, were mostly made in Egypt. They were sent to Mecca on a yearly basis with the caravan of pilgrims.

These caravans, which were described as ‘cities on the move’, set out from Damascus and Baghdad as well as Cairo, and included pilgrims from much further afield.

However, it was the caravan from Cairo which ignited the imagination of so many European observers: ‘Seven thousand souls on foot, on horseback, in litters, or bestriding the splendid camels of Syria’, explorer and polymath Richard Burton observed.

The head of the caravan, the Amir al-Hajj was the official in charge of the pilgrims and their safety and along with him was a generous retinue, including judges, bakers and vets. On the way there were caravansaries and watering holes which would provide the travellers with much needed refreshment, rest, safety from attack and shelter from heat.

From the 13th century until the mid-20th century, the Egyptian caravan was demarcated with the Mahmal: a wooden palanquin covered with beautifully decorated textile which balanced upon an equally decorated (and pampered) camel. As well as being a beacon of colour and a symbol of anticipated blessings, the Mahmal was primarily a symbol of political sovereignty.

First the Mamluks and later the Ottoman Sultans sent a Mahmal to accompany the new kiswah and emphasise their role as sovereigns and protectors of the two Holy Sanctuaries.

The Mahmal was paraded through the streets of Cairo with the textiles that were being sent to Mecca, before leaving the city with great pomp and celebration; well-wishers would touch it to obtain blessings, whilst others would revel in the sight itself. The Mahmal then would formally accompany the pilgrims along the perilous journey which lay ahead.

A second Mahmal accompanied the pilgrim caravan travelling from Damascus. Unlike the kiswah, the Mahmal was not renewed every year, but it was repaired and reused over a number of years. Therefore, very few have survived and the Khalili Collections is fortunate enough to be the custodian of seven of them.

What new sports were introduced in the 1912 Olympic Games?

Introducing women's swimming & diving at the Olympic Games

The first photo finish at the Olympic Games

Japan's debut in the Olympic Games

The first decathlon and pentathlon at the Olympic Games

The only Tug of War at the Olympic Games

What happened at the 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm, Sweden?

As Japan prepares to host the Olympic Games, let's take a look back to the Olympic Games when Japan first took part - the 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm, Sweden.

28 nations and 2,408 competitors, including 48 women, competed in 102 events in 14 sports.

The 1912 Olympic Games were the fifth games of the modern era, introducing many sports and other features to the competition.

In the early Olympic Games, a very small number of female athletes took part in limited sports. It wasn't until the1920 Olympic Games in Antwerpthat women officially took part. In 1912, swimming and diving competitions were introduced for women.

There was just one diving competition (a 10-metre platform event). Sweden's Greta Johansson and Lisa Regnell took gold and silver. Except for British Isabelle White who took bronze, all the remaining finalists were from Sweden. Greta Johansson was Sweden's first female Olympic champion.

In swimming, 100 metre freestyle and 400 metre team relay competitions took place.

In the 100 metres, AustraliansFanny Durackand Mina Wylie won gold and silver, with Jennie Fletcher of Great Britain coming third.

In the relay race, only four teams took part. The team from Great Britain won, with Germany second and Austria third.

New equipment for recording times and the ends of races were used for the first time in Stockholm. Camera equipment was used to determine results at the end of the men's 1500 metres race.

Arnold Jackson from Great Britain won by only 0.1 second, followed by Americans Abel Kiviat and Norm Taber who finished side by side. The photo equipment determined that Kiviat was slightly ahead.

At the time, the race was known as 'the greatest race ever run'.

Japan's participation in the games was the first from an Asian nation.

One Japanese athlete caused a stir in Stockholm by going missing.

Seen here in this photograph (2nd from right), Kanakuri Shizo, was a marathon runner. During the race, he suffered from heatstroke and lost consciousness.

A farming family helped him, bringing him to a party that was taking place on the marathon route so he could drink something and recuperate. He then caught a train back to Stockholm and left the country the next day, without notifying the race officials.

Decathlon and pentathlon were competed in for the first time in Stockholm.

Both events were won by Jim Thorpe, who was the first Native American to win a gold medal for theUnited States.

However, he lost his Olympic titles after it was discovered that he had been paid for playing semi-professional baseball before competing in the Olympics, thus violating the amateurism rules that were then in place.

In 1983, 30 years after his death, the International Olympic Committee restored his Olympic medals.

The Tug of War competition was another notable event - as only one match took place.

The team from Great Britian were due to play a team from Bohemia who could not be found. The same happened in the other semi-final, in which a team from Sweden was due to play a team from Austria.

Great Britain and Sweden got a bye to the final, where they played withSwedenwinning.

Sport competitions in the 1920s and 1930s

The sporting championships we enjoy now have long, historical roots. The modern Olympic Games were inspired by the Olympics of ancient Greece, reviving and valorising competitions from a time before the industrial and modern world.

In Ireland, the Tailteann Games can be seen to follow a similar path, reviving an ancient sporting tradition in modern times.

The Tailteann Games were a sport championships for Irish people or those with Irish ancestry. They were held across Ireland in 1924, 1928 and 1932. In these years, Ireland had just won its independence. The Tailteann Games were seen as a way to establish the new Irish state, reviving an ancient sporting custom.

In Bronze Age Ireland, large sporting gatherings known asfuneral gameswere held. These were athletic competitions held to honour a recently deceased person.

The name Tailteann derives from one such event: the Aonach Tailteann (the Tailtin Fair) held in the townload of Teltown in County Meath.

According to the Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland, the fair was established by the legendary king Lugh Lámhfhada (reigned 1849 to 1809 BC) in honour of his foster-mother, Tailtiu.

Sport was an important aspect of Irish nationalism in the early 20th century.

In the late 19th century, the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) was founded, promoting Irish sports such as hurling and Gaelic football as well as opposing 'English' sports such as soccer, rugby and cricket.

Launched to celebrate the independence of Ireland, the Games were first announced in 1921. Due to the Irish Civil War in 1922, the Games were postponed until August of 1924, a year after the war had finished.

In 1924 and 1928, the Tailteann Games were held shortly after the Summer Olympics, allowing athletes that had participated in Paris (1924) and Amsterdam (1928) to compete. Additionally, some Olympic athletes who were not of Irish ancestry were invited to compete to increase the competition and attract audiences.

The Games were held in various venues across Ireland, centred in Dublin at the GAA stadium Croke Park.

Events were held in athletics swimming and other aquatic sports, rowing, boxing, rounders, yachting, golf, tennis, gymnastics, wrestling, weight-lifting, billiards, chess, Gaelic football, hurling, handball and camogie (hurling for women).

There were events beyond sport too, with Irish dancing, music, painting, crafts, writing and storytelling competitions.

The 1932 Tailteann Games were less successful. The Olympic Games that year were held in Los Angeles, with the Dublin event not benefitting from an Olympics in a nearby country as previously. The Games duration was shortened from a fortnight down to a week.

Political changes in Ireland in the 1930s meant there was less will to continue with the Tailteann Games. In 1937, a committee was formed to explore the possibility of holding further games, but with the beginning of World War II, the games never took place again.

Thus, the Tailteann Games became a part of history, as much as the ancient Games which inspired them.

However, the name lives on in an annual cycling race held in Ireland since 1953, theRás Tailteann.

What is the history of football in London?

London is renowned as a home of football.

The city - which hosts the finals of the Euro 2020 Football Championships - is home to many of England's top-flight teams, with 13 professional clubs.

From Chelsea to Crystal Palace, Arsenal to Millwall, London's legacy as a city of football is secured.

This legacy stretches back to the beginnings of the modern game, with The Football Association - the world's oldest football association - formed there in 1863. In 1872, the first FA Cup Final match was held in London, with the majority of finals held there since, often at Wembley Stadium.

London's football history goes far beyond those professional clubs to a whole range of amateur teams and games.

To celebrate the UEFA EURO 2020 championships finally getting underway in 2021, the Museum of London have createdEleven, a film that highlights eleven personal stories of Londoners to create a contemporary London line-up and highlight the empowering nature of the 'beautiful game'.

The film captures a range of stories: from Globe Rangers in Walthamstow to Saint Matthews Project in Brixton, from the first Black Londoner to ever play football for England, Benjamin Odeje, to founder of Goal Diggers, Fleur Cousens, who created a team accessible to all women and non-binary people.

You can view the film if you are able to visit theMuseum of London, as well as below.

Football is, of course, more than the players and teams - it's all about the fans too. The West London club Brentford was founded in 1889 and more than a a century later continues to have a loyal following.

This video -Push Up Brentford! An Oral History of Brentford Football Club- features 23 in-depth oral history interviews with fans, former players and staff of the club.

The project focused - set up and run by educational charity digital:works - was recorded as the club was about to move from its Griffin Park ground, home to the club since 1904.

As well as being a home for football, thanks to centuries of migration, London too is home to many different nationalities and people with a diverse range of heritages.

The photographs below show fans of Colombia and Greece celebrating in London during recent World Cup and European Cup tournaments. (See also:Germany,Ghana,South Korea,Spain,Ukraine

1916 Olympic Games

1940 Olympic Games

1944 Olympic Games

Bidding to host

Cancellation, loss and postponement throughout the 20th century

The history of the modern Olympic Games is filled with dates, places and statistics - from host cities to world records.

But aside from the Olympic Games held so far since 1896, there have been a number of prospective games that have not come to reality.

Let's explore these histories that didn't happen, with objects and records that remain from these Olympic Games.

The Olympic Games have only been cancelled three times in the past (or 5 times if you count the Winter Olympics separately), and postponed once (in 2020). All the cancellations were as a result of world wars.

The 1916 Olympic Games were due to be held in Berlin, but was cancelled due to World War I.

Those games were due to include a winter sports week, which eventually led to first Winter Olympics which were held in 1924. The venue for the Games was to be the Deutsches Stadion which had been built in 1913.

Sanctions in the aftermath of World War I meant that the war's losing nations (and those blamed for starting it) were banned from competing or hosting the Games. Thus, Hungary, Germany, Austria, Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire were not part of the next Olympic Games.

Those games were eventually held in Antwerp in Belgium in 1920.

Berlin's opportunity to host the Games came again in 1936, when Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party used the Games as a massive propaganda exercise promoting their government and racist and antisemitic supremacy policies.

Those Olympics were held on the site of the previous Deutsches Stadion in a newly built Olympic Stadium.

The 1940 Olympic Games were originally due to be held in Tokyo, Japan. However, with the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Japan forfeited their hosting.

The International Olympic Committee then awarded the Games to Helsinki, Finland, which had been the runner up in the original bidding process.

World War II had broken out in September 1939, with the Games' cancellation coming soon afterwards.

As this was just a few months beforehand, Helsinki's preparations were at an advanced stage. Construction of the Helsinki Olympic stadium had begun in 1934 and was completed by 1938.

The 1940 Winter Olympic Games were originally scheduled to take place in Sapporo, Japan. With the outbreak of a war between Japan and China, Japan 'returned' the Games to the International Olympic Committee.

The IOC offered the Games to St Moritz in Switzerland but could not come to an agreement, so instead the games were given in early 1939 to Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany where the 1936 Winter Olympic Games had been held. The 1940 Games did not go ahead due to Germany's invasion of Poland and subsequent World War II.

The 1936 Olympic Games (both summer and winter) were controversial due to Nazi Germany's use of the games as a propaganda tool for their racist and anti-semitic beliefs, as can be seen in this poster for the cancelled 1940 Winter Games.

The 1944 Summer Olympics had been awarded to London, United Kingdom.

In spite of the war, the International Olympic Committee held events in 1944 to mark the 50th anniversary of its foundation. In the Woldenberg (Dobiegniew) Oflag II-C Prisoner of War camp, Polish prisoners of war were given permission by the German captors to stage an unofficial Olympics in July and August 1944.

Four years later, London went on to host the 1948 Olympic Games.

The 1944 Winter Olympics were due to be hosted in February in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, but they were cancelled in 1941.

Cortina d'Ampezzo eventually hosted the 1956 Winter Olympic Games.

The Olympics' sporting competitions are mirrored by competitions years before to host the Olympic Games. In more recent years, a number of German cities have entered the competition. Though none have been successful, artefacts and memorabilia testify to their bids, as well as to the opposition to them.

Berlin bid to host the 2000 Olympic Games which eventually were awarded to Sydney, Australia.

A number of German cities prepared to bid for the 2012 Olympic Games, with Leipzig being selected as an applicant city. London was the eventual host of the 2012 Games.

In 2020, the Olympic Games once again faced cancellation due to the Coronavirus pandemic. Instead, the event was postponed to 2021 - showing that global events impact on the Olympic Games in the 21st century as they did in the 20th century.

A history of more than 500 years of slavery of Roma population on the territory of Romania.

In this blog, Romanian journalist Iulia Hau outlines the history of Roma slavery in Romania.

How the Roma population ended up in the area we now call Romania is still not quite clear.

The main hypothesis is that they left the Punjab region of Northern India either as nomads or victims of unfavourable circumstances, such as war or natural disaster. Some theories state that the Roma population arrived in the Principality of Wallachia (the southern part of today’s Romania) as free people, but they were soon enslaved by the princes of Wallachia and Moldavia, who needed a workforce.

It's been said that they also brought valuable crafting skills and items with them, such as Indian ironworks, and that they were talented musicians. The first evidence of their presence in contemporary Romania comes from the 13th century, through a document that testifies to a gift. This gift came in the form of forty Roma families, donated to a monastery by the prince of Wallachia.

In Romania, they are known asțigani, a profoundly derogatory term which has its roots in the old Greek termAthiganoi- translated as 'untouchable, pagan, impure', giving them the status of a heretical sect. Upon arrival in the Byzantine Empire, Roma were considered members of this sect, and the term turned into a general one for any type of conduct or belief that deviated from institutionalized Christian norms. On the other hand, the English termgypsy, together with the Spanishgitanos, emerged from a mistake by Europeans who believed Roma had come from Egypt.

For almost five centuries, their slave labour resulted in huge earnings for their masters: landowers, the feudal aristocracy and the Orthodox Church. Romani people's status was that of subjugated people, the absolute property of their masters: their masters' personality, faith and habits dictated their whole existence.

After 1500, even though the number of slaves decreased dramatically in Catholic and Protestant Europe - as slaves were transferred to overseas colonies to work - slavery flourished in Romanian Principalities. 'In the 16th, 17th, and 18th century we were probably the only country in Europe which had a class of people with this label of slave or bondsman', states Professor doctor Constantin Bălăceanu Stolnici.

Roma bondsmen were subjected to atrocious treatment.

For five centuries, they were denied the status of human being. Among the cruellest punishments was that of wearing a collar fitted with iron spikes on the inside that prevented the wearer from lying down to rest.

Most of the writing we have about this topic comes from foreigners travelers, staggered by this behaviour.

The squires are their absolute masters. They sell or kill them like cattle, at their sole discretion. Their children are born slaves with no distinction on sex

Jean Louis Parrant, who was in Moldavia during the French revolution, asks himself: 'What can be said about this numerous miserable flock of beings (because they can’t be otherwise described) that are called gypsies and are lost for the humanity, placed on the same level with the cattle of burden and often treated even worse by the their barbaric master whose revolting (so-called) property they are?'

Mihail Kogălniceanu, a former Romanian politician who played a significant role in the abolition of slavery, remembers growing up in a provincial Romanian town and seeing people 'being with hands and feet enchained, with iron circles around their forehead or metal collar around their neck. Bloody whips and other punishments such as starvation, hanging over a burning fire, the detention barrack and the forcing to stay naked in snow or in the frozen water of a river - this is the treatment applied to the miserable gypsies.'

Legislative texts, referring to them under a double denomination - gypsies or bondsmen -statedthat they were born slaves; that every child born from a slave mother was a slave; that their masters had power of life and death over them; that each owner had the right to sell or offer his slaves; and that every masterless gypsy is propriety of the state. The list goes on...

Once the modern concept of property was established in the collective mentality, Romanian noblemen felt entitled to buy and sell bondsmen, as any other commodity, and so the Roma became comparable with any valuable object. They were given as dowry at weddings or offered to monasteries in exchange for the mentioning of their former masters’ name during mass.

Bondsmen auctions, similar to public markets, were kept track of in court records and announced in newspapers. There are a great many documents that testify these slave transactions.

In 1600, a gypsy fit for work was worth the same as a horse. In 1682, a gypsy woman was worth two mares with foals. In 1760, three gypsies were worth the same as a house, and in 1814, Snagov Monastery was selling a gypsy for the price of four buffalo. There were also cases when gypsies were sold according to their weight, exchanged for honey barrels, pawned off, or offered as presents.

The abolishment of Roma slavery began with young artistocratic Romanians leaving to study in Western Europe. Upon returning home, they gave voice to progressive ideas denouncing slavery.

At the same time, Western Europe, and France especially, exerted considerable pressure on the newly formed Romanian state regarding the abolition of slavery.In the middle of the 19th century, there were half a million slaves on Romanian territory: 7% of the population.

Unfortunately, until now, Roma slavery has not been yet included in most history school books, and there are still very few Romanians who are aware of this historical reality.

At the moment, Roma people represent the second most widely-spread ethnic minority and the most vulnerable ethnic group in Romania. Even though the process of Roma integration began more than 15 years ago, the results leave much to be desired. Tackling discrimination of Roma people is still more of an empty promise than palpable reality.

Placido Zuloaga

Inspired by Nasrid design

The Nasrid dynasty was the last Muslim dynasty in the Iberian Peninsula, ruling the Emirate of Granada from 1230 until 1492. Today, the most visible evidence of the Nasrid dynasty is the Alhambra palace complex which has influenced generations of creators

The most notable example of Nasrid inspiration in the 19th century was to be found in Spain itself – namely in the art and craft of Spanish damascene metalwork.

This highly specialised art form involved the decoration of oxidised iron or tempered steel with gold, silver and occasionally copper. The damascener would heat an iron object, cut lines into it, then lay fine silver and gold wire over this striated surface using a variety of manual punches. Other stages of the process would include shading (sombreado) where fine details would be accomplished, and beading (perleado) where a band or border would be introduced featuring small ‘beads’ made from winding the fine silver wire. The results were breath-taking.

The undisputed master of this art form was Placido Zuloaga. He came from the most distinguished family of artists and artisans in Eibar – his grandfather was Chief Royal Armourer and his father Eusebio was himself Lieutenant Armourer and Honorary Gunmaker to Queen Isabel II and won medals at the 1851 World's Fair in London.

But it was Plácido who perfected the art, took it to new heights, thereby transforming Eibar into the European epicentre for damascene metalwork. 
Initially commissioned by Queen Isabella, following her death, Zuloaga reached out to British patron Lord Alfred Morrison, who would go on to commission masterpieces such as the Fonthill Casket.

In addition to holding the world’s most comprehensive collection of Islamic art and artefacts, the Khalili Collections also holds the most significant collection of Spanish Damascene metalwork by Zuloaga and other masters in Toledo. This allows for an unprecedented opportunity to see the nature and extent of the influence of one on the other.

Firstly, the sheer intricacy of Spanish damascening in itself mirrors that demonstrated by Nasrid artisans some five centuries before. The tradition of immaculate attention to detail and the flawless application of symmetry were most certainly continued by the damasceners.

Moreover, ornamental elements from Islamic art and particularly Nasrid art such as particular geometric (the eight-point star) and vegetal (ataurique) motifs are also to be found in abundance in works coming out of Eibar and Toledo.

Perhaps the most vivid connection is the appearance on so many of the damascene masterpieces of the Nasrid mottowa la ghaliba illa Allah‘Only God is the Victorious’ in Arabic script, together with its official shield. Not only was this a nod to the Islamic tradition in Spanish history, but also an appreciation of the universal beauty of the Arabic calligraphic script. Whether or not the motivations were secular or spiritual is not known, but it certainly opens up an interesting narrative for discussion on interfaith relations in the history of Spain.

There are also ornamental designs specific to Alhambra that clearly inspired Zuloaga, most obviously visible in his pair of urns (also commissioned by Morrison) that almost identically follow the designs of the famous Alhambra Vases. The large wing-like handles, the monumental size (over a metre tall), the Islamic motifs and the distribution of the damascene ornament of the Zuloaga urns all show how familiar he was with the Alhambra counterparts. Moreover, his use of Arabesques in damascening would inspire other damasceners from Toledo to follow suit.

Plácido Zuloaga became one of Spain’s great modern masters, who in producing so many works of cultural significance, became a national treasure in his own right. By the time of his death in 1910 at the age of 76, he had won many honours, including Knight Commander of the Order of Isabel the Catholic and Knight of the Order of Charles III. But his most unique contribution is how he leveraged Spain’s Islamic cultural heritage to take the art of damascening to a level never before – and never since – achieved.

Centuries of emigration

Emigration waves in the 20th century

Economic factors

Career opportunities

Out in the world

A century of change and continuity

Century of change and continuity

As with so many countries, Ireland ended the 20th century a different country to how it began - it was a true century of change.

Throughout this time, migration was a constant part of Irish society, with several, specific and successive waves when significant proportions of its population moved abroad in search of new lives.

Through a number of collections shared on Europeana, as well as through stories shared during ourEuropeana Migrationcampaign, we can hear the memories and experiences of some of those that emigrated from Ireland in the 20th century.

For centuries, Ireland's history has been shaped by migration - from Irish missionaries leaving the island to spread their religion as early as the 6th century, to those escaping the poverty and disease of the Irish Famine in the 1840s and 1850s.

Migration has become part of Ireland's culture, with those leaving most often moving to other English-speaking countries, like the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, Canada.

In the 20th century, Ireland gained its independence from the United Kingdom. Throughout the decades following that 1921 milestone, there was always migration - but two decades, in particular, stand out.

The 1950s saw Ireland's economy severely depressed.

Agriculture - where many were traditionally employed - was in decline, with the Irish government failing to encourage other industries to fill the gap. This led to high unemployment rates, with around half a million Irish people (from an overall population of around 3 million) emigrating throughout the decade. Many of these were young people from rural areas, aware that the only way to secure their future was to leave Ireland.

During the 1960s and 1970s, emigration decreased somewhat, as Ireland's economy improved and the country joined the EEC in 1973. However, by the 1980s, emigration had once again increased. In this decade, the Irish (and global) economy contracted. As in the 1950s, many of those emigrating were young - but, in contrast to the earlier decade, many were educated and left Ireland in search of better opportunities.

In this interview, one woman describes her memories of emigrating to the United Kingdom and later to the United States. She describes leaving Ireland in the 1960s and 1990s due to economic reasons. The recordings stem from group interviews about memories from childhood and adolescence by the Irish Qualitative Data Archive.

This man describes his experiences as a twentysomething in the 1950s moving to Chicago. He worked there as a telephone salesperson.

In this story, shared at Europeana Migration collection day event atThe Hunt Museum, Limerick, James describes his experiences in New York in the 1990s. He remembers the peculiar Irish emigration phenomen 'The American Wake': a name given to a party or ceremony that was organised when someone moved to the United States - a farewell commemoration.

In this story, shared at an event atEPIC The Irish Emigration Museum, Orla describes her and her husband’s experiences emigrating to London in the 1970s for better career opportunities, along with the wedding gifts they brought with them - an object symbolising their migration.

In this interview, a woman describes her experiences as a missionary teaching at a boarding school in Nigeria in the 1960s.

When we think of career-driven migration, perhaps actors are not the first people that come to mind. This documentary explores the experiences of Irish actors working in London - both on stage and screen - in the early 1960s.

One of the most common emigration scenarios - for Irish women in particular - was to move to London to train and work as a nurse in the British National Health Service. In this interview - one of 100 recorded byUniversity College Cork’s Irish Women at Work Oral History Project- Elizabeth describes her experiences in the 1940s and beyond.

In this story, Ann describes her time training as a nurse in London in the 1950s. She described how there were 14 nurses in her class, all from Ireland except for one student from the Caribbean.

This bronze name-tag belongs to Michael, who moved from a small country village in County Kilkenny to London in the late 1950s to train as a nurse.'London in the 1950s was quite an anonymous place which was, in a way, a welcome thing after my upbringing in rural Ireland where everybody was aware of everything going on in everybody's life', he says.

Ireland in the 20th century was a conversative, Catholic country which did not treat its LGBTQ+ community well. They faced discrimination, violence, shame, silence and stigma.

Many LGBTQ+ people moved away from Ireland, in search of anonymity and more accepting societies and communities.

In 2021,EPIC The Irish Emigration Museumin Dublin hosted the exhibitionOut in the World, about the Irish LGBTQ+ diaspora. Learn more about this exhibition via the videos below.

Emigration is a phenomenon that is never solved nor complete. The desire to live elsewhere - whether through necessity or choice - is ever-present.

Ireland in the 1990s and at the beginning of the 21st century became a country that saw more immigration than emigration. But during the late 2000s and early 2010s, due to economic recession, it once again faced a  wave of emigration. In 2021, the nation commemorates a century of independence that was, in many ways, a century of change but from a migration point of view has seen the same pendulum going back and forth.

Exploring the archives of Commonwealth Games Scotland

In August 1930, the first British Empire Games was held in Hamilton, Canada.

It featured teams from 11 nations who competed in six sports (athletics, bowls, boxing, rowing, swimming and wrestling). Scotland sent a team of 19 athletes and won two gold medals in athletics and boxing.

In 2022, the 22nd staging of the competition, now called the Commonwealth Games, will be held in Birmingham, England. Today it is a major international multi-sport event for members of the Commonwealth, with 72 nations participating in next year's competition.

This year marks the 90th anniversary of the foundation ofCommonwealth Games Scotland.

The University of Stirling holds its archives, which tell the story of almost a century of international sporting participation and achievement. The core records of the organisation are enhanced by related collections of personal memorabilia from athletes and administrators who participated in the Games.

TheCommonwealth Gameshas a unique place in the Scottish sporting calendar.

For athletes in many sports, it is the only chance to represent their country at a major competition (as at many other events, including the Olympics, Scotland forms part of the team representing Great Britain). For others, it may also provide the highest level of competition they reach – a unique opportunity to challenge themselves against a selection of the best athletes in the world.

The United Kingdom sends 7 teams to the Games (England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey); other European participants are teams from Cyprus, Malta and Gibraltar.

The archive documents the experiences and achievements of our Scottish teams.

In the early years of the competition, one of the main challenges faced was the gruelling travel required to reach events held in Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

The archive includes a fascinating photograph album created by a team member in 1950 which documents the month-long journey by ocean liner to Auckland, New Zealand. The challenges of training on board ship are recorded as boxers, runners and even swimmers attempted to keep fit on deck! In the photograph below, Scottish boxer Hugh Riley trains on board the SS Tamora en route to the 1950 Commonwealth Games in Auckland, New Zealand. Riley went on to win gold in the Flyweight competition.

Scotland had to wait until 1970 to be selected as the host nation for competition. Edinburgh was chosen at the venue that year (and would go on to host the competition again in 1986). You can read more about the long road to hosting the Games on theUniversity of Stirling's archives blog.

The Games returned to Scotland in 2014 with Glasgow hosting the event.

Then, we shared our collections with visitors to the city viaHosts and Champions, a pop-up exhibition telling the story of Scotland's participation in the Commonwealth Games.

Following the 2014 Games, we developed it into a touring display which has since visited 20 venues across Scotland, demonstrating the wide public interest in our sporting heritage. The University Archives continues to work closely with Commonwealth Games Scotland to collect and promote their history and heritage. We look forward to adding another chapter to the story next year atBirmingham 2022.

Exploring the queer artistic legacy of GAN

Gösta Adrian-Nilsson was a Swedish modernist artist, better known by the acronym GAN. He was highly influential in  Swedish modernist art, flitting between Art Nouveau, Expressionism, Cubism, Futurism, Dadaism and Surrealism. How did GAN progress through this multitude of artistic styles, and how did he get his mysterious acronym GAN?

Born and raised in Lund, Gösta states in his diary that at a young age he first found out about his artistic and sexual interests through his brother's geography book. The geometrical shapes and patterns of the maps intrigued him almost as much as the variety of drawings of nude tattooed 'men of the Marquesas Islands' depicted in the book.

This duality of geometry and the male figure would feature heavily in Gösta's artwork throughout his life.

Gösta Adrian-Nilsson first publicly showed his artworks at an exhibition at Lund University Museum in 1907, as well as in a publication of his poems. He presented his work under the acronym 'GAN' - a name he would continue to use for the rest of his career. In the first years of Gösta's artistic development, he stuck mainly to the Art Nouveau style - he had become interested in this through his fascination with Oscar Wilde and Aubrey Beardsley. His early works include drawings of Oscar Wilde, depictions of nude men lovingly holding hands and accentuated luscious lips, which, in his diaries, GAN described as a potent erotic symbol.

In 1910 GAN went to study in Copenhagen, learning more about post-impressionist art styles. The most radical influences on his artistic style came from his time in Berlin, where he arrived in January 1913.

GAN befriended the artists leading theDer Sturmmovement and art gallery. He experienced and learned from the art of Kandinsky, Franz Marc, and Picasso. Recurring motifs started to be seen in his work at this time: a love for strong masculine forms - sportsmen, soldiers and workers - reflecting modern technology and industrialisation.

At the time, GAN's partner was Karl Edvard Holmström, a metal worker who GAN had met in Lund in 1908. Karl and Gösta had moved to Berlin together and lived happily together until the end of 1913, when Karl got recalled to work in an armaments factory in Sweden.

In the summer of 1914, at the start of World War I, GAN received news that Karl had suddenly died of pneumonia. Devastated, Gösta returned to Lund and soon after moved to Stockholm. GAN's work in Stockholm features depictions of industrial progress, but focuses more and more on paintings of sailors, reflecting his frequent late-night cruising activities at the Stockholm docks.

Art historian dr. Richard G. Mann writes about the artwork below:

a pen and crayon drawing entitled Två Sjöjmän på Berns (Two Sailors at
Berns) depicts muscular seamen, who clearly seem to be waiting for clients at the Berns Café, well known as a homosexual meeting place. Seated at a table in provocative poses, the two smoking men gaze intently in opposite directions. The widespread legs of the foreground sailor emphasizes his bulging crotch area. The inscription "Berns 18/10 16" suggests that GAN may have intended the drawing as a record of his observations at the café on a particular date.

Richard G. Mann, the glbtq Archive, 2013.

In 1918, GAN mounted a full exhibition called 'Sjömanskompositioner' (Sailor Compositions) in Stockholm. The exhibition was dedicated to his new partner, Edvin Andersson who was a sailor in the Swedish army.

GAN's wholly original mix of Cubist and Futurist styles was not well received by art critics or the public. Most critics deemed his work too 'chaotic'; others condemned his homoerotic subject matter. In that time, homosexuality was illegal and taboo in Sweden, leading to GAN and his work being ostracised by the Swedish public and art scene.

Even though the Swedish press condemned GAN for his homosexuality and artworks, GAN could count on critical acclaim in progressive artist and intellectual circles. From 1920 to 1925 he lived in Paris, exploring new mediums inspired by the Dadaist movement.

GAN's artworks fostered the development of geometric abstraction in Scandinavian art, with younger Swedish artists being deeply influenced by his modernism. Even though his influence was clearly felt and appreciated by Swedish artists, critics continued to ridicule GAN when he introduced Surrealist art into Sweden after returning from France.

Gösta spent the last decades of his life soured by under-appreciation, living in bitter voluntary isolation from 1940 onwards, despite continued encouragement by his partner Edvin. GAN died in Stockholm in 1965.

Only in the past few decades has GAN's art been appreciated for its impact on Swedish modernism. He is now considered one of the most important pioneers of Swedish modern art. He also boldly stood at the forefront of queer visual expression, publicly exhibiting his art in defiance of homophobia.

1: Did robots kill the artisan star?

2: Consumerism and Advertising

3: From Haute Couture to fashion culture

The rise of consumerism in the 20th century

Throughout the 20th Century almost every facet of society changed dramatically to result in the global capitalist economy of today. But how did we get here?

In this three-part vlog series, we’re diving into 20th-century history to find out how changes in production processes, consumer patterns and advertising strategies awoke the little hoarder inside of us. How has technological innovation fundamentally changed our production cycle? How did we get to this level of globalisation where we can consume products from all over the world? Were brands always as important and powerful as they are now? And what created the shift from functional fashion over haute couture to the disposable fast fashion culture we're in today?

Our first episode focuses on technology, transport, logistics, and the digital revolution. Dive into the whirlwind of change and innovation that is the 20th Century in this first episode:

Episode 2 is a sneak peek into the history of branding and advertisement, and how consumerism became the new religion.

Episode 3 is a sneak peek into the history of fashion in the 20th Century - from functional fashion wear to haute couture... to fast fashion?

Sport story of a shoe factory in Martfű

The tiny village of Martfű has made a big name for itself as the capital of Hungarian shoes.

Czech-born Jan Antonin Baťa (who also gave his name to the shoe brand Bata) saw the potential in this little place along the river Tisza and bought a site for his factory in 1939. He started producing shoes three years later under the name 'Cikta Inc'.

Production started during World War II and did not stop, despite the shoe industry struggling with shortages that saw rubber soles replaced by wood for a while.

In 1949, the factory was nationalised and took on a new name - 'Tisza Shoe Factory National Company'. In the 1950s and 1960s, it only sold to customers in Hungary but later exported to the CMEA market (the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance - an economic organisation comprising Eastern Bloc countries and some other socialist states).

Martfű and its shoe factory became iconic. So much so that Valentina Tereshkova, the first female astronaut, visited the plant in 1965. The photograph below shows Tereshkova with the factory director István Grosz. The labourers of the shoe factory chose her as a role model and formed a brigade on 16 April 1965.

In the 1970s, Tisza developed a sports shoe - the Tisza shoe - which became a huge success among young people. In 1971, the 'T' logo was born and the cult of the brand began. Tisza shoes were nicknamed the 'Adidas of the steppe', an appropriate name as Adidas were also made in the factory from the 1970s.

Tisza was the dominant player in the Hungarian domestic market for a long time - the first Adidas store only opening in Budapest in 1987. And while the popularity of Adidas was based on its western origin (and the difficulty in getting hold of a pair), Tisza shoes were popular mass products.

The factory continued making sport shoes until the 1990s. Then, they switched to manufacturing everyday shoes (known as street shoes), but the sporty Tisza shoe began being made again in 2003, taking advantage of both retro nostalgia and its own unique style.

In 1942, a sports association called Cikta Levente SE was opened in Martfű.

It struggled to operate due to the hardships of World War II, but its teams achieved good results in football and handball. In 1945, it was re-established as the Workers' Sports Association and encouraged employees to participate in mass sporting activities and competitions.

Hundreds took part in the Kilián physical education movement - this was a sports policy movement in schools, factories, offices. The point was to get as many people to play sports as possible, but here the goal was not to promote professional sports, but mass sports. In 1966 alone, 2,200 people took part in various sporting events.

The photograph above shows a race with the sloganFut a Tisza cipő- Tisza shoes are running.

This sports movement was modelled on Soviet sports, with an emphasis on large numbers taking part and campaigns to encourage participation. Looking through the sports results of contemporary newspapers reveals how many people performed outstandingly under the name of the Tisza Shoe Factory.

From the 1960s to the present day, there have been a number of achievements that both athletes and city residents can be proud of.

The Workers' Sports Association of the Tisza Shoe Factory, which dates back decades, was undoubtedly one of the most successful clubs in Hungary, promoting both mass sports and the proper integration of sport into the working world.

Greek and Latin in the beautiful game

The sport we enjoy today has classical roots. In this blog, Classics teacher Gary Vos explores links between football and antiquity.

The modern marathon was unwittingly instituted by an ill-fated messenger who ran to Athens all the way from the site of the Battle of Marathon (490 BC) to tell the Athenians of the Greek victory. After relating the good news, he dropped dead.

But what are the classical roots of football, the world’s most popular sport?
What we understand as football today did not exist in antiquity, but that did not stop one German classicist football aficionado.

In the most venerable encyclopaedia on all matters ancient, affectionately known asDer neue Pauly,  Mischa Meier authored and published a spoof entry on the Greek game of ἀποπουδοβαλία (apopudobalia) or, in Latin,lusus pedifollis.

This was meant to attribute the game's invention to anyone but the English. His elaborate joke prompted a tongue-in-cheek exchange of arguments for and against the existence of an ancient equivalent to modern football in the Petronian Society Newsletter, which true to its eponym need not be taken entirely at face-value. You can read afacsimile of the 'theory' and the responses(via the Wayback Machine).

Classical names

The above does not mean that there is no classical football heritage at all.

An impressive number of football clubs are named after Greek and Roman heroes, notions, places, and events. The Italian football teamJuventusis probably the most famous example. Its name stems from the Latin wordiuventusmeaning 'youth' (an ironic contrast with its nicknameLa Vecchia Signorawhich means The Old Lady).

Another Italian club,Hellas Veronatakes its name fromHellas, the Greek name for Greece. The club was founded by students of Greek and Latin at a local high school, Liceo Maffei (which was itself named after Verona'sforemost antiquarian).

In the Netherlands, one can compareExcelsior Rotterdam(‘higher, loftier’, from the Latinexcelsus).

Similarly, in Slavic countries, there are many clubs called 'Spartak'. These are not named after the Greek place Sparta (which has otherwise lent its name to various teams), but in tribute to Spartacus, the Greek gladiator who raised an army of slaves who rebelled against their Roman overlords. In similar ways, in the Soviet age, these teams symbolised a 'rebellion' of the workers against an elite (capitalist, state-sponsored, or otherwise).

Similarly, in the Netherlands,AFC Ajaxis named after a Greek hero who fought in the Trojan war. There were two Ajaxes in that war: one, the son of Telamon, was the king of Salamis; the other, the son of Oileus, the king of Locris. To which does the club refer?

Most people think it is the former, that Ajax being the greatest hero after Achilles (although experts claim it’s the latter Ajax, an ‘offender of the gods’ who raped the Trojan priestess Cassandra).

The former sounds like the safer choice for an eponymous hero, until one remembers his ignominious end, throwing himself onto his own sword after he has lost the battle for Achilles' armor, as immortalised inSophocles' tragedy.

The club logo is a further source of confusion: the abstracted form is modelled after the bust depicted below - a popular subject amongengravers,painters, andsculptorsexploring classical themes -  which many art-historians now identify as Menelaus.

The Turkish teamFenerbahçe’s name is wonderful: it is named after one of Istanbul’s quarters with a famous lighthouse. Its name is a compound of Greek (fener- < Gr.φανάρι(ον),phanari(on), ‘beacon, lighthouse’) and Persian (-bahçe<bagche, ‘little garden’), reflecting Istanbul's unique history between Europe and Asia. Fenerbahçe is thus 'Lighthouse Little Garden FC'.

Player names can also be classically inspired, such as the BrazilianJúlio César, who ironically, given that he shares his name with the aggressive general Julius Caesar, signed with Italian side Juventus as a defender in 1990.

Other examples include Brazilian midfielderSócrates, the inventor of the no-look back heel pass. He was nicknamed Doctor Socrates by his teammates because he, like theAthenian philosopher(could Sócrates' famous beard be a tribute?), was always burying his nose in books and earned a medical degree. (A persistent but untrue story claims he studied at University College Dublin, Ireland.)

Virgil van Dijk, Liverpool's Dutch central defender, shares his name with the Roman poet Vergil/Virgil (the spelling is debated), who gave Rome its foundational epic, theAeneid.

The names of these players – from Brazil and Breda, The Netherlands but with a Surinamese heritage – betray a colonial influence. Since this is now finally on the agenda of international football, it is worthwhile to recognise these Classical influences for what they are and the history behind them. In order to do so, however, we need to be willing and able to access each other's cultural heritages.

We should not forget that the trophy lifted by the winning team ultimately derives from Graeco-Roman ritual: the winning army would erect aτρόπαιον / tropaeumto commemorate their victory over their opponents. A 'Eurocentric' view of history runs through the discipline of Classics and sport: Romans versus the Mediterranean, Greeks versus Persians, West versus East - 'us' versus 'them'.

Just as the civilisations of Greece and Rome were firmly embedded within the wider world and not self-contained institutions, football transcends the realm of sport alone and is a major social, economical and political factor (as the current furore about the World Cup in Qatar shows).

It is high time that narratives of segregation and conquest give way to a 'we' collectively and inclusively - after all, it takes two teams to play, and a league to keep things interesting.

World Hairdressing Championships

Genoa Pesto World Championships

Logging and chainsaw championships

Parachute & skydiving championships

Exploring competitions with regional and cultural inspirations

We tend to think of sporting championships as involving athletic efforts. Running,football, hockey andswimmingall have championships - both national European and International.

What about other activities where people can compete against each other to create the biggest or best or do something the fastest?

Let's explore some more unusual championships which have been held around Europe.

Cutting hair is an artform, mixing technique, fashion and style. The World Hairdressing Championships make it a sport.

In 1962, the championships were held inAmsterdam- the 7th World Championship for women's and men's hairdressers. This video reports from the event, including an interview with the Dutch champion Mrs Broekhuizen.

The photograph below shows Raymond Bessone, a winner of an International Hairdressing Contest held inLondonin January 1932.

The Pesto World Championships have been held in Genoa, Italy at the Palazzo Ducale since 2007. Organised by PalatiFini, a cultural and gastronomic association, the competition aims to preserve and protect culinary traditions.

In the competition, 100 competitors from all over the world prepare Genovese Pesto exclusively with a pestle and mortar, using only traditional, authentic and genuine ingredients.

Scandinavian and Nordic countries are lands of forests.Logging has been an important part of industrythere, so it may not come as a surprise that logging and chainsaw use has become a sport.

TheWorld Logging Championshiphas been held in European countries since the 1970s, withSwedenandDenmarkhosting the competition once,Finlandhosting 3 times andNorway5 times.

Whereas once these championships involved sawing by hand, the development of motorised chainsaws brought a new form of competition.

These photographs shows four women - Antonina Chmielarczyk, Maria Żak, Wanda Szteyn and Anna Franke - taking part in the second Parachute Championships ofPoland, held in Białystok in September 1955 and another competition in Poznań in 1956.

The Polish parachuting championships have been held since 1954 at locations across Poland, with many of these women winning medals.

In 1958, at the Parachute World Championships in Bratislava, Anna Franke won the title of vice-champion of the world, and the Polish women's team took 2nd place in the team competition.

The visual and decorative art produced by the Nasrids within and around the Alhambra complex has influenced European artists in ways that are only now beginning to be understood

The Art of the Nasrids

The Alhambra Palace, standing majestically on the Iberian Peninsula, is one of the crowning artistic achievements of Islamic civilization. Built during the Nasrid dynasty – the last Islamic dynasty in Spain (1230-1492) – this architectural masterpiece has inspired generations of thinkers and creators worldwide. Its alluring muqarnas, calligraphic inscriptions, horseshoe archways and paradisal gardens have continued to captivate tourists and travellers for centuries.

Yet what few draw attention to is the visual and decorative art produced by the Nasrids within and around the Alhambra complex – art that has influenced European artists in ways that are only now beginning to be understood.

The Khalili Collections holds what is widely considered to be the world’s most comprehensive collection of Islamic art and artefacts, spanning 1400 years across all geographic areas of Islamic history and including a wide variety of mediums and artistic expression. Within the Khalili Collections, art relating to the Nasrid period allows us the unique opportunity to shed further light on this enchanting yet enigmatic society – namely its philosophical worldview, spiritual motivations and creative tendencies.

The Collection educates us about a wide variety of Nasrid art forms ranging from coins, plasterwork and jewellery to ceramics, metalwork, textiles and illuminated Qurans.

Nasrid art was influenced by the cultural and geographical diversity of Islamic civilisation. As such, a unique synthesis of vegetal, geometric and calligraphic motifs is what characterises its creative output, regardless of medium. Moreover the common inclusion of the Nasrid mottowa la ghaliba illa Allahor ‘Only God is the Victorious’ became a trademark of the art of this period. Inscriptions from the Quran, notable poetry and simple expressions such asal-afiyahor ‘Good Health’ are also expressed through exquisite kufic and naskh calligraphy.

Whilst the Umayyad art that preceded it was characterised by a flamboyant opulence, Nasrid art favoured a more subtle approach. Natural materials and techniques such as plaster, ceramics ovens and natural pigments produced a delicate yet profound beauty. The sheer variety of works produced became exemplary of the creative and spiritual pluralism of Nasrid society.

Influence on Modern European Art

The Nasrid dynasty fell to the Catholic armies of Spain in the late 15th century, yet much of its art and architecture was preserved through the centuries. The European Romanticism movement of the 18th century revived interest in Alhambra, and by the 19th century saw a ‘neo-Alhambraism’ develop following the Great Exhibition of 1851 when European collectors such and Jean Charles Davillier began to express a remarkable fascination with art and artefacts from that period, and in 1856 when Owen Jones published his seminal Grammar of Ornament which popularised Nasrid design. In turn, Nasrid art began to captivate artists across Europe including the likes of Matisse, Morris and Escher.  The term ‘Alhambrismo’ was conceived to describe a genre that generated hundreds of paintings across Europe.

This blog is part of a two series on Nasrid art and its influence on European art.  Look out for the next blog on how the art of Alhambra inspired Spanish metal worker and sculptor Plácido Zuloaga.

Under the sea, more than 228,000 species live - vast oceans of biodiversity. In this blog, we dive underwater to explore how some species have adapted for survival.

Different species have survival mechanisms in place to protect their homes and feeding grounds, leading to interesting symbiotic relationships.

Coral reefs are home to at least 25% of underwater species. They are commonly found in tropical waters and at shallow depths.

Coral reefs protect and support themselves by secreting hard carbonate external skeleton. They provide complex and diverse habitats that support a variety of other organisms. There may perhaps be as much as 8,000 species of fish residing within the ecosystems of coral reefs around the world.

Corals provide shelter and food for herbivorous fish and, in return, these fish protect corals from seaweeds that can damage and kill corals.

Corals can send out chemical signals when under attack by toxic seaweeds that alert fish like gobies to come and feast. The goby fish themselves develop toxins from eating the seaweed thus becoming less desirable prey.

Anemone fish are amongst those who've adapted to be unaffected by the sea anemone's stinging cells. The fish use the anemones as their home, being protected from other predators, while, on the other hand, the sea anemone uses faeces from the fish as nutrients.

The relationships between these underwater species are essential to their survival, each playing specific roles that benefit the other allowing for their ecosystem to continue functioning.

--------------------------------------------------

With increased awareness of climate change, more people are looking at how they can offset their carbon footprint by reflecting on what they consume, the clothes they buy, how they travel and much more.

One of the aspects that is becoming more prominent in these discussions are the actual places we live in - our homes - with the idea that these buildings can be designed or renovated to be sustainable.

According to Recycle Nation, 40-50 percent of waste in landfills is attributed to architecture. According to theUN environmental report 2020, carbon dioxide emissions from the building sector are the highest ever recorded, accounting for 38% of total global energy related CO2 emissions.

Sustainable architecture is about designing structures that create healthy environments to live in and minimises negative environmental impact, consumption of energy and human resources.

Sustainable architecture (also called green architecture or environmental architecture) as a modern view, is said to have risen in the 1960s with the rise of eco-awareness. The defiant younger generations of the time intensely questioning uncontrolled urban development and the look alike suburbs that were taking over.

In the early 20th century, American architect Frank Lloyd Wright (1867 – 1959) believed that buildings should not dominate their surroundings but rise out of a natural area. He spent most of his career shaping his ideas around ‘organic architecture’ that was responsive to the surrounding nature.

Scottish landscape architect Ian McHarg (1920-2001) wrote a book on ecological planning and design of communities in 1969 called ‘Design and Nature’, which to this day continues to be celebrated. He argued that the world should group its living centres together and disturb the natural world as little as possible.

Among the many architects around the world, Belgian architect Vincent Callebaut, British architect Norman Foster, Indian architect Chitra Vishwanath, and Tanzanian architect Victoria Heilman are among the many today shaping the world of architecture through designs that are energy efficient, ecological and responsive to current crises while inspiring and pushing for more to be done to foster symbiotic connections with nature.

Dutch city with the country's first bicycle path

The Netherlands is known globally as a country of cyclists. Cycling is part of every day life, as well as many Dutch sportspeople having won amateur and professional cycling races.

The Dutch obsession with cycling can be traced back to Utrecht, a city in the centre of the country.

In 1885, the Netherlands' first official cycling path opened in Utrecht on a street called Maliebaan.

At the time, a lack of proper paving meant that cycling was not possible everywhere - in fact, in many cases, cycling was not allowed on public roads.

Two years prior to the first cycling path, a group of cycling enthuasists set up the 'Algemene Nederlandsche Wielrijders-Bond' (the Royal Dutch Tourist Association).

On 1 July 1883, in the café Buitenlust (also on the Maliebaan), they founded the association with aims to promote recreational cycling. They publicised cycle paths, placed signposts and selected and recognised suitable hotels.

Since the end of the 19th century, the association has expanded beyond cycling to motorists, hikers, horse riders, motorcyclists, campers and more.

One of the 200 founding members of the ANWB was Englishman Charles Bingham. In in 1887, he was one of the founders of the city's first bicycle factory Simplex.

In the 1890s, the Dutch bicycle industry grew rapidly. In 1893, the Association of Dutch Bicycle Manufacturers was founded in Utrecht.

By 1911, the Dutch owned more bicycles per capita than any other country in Europe. The surging popularity of cycling - not only in Utrecht but across the Netherlands - saw many small bicycle factories established there.

In the 1970s and 1980s, mass protests by cyclists led to the city making deliberate politic decisions to reduce the impact of cars in the city centre.

Today, cycling is part of everyday life in Utrecht - there are an average of 125,000 in the city every day. 98% of the city's population own at least one bike, many own more. The city is home to the largest bike park in the world, which can house 12,500 bikes as well as Vredenburg, the busiest cycle path in the Netherlands.

Johnny Weissmuller at the Olympic Games

Johnny Weissmuller in Hollywood

Competitive swimmer who became a Hollywood leading man

Johnny Weissmuller was born János Weißmüller on June 2, 1904 in Freidorf, in former Austria-Hungary (now Romania).

Soon after, when Johnny was only seven months, his family emigrated to the USA, embarking on a twelve day trip on theS.S. Rotterdamto Ellis Island. The family settled in Chicago, where he would later discover his passion for swimming.

When Weissmuller was nine years old, he contracted polio.

Following doctor’s orders, Johnny started taking swimming lessons on Lake Michigan to recover and build stamina. He later joined the YMCA swim team at the age of twelve, discovering his love for swimming and excelling in this sport almost immediately.

It wouldn't be long before he was invited to join the Illinois Athletic Club, one of the best swim teams in the country. After a year of intense training, Weissmuller entered competitions in 1921 and immediately began winning Amateur Athletic Union races and breaking world records.

Weissmuller swam his way into the record books, becoming America's first swimming superstar by winning five Olympic gold medals and setting more than 50 world records.

He first joined the 1924Olympic Gamesin Paris, where his American citizenship was questioned by an Illinois congressman. Using his brother’s Pennsylvania baptismal records, the swimmer obtained his American passport under his brother’s name Peter John Weissmuller.

Nonetheless, he emerged as a star athlete at the games, winning gold in the 100- and 400-metre freestyle, as well as the 4×200-metre freestyle relay. He also helped the United States win a bronze in water polo.

Four years later, he took part in theAmsterdam 1928 Olympic Games, where he took gold in the 100-metre freestyle and 4×200-metre freestyle relay. His merits would later earn him a spot in the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1965.

Weissmuller parlayed his success in the pool into Hollywood stardom.

Leaving his impressive swimming career behind, he retired from competitions and continued to rise as a star by performing around the world in water shows. He supplemented his live appearances with print advertisements (modelling swimsuits) and radio and movie performances.

In 1932, he signed a seven-year contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio, and after a name change to Johnny Weissmuller, he played the role of Tarzan in the movieTarzan the Ape Man.

Weissmuller starred in twelve Tarzan films produced in Hollywood between 1932 and 1948, becoming the actor most commonly associated with the Tarzan character.

In the late 1950s, Weissmuller retired from Hollywood after a short run of the television seriesJungle Jim, though he made occasional cameo appearances until the mid-1970s.

He passed away on January 20, 1984. Despite dominating a single sport as few had, his identity as the quintessential movie Tarzan remains his most memorable legacy.

Where do the Olympic mascots come from?

Mascots are popular symbols of the Olympic Games. Even before their official integration, they have been a key part of the games. What better way to personify the Olympic values and spirit than a colourful, playful character bringing the history and culture of the host countries to young and old alike?

Olympic mascots are symbols of entertainment, design and marketing. Each modern edition of the Olympic Games has its own, which refers to the Olympic values and the identity of the place hosting the event.

The first Olympic mascot was created for the 1968 Winter Olympic Games, held in Grenoble, France. These games were the first to be broadcast in colour television. Aline Lafargue had created Shuss for the occasion, a stylised blue skier with a round and red head. His body was shaped like a lightning bolt, zig-zagging, on one foot.

The word mascot derives from the Provençal wordmascoto, a diminutive ofmascowhich means witch. The term mascot, however, became popular through Edmond Audran's operettaLa mascotte, which was staged for the first time on 29 December 1880 at the Théâtre des Bouffes-Parisiens in Paris.

The work was an immediate success, in particular because of a 'sheep and turkey duo' which were part of the staging. Set in 17th century Tuscany, the action is focused on the character of Bettina.

As one of the arias from the first act explains, she brings luck to all those for whom she works, so long as she remains a virgin. In the time that she has been working as a turkey keeper for Rocco, a farmer, he has seen his business flourish despite his previous misfortune. The two fall in love. However, the also unlucky Prince Laurent XVII hears about Bettina, and brings her to his court hoping to improve his luck.

Bettina is thus a 'mascot' - someone who brings good luck to all around her.

For the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, the mascot became official: a cute coloured dachshund called Waldi.

Since then, sometimes the mascots have been lively and friendly animals which double up as national symbols.

Amik - the mascot for the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal was a beaver, a national symbol of Canada. In 1984, the USA chose bald eagle Sam as their mascot for the Los Angeles Games. The brown bear Misha was the symbol of the 1980 Olympics in Moscow, with the bear a national symbol of the Soviet Union.

Catalan shepherd dog Cobi was the mascot of the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona.

Four Japanese owls called 'the Snowlets' represented the four major islands of Japan for the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano. Several animal mascots were also used for the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia, among them snow hare Zaika.

Hodori, a tiger cub, was the mascot for the 1988 Olympic Games from Seoul -  with a character common in Korean legends portraying the hospitable traditions of the Korean people.

Mascots can also be human-like or humanised figures incorporating history and heritage.

The Greek siblings Athena and Phevos were the mascots for the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, inspired by inspired by ancient Greece.

Neve and Gliz were the mascots for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. Their names were inspired by the Italian for snow (neve) and ice (ghiaccio).

Wenlock, the mascot for the 2012 Olympic Games in London, was joined by Mandeville, the mascot for the 2021 Paralympic Games. They were named after Much Wenlock and Stoke Mandeville, two places which held pre-cursor events to the modern Olympics and Paralympics.

For the 2020 Olympic Games in Japan, the mascot will be Miraitowa and Someity: superhero-inspired characters embodying both old tradition and new innovation.

Starting with Schuss, the commercial interest in Olympic gadgets, designed by famous illustrators and creatives, has spread. Sports objects nowadays thrill fans and collectors and have become part of our cultural heritage.

A Vlog Series with Luca Missoni - Europeana XX Ambassador of Change

Objects are useful in telling our stories: preserving them means safeguarding the past in order to inform a more conscious legacy. Many of the institutions and archives that, in Europe, have taken up the role of ‘gatekeepers of heritage’ have decided to share their collections, allowing a wider audience to get access to what for years has been hidden away or privately kept. The Missoni Archive was amongst the first institutions that understood the global cultural relevance of the materials it preserves: the history of the brand is useful to understand history at large, and this is why it is central to retrace it, understand it, and share it.

We are thrilled to announce Luca Missoni as one of the 'Ambassadors of Change’ in the Europeana XX project: an initiative aiming to retrace the twentieth century and its social, political and economic changes through archival documents available on Europeana. A supporter of the Europeana project since the very start, Luca Missoni opened the door of the archive he directs, dedicated to the preservation and valorisation of the history behind the brand his parents, Ottavio and Rosita Missoni, founded back in 1953.

The conversation revolved around three main themes, each one informing one episode of the series. The first, titledOf the Same Stripe: Values, Business, Family, focuses on the idea of family as a defining feature of Missoni, as well as an interesting characteristic of most Italian fashion houses. Retracing the story of his family, from the encounter of his parents in London to the set-up of the brand, Luca Missoni unveils how the path of the brand and that of the family are inextricably linked to one another. The same spirit that animated Rosita and Ottavio Missoni fuels the creative process of the brand today, and defines its identity. Luca also deals with the underlying meaning of being an Italian fashion brand, and how the creative and productive approach of Missoni was central in the definition of Italian - and global - prêt-à-porter.

True Colours, A Vlog Series with Luca Missoni. #1 Of the same stripe: values, business, familyfromEuropean Fashion HeritageonVimeo.

InStrong Ties: Art, Technology, Fashion, the second episode of the series, Luca Missoni ties together the main areas in which Missoni moves. The importance of art, both as inspiration and as practice, which influenced the definition of the early codes of the brand: stripes and colours. Technology is present from the ideation stage all the way through to the physical craft, as a tool to turn intuition into reality and abstract motifs into a wearable knitwear, abiding by the rules of comfort as well as of fashion and style.

True Colours. A Vlog Series with Luca Missoni. #2 Strong Ties: Art, Technology, FashionfromEuropean Fashion HeritageonVimeo.

This conversation happened in the space of the Missoni Archive, of which Luca is Artistic Director. Naturally, talking about the history of the family and of the brand through archival objects prompted the final theme of the series: heritage and preservation.Archiving Memories, Crafting Heritagecritically considers the experience of having a physical archive, its uses and challenges, and also reflects on the process of digitisation, the decision to share cultural heritage, and allow people from all over the world to study and enjoy it.

True Colours. A Vlog Series with Luca Missoni. #3 Archiving Memories, Crafting HeritagefromEuropean Fashion HeritageonVimeo.

The experiences described by Luca Missoni are truly invaluable in understanding what it means to be involved, day after day, in the valorisation of the heritage of a brand that is also the history of his own family; his words also highlight the importance in carefully editing the ‘traces’ history leaves behind, and allow to turn them into something that can induce innovation, creativity and reflection.

Spanish refugees in the Netherlands

Migrating to and from the Czech Republic

The Windrush Generation in the UK

The 20th century was a time of great migration movements across Europe and the wider world.

In previous centuries, the sources we could explore were shipping records and diairies only. In the 20th century, however, technological developments allow us to hear and see these migration movements and experience history in a much more vivid way.

Oral history recordings, radio and television interviews and reports

There's something evocative listening to people speak directly of their own experiences and, in their voices, hearing their happiness, their sadness, their hopes and fears, their hesitations and concerns. These emotions tell a story as much as their words.

Here's a snapshot of audio and video collections found on Europeana - oral history recordings, video reports, documentaries and more - which bear witness to migration in the 20th century.

During the Spanish Civil War from 1936 to 1939, many refugees left Spain for other European countries. This short film report - from Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision - shows the arrival of refugees by train in Roosendaal or Eindhoven and the transportation to the refugee centre.

13th Chamber (13. komnata) is a Czech TV show which profiles Czech and Slovak personalities, focusing on difficult times in their lives. Migration experiences feature in many of the profiles, for example, that of actress and author Anife Vyskočilová who emigrated to Bohemia from Bulgaria in the 1990s.

Watch interview with Anife Vyskočilová

Watch more episodes of 13th Chamber

This is an interview with Albertina Aparicio about her move from Trinidad to England and her work as a midwife in Thurrock.

Albertina is part of what is today known as 'The Windrush Generation': people who emigrated from the Caribbean to Britain between the late 1940s and early 1970s. These included passengers on the first ship, the HMT Empire Windrush.

The HMT Empire Windrush arrived in Tilbury in 1949 from Jamaica, carrying just over one thousand passengers. It is remembered today as one of the first large-scale post-war migration waves of people from the Commonwealth to the United Kingdom.

The interview with Albertina is one of12 interviews with people from 'the Windrush Generation'from the Essex Record Office that are available on Europeana.

During the 20th century, Ireland was very much a country marked by emigration - with successive generations moving abroad in search of new jobs and lives.

However, throughout the 20th century, communities from several nations became established in Ireland, predominently around Dublin.

Small Italian communinities moved to Ireland in the wake of World War I and World War II. By the latter half of the 20th century, around 4000 Italians were living in Ireland, often working in the catering industry.

This 1971 television show from Irish broadcaster RTE looks at Dublin's Italian communities, first and second generation Italians who have made Ireland their home.

Between the end of the 1940s and 1960s, in the wake of World War II, many Dutch citizens emigrated from the Netherlands to other countries, such as Australia. The Netherlands had been deeply affected by the war. Thousands had been killed, cities were destroyed, food shortages were common.

In this context, many Dutch people chose to begin new lives in Australia, often as part of an assisted migration programme.

This documentary from 1984 features the experiences of Dutch people who emigrated to Australia and New Zealand in the 1950s and 1960s.

Despite the years passing, many still feel homesick for the Netherlands. The programme shows how they maintain their Dutch identities, by going to Dutch festivals and listening to Dutch radio.

These interviews and reports are just a few examples of the various communities and migration movements throughout the 20th century, all of which have shaped the communities, societies and cultural diversity we see today.

Lady Godiva

Textile trade

Transport town

Coventry Cathedral

Culture from Coventry

What is the history and culture of Coventry, and what is it famous for?

City of culture projects are growing across the world, inspired in part by the success of theEuropean Capital of Cultureprogramme.

In the United Kingdom, a new city of culture is chosen every four years - highlighting art and cultural communities in that city. In 2021, that goes to Coventry, a city in the UK's midlands.

Let's take a virtual trip to Coventry, tracing connections found in Europe's cultural heritage collections.

If there's just one name to be associated with Coventry, it's Lady Godiva.

Godiva was an 11th century noblewoman, known in her time as Godgifu.

Godiva and her husband Leofric, the Earl of Mercia, were known for being generous religious benefactors. Together they funded and built monasteries and convents, by granting lands and through other donations.

However, Godiva is mostly remembered today for a legend describing an act of rebellion.

It is said that Lady Godiva sympathised with the people of Coventry who had to pay the high taxes imposed by her husband. She implored him to lower the rates, but he refused. Eventually, after much discussion, he agreed to bring down the taxes - if she rode a horse naked through Coventry.

And so she did. Lady Godiva sent word to the town that everyone should stay indoors, and rode through the town - her modesty protected by her long hair.

This legend was first told in the 13th century.

Historians now feel that, if true, it is unlikely that Lady Godiva was fully naked. Nonetheless, this has not stopped artists and authors who have told and re-told the story of Lady Godiva and her horse ride for centuries.

Coventry's role in the cloth and textile industries in England stretches back as far as the Middle Ages. The lands around the city were suited to sheep farming, thus fuelling trade in wool.

Silk weaving companies began to be established in Coventry in the 17th century, in part helped by Huguenot refugees who arrived in the city.

In the early 19th century, industrialisation led to thousands being employed in textiles. J&J Cash's, a silk weaving company founded in the 1840s, were just one of many major employers.

The ribbons below were made by Coventry manufacturers for the 1851 Great Exhibition, which celebrated advances in culture and industry.

From the 19th century industrial age, Coventry has been associated with various forms of transport - from bicycle companies to the motor industries and jet engine manufacture.

The history ofcyclingowes a lot to Coventry.

In the early 1860s, James Starley established a company making sewing machines. Several years later, in 1868, having seen a velocipede, he began to manufacture this new type of pedalled bicycle. Starley, however, developed the design which led to the 'penny farthing' style of bicycle. Starley's nephew - John Kemp Starley - continued this development, to invent the first modern bicycle, the 'Starley Safety Bicycle'.

By the 1890s, the bicycle industry was booming in Coventry. Thousands were employed in hundreds of factories, companies and manufacturers in the city.

Moving forward in transport history, Coventry became a centre for the motor industry. In 1897, the Daimler Motor Company made the first British motor car there.

Onwards through the20th century, many different car companies - including Jaguar, Rover and Standard-Triumph - have been based in or near Coventry which gained the nickname 'Motor City'.

During World War II, many of these motor companies changed their production to aircraft engines, establishing this as an industry in the city.

World War II had a devastating effect on Coventry.

Given its industrial strength, the city was singled out for bombing by the German Luftwaffe. Repeated raids led to Coventry being one of most damaged British cities duringWorld War II.

Large areas of the city were destroyed in a bombing raid in November 1940.

The historic heart of the city was destroyed, as was Saint Michael's Cathedral - the only British cathedral to be destroyed in World War II - which had stood since the 14th century.

After the war, Coventry began to re-build.

The damaged ruin of the 14th century cathedral was kept, with a new modernist cathedral built alongside it. Designed by Basil Spence and Arup, its foundation stone was laid in 1956 with the cathedral consecrated in 1962.

Coventry Cathedral has come to symbolise regeneration and growth onwards from the devastation of World War II. The city has established twinning relationships with German cities Kiel and Dresden (which had been similarly destroyed during World War II), as a gesture of peace and reconciliation.

As we have seen in this blog, Coventry is a city of change and movement. From the city's founding role in the cycling industry to the rebirth of Coventry Cathedral, the city offers cultural inspiration.

In 2021, as UK City of Culture, Coventry will show itself as a city that uses the past to forge new futures.

When China was 'à la mode' in the West

Nowadays, things made in China seem to be  everywhere, from Christmas decorations to clothes and electronics. But did you know that Chinese products have been on Western markets for centuries?

From the 17th to the 18th century, Europe had a fascination for goods coming from China. This passion for Asia gave birth to an aesthetic style dubbedChinoiserie.

Since the Antiquity, goods from the Far East had arrived on European markets. These products came from a mysterious country calledSerica, the land of silk. Even if people didn’t really know where this country was located, products from the East were synonymous with luxury and mystery.

In the 16th century, merchant ships from Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, and later from England and France sailed the Spice Routes and brought goods like silk, porcelain and lacquerwork back to Europe. Westerners were amazed by the quality and beauty of these objects, which would go on to have a great impact on the aesthetics and techniques of European art. Soon a real passion for "exotic" items from the «East Indies» (the distinction between India, China, and Japan was not always clear to the West), began.

Because of the long journey these pieces took to Europe, they were generally very rare and expensive. Owning a blue and white Chinese vase was a sign of prestige and wealth. Only rich bourgeois and nobility could buy them. European goldsmiths adorned Chinese porcelain with elaborate gold pieces and Dutch painters loved to represent Chinese vases in their nature-morte paintings.

These became  the nucleus of famous collections, and in some cases remain masterpieces in museums still today. Castles and palaces had their own "Chinese room" with wallpaper depicting landscapes of China to adequately frame lavish collections of porcelain and lacquer furniture. The most famous collector wasAugustus II the Strong, Elector of Saxony and King of Poland. He even exchanged soldiers for Chinese porcelain with the King of Prussia to enlarge his collection.

Western merchants started sending models of vases and furniture to Asia for copying, answering to European tastes. In this way, European patterns were incorporated into the decorations of Chinese-made art handicrafts.

To address the problem of the cost of import, Europeans tried to produce porcelain themselves, but the challenge was daunting. They had to find the formula that had taken Asia  centuries to develop and had been kept secret. After a lot of research and failures, the first factory was established in 1710 inMeissen, Saxony, to the great pleasure of the Elector. It marks the birth of the porcelain industry in Europe. France followed, then England and the rest of Europe joined in. The same evolution can be seen in the production of lacquer work.

European artists and craftsmen were enchanted by patterns of Chinese landscapes, birds, flowers and people. They copied them to create theChinoiseriesstyle, a unique mix between Asian and Western styles. Europeans, however, often didn’t understand the meaning of Asian motifs. Flowers often symbolized seasons:the lotus stands for summer and the chrysanthemum for autumn. pomegranates mean fecundity and peaches stand for longevity. Animals also could have a meaning: a pair of ducks signify marital bliss, and bats bring good luck.

Chinese influences also permeated  architecture. Those who could afford it wanted Chinese pavilions, bridges and pagodas for their gardens. Empress Catherine II of Russia even had a whole Chinese village at her palace of Tsarskoe Selo.

Trends are never meant to last, andChinoiseriesoon  faced competition from other artistic currents. Wealthy people, however, continued to buy  and show off their blue and white vases and lacquer desk collections. Asia continued to influence European creations too, such as Giacomo Puccini’s operaTurandotfrom 1926 or haute-couture and perfume creations from designers such as Yves Saint Laurent.

TheChinoiseriestyle is an extraordinary example of how art and techniques from different cultures can merge and mix. So, the next time you use your grandma’s precious porcelain, remember the journey it took from its faraway roots all the way to her cupboard.

Surrealist artist and rugby fan

Despite their subsequent professionalisation, most sports originate from a popular practice or hobby. However, amateur sports organisations often have difficulties in funding their activities. Thus, they sometimes try imaginative solutions to achieve their main goal of staying afloat.

This is the case for GEiEG, a rugby team from a sports association in Girona, who managed to fund themselves with the agreement of the artist Salvador Dalí.

Rugby arrived in Catalonia in 1921, but it took a long time to become a popular sport practiced in Girona.

A group of interested young people - who had discovered rugby while studying abroad - decided to start training at Devesa field in the city centre.

The project grew and, on 11 April 1971, the first Girona rugby team was presented - part of GEiEG (Grup Excursionista i Esportiu Gironí) association, which had been founded in 1919. In just seven years, the team played in four different leagues, reaching the top category by the 1978-1979 season.

In 1978, a board meeting of the team discussed the need to raise funding. Different proposals were considered, including a tour of different European countries to play friendly matches.

One proposal was to visit the painter Salvador Dalí at his home near Girona, in the fishing village of Portlligat (Cadaqués), and use his celebrity to help with fundraising.

Dalí lived in Portlligat, in the middle of the Cap de Creus Natural Park, from 1930 to 1982. He stayed there for only a few months a year with his wife and muse Gala. There, he had his studio -  a sanctuary of creation - and also received numerous visitors and participated in different happenings and performances.

At the end of 1978, a representation of the GEiEG rugby team travelled to Portlligat to deliver Dalí a rugby ball with the signatures of all the team players.

After being received by Gala, they spoke to the painter, who was interested in the evolution of rugby in Girona. They handed him the ball - a legendary Adidas Wallaby, brown with black tips. The ball today is still preserved in the Dalí house museum. In exchange for the gift, Dalí gave them a ball with his signature.

In early January 1979, two rugby managers travelled to Strasbourg to meet with Adidas. They wanted to exchange the ball signed by Dalí for team clothing and additional supporting material and money for a European tour.

When Dalí heard the news, he was reluctant as he did not want the ball to be used by Adidas for commercial or advertising purposes. So, it was also necessary to negotiate with him. Finally, it was agreed that the ball should only be displayed in the company's shop windows.

This is how on 29 September 1979, at Perpignan railway station, representatives of the GEiEG club led by the president of the association, Lluís Bachs, handed the ball to Adidas.

In return, the company undertook to deliver sports equipment for three teams for two years and 10,000 French francs, which were eventually used to fund the rugby team instead of the European tour.

Thanks to the ball signed by Salvador Dalí, the organisation obtained not only funding, but also media coverage for a sport that had not been known much in Girona.

The following year, they tried the same fundraising ploy with another international Catalan, the musician and illustrator Xavier Cugat who was based in the United States.

Born in Girona in 1900, he was a versatile artist, considered to be the leading broadcaster of Latin music in the United States. He made more than fifty films, dozens of records and numerous performances on television and radio.

In summer 1979, Cugat was in Girona attending the opening of an exhibition of his work at the Fontana d’Or gallery. That’s when a group of GEiEG representatives sent him a ball signed by the entire team, and he responded by stamping his signature and a caricature on another ball. However, unlike Dalí’s ball, Xavier Cugat’s ball is still in the hands of the sports association.

First recorded dual crossing by sea kayak of the treacherous Moskenstraumen

In this guest blog, Nicola Scott from the Scottish Maritime Museum introduces us to a 1980s sea kayaking expedition which crossed one of the world's largest whirlpools.

Today, many sea kayaking expeditions around the coasts of Europe attract experienced paddlers and novices alike. In the early 1980s, this was not the case - some waters were yet to be explored!

In 1978, four friends in their mid-twenties who were experienced kayakers - were looking for their next challenge. They decided to plan a major expedition, circumnavigating the Lofoten and Vesterålen island groups of northwest Norway.

The photograph below shows the expedition team (left to right: Angus Mathieson, Bill Turnbull, Peter Wilson and Jim Breen) with Olympic kayaker and Lendal Paddle producer, Alistair Wilson at their stand at the annual Scottish Canoe Exhibition in Edinburgh, 1980.

The expedition was to take place 200 miles inside the Arctic Circle during the summer of 1980 and include the first recorded dual crossing by sea kayak of the treacherous Moskenstraumen. Also known as 'the Maelstrom', it is one of the largest whirlpool areas in the world.

The expedition soon gained media attention, appearing in newspapers and on television.

A push for sponsorship was embarked on to raise £10,000. After sending out 800 letters, the team secured sponsorship, equipment and food from a wide range of companies including J&B Whisky, Fred Olsen Cruise Lines and Baxters foods.

The four kayaks were given Nordic and Scottish names to promote the links between the expedition team and their chosen destination.

Two were named after Somerled (a Scottish Norse King) and the Viking King Godred whom he defeated off the coast of Scotland in ninth century. The other two kayaks were named Nyvaig (Gaelic for 'little ship'), after one of Somerled's vessels, and Skuta, a Viking longboat.

The team had to improvise and make a number of items of equipment themselves; including dry bags, water-tight containers and kayak carry harnesses. Unlike today, there was not the range of specialist quality equipment to be had.

On 1 July, the expedition team launched from Stangnes on the island of Hinnøya.

Over the next 28 days they would experience stunning views of the Norwegian islands, with their rocky coastlines and majestic mountain backdrops. The photograph below shows Peter Wilson and Jim Breen looking out across the Maelstrom from Lofotodden.

That month saw a heatwave in Norway - the team endured paddling in extreme temperatures. The phenomenon of the midnight sun meant that the team could be flexible with paddling times, sometimes launching at 1am. This allowed them to avoid paddling at the hottest times of day.

The much-anticipated crossing of the Maelstrom, which could see tidal currents as strong as 20 kilometres per hour (10.7 knots), was completed successfully. At that time of year, mild weather conditions and tidal state ensured that the dual crossing posed no major challenges to the kayakers. Although the Maelstrom was 'smooth', it was hard to counter the many fast and confusing tidal flows running in the surrounding area.

The overall journey offered many challenges on what is a spectacular but severe and dangerous coast. Over 28 days, the expedition team paddled a total of 394 miles. On their return to Scotland they documented their expedition in a report in order to add to the development of the sport of sea kayaking.

This blog is based on an exhibitionInto the Maelstrom: The Scottish Kayak Expedition to North West Norway 1980.

The exhibition runs from Thursday 29 April 2021 to Monday 30 August 2021 at theScottish Maritime Museum, Irvineand from Thursday 19 May 2022 to Sunday 18 Sept 2022 at theScottish Maritime Museum (The Denny Ship Model Experiment Tank), Dumbarton.

A culinary tour across Europe to discover the meanings behind the names of some popular food

Foods enjoyed all around the world have their origins in Europe, with some displaying this through their names.

Let's take a culinary tour across Europe and discover the meanings behind the names of some popular food.

Currants are dried grapes, often used in cakes and desserts. Currants, along with raisins and sultanas, are used in particular in British cuisine in fruit cakes such as Christmas cakes.

Their name comes from Greece. They were first sold in England asraysons of coraunce, a name which stemmed from the Frenchraisins de Corinthe- named for their origin in Corinth,Greece.

These small, oily fish are eaten all around the world. Their name is believed to originate from Sardinia - as sardines were plentiful in the waters around the island.

Even though there is a county inIrelandcalled Mayo, the name for Mayonnaise does not originate from there but it is said to come from the Balearic island of Menorca.

The island's capital city Mahón is said to have given mahonnaise or salsa mahonesa its name. However, some food scholars dispute this theory.

The origin of Gouda cheese is much more clear-cut: it comes from Gouda, a town inthe Netherlands. This cheese has been made in the Gouda region since the 12th century.

Edam is another Dutch town to give its names to world famous cheeses - while the Swiss town Gruyères and valley Emmental also have cheeses named after them.

Macedonia (or macédoine) is a salad of small pieces of fruit or vegetables mixed together, part of cuisines in Greece, Romania, Spain, France, Italy and Argentina.

Though not fully proven, its name is said to derive from the empire of Alexander the Great's Macedonia which was an ethnically diverse mix of peoples.

Pilsner is a type of pale lager which originates from the Czech city Plzeň, known in English as Pilsen.

It was first produced in the 1840s by Bavarian brewer Josef Groll. Within decades, it grew in popularity as improving transport links meant it became available in Prague, Vienna and Paris. Soon, the brewing method for pilsner was being imitated across Europe.

Linzertort is a traditional Austrian pastry dessert, with a fruit filling under a pastry lattice. Its name comes from the Austrian city Linz, with recipes for the dish dating back to the 17th century.

Sport competitions in the 1920s and 1930s for members of labour and workers associations

We now associate the Olympic Games with the sporting feats of professional athletes, but there was once a time that an alternative Olympics celebrated the athletic achievements of workers.

The International Workers’ Olympiads were sporting competitions in the 1920s and 1930s in which mostly European members of labour and workers sports associations took part.

Supported by social democratic parties and International Federation of Trade Unions, these games were created as an alternative to the Olympic Games.

In the Olympic Games at the time, many of the participants were from upper social classes, and women’s participation in gymnastics and athletics did not come about until 1928. The Workers Olympiads welcomed athletes of all genders, races, religions and national origins - as well as talent and skill: participation from all levels was encouraged.

In addition, the Workers' Olympiads stressed internationalism, solidarity, peace and friendship between nations: instead of flying national flags, the red flag of international workers' movement was flown.

A first unofficial games were held in 1921 in Prague, with the first official Worker's Olympiads were held in 1925 - a winter games competition in the German town of Schreiberhau (now it is in Poland).

The first Summer Olympiads were held in Frankfurt am Main later in 1925.

Eight years after the end of World War I, Frankfurt was chosen as the host to underline the message of international cooperation in avoiding war. Frankfurt welcomed 3,000 athletes from twelve countries and 450,000 spectators.

The Workers Summer Olympiads continued through the 1920s and 1930s. The 1931 Workers' Summer Olympiad held in Vienna was the largest event - 100,000 athletes from 26 countries participated.

The last Workers' Olympiad were held in 1937 - in Janské Lázně in Czechoslovakia in winter, and in Antwerp in summer. Plans were in place for an event to be held in Helsinki in 1943, but this was cancelled due to World War II.

Abundance of energy

Mechanising  production and combustion engines

Electricity

Transportation

At the end of the 18th Century, the English scholarThomas Malthuspublished An Essay on The Principle of Population, with its core idea known as the Malthusian Trap.

This refers to a phenomenon affecting population growth and food supply. Malthus argued that while the population increases exponentially, the food supply grows linearly. Thus, population growth always outpaces food production, leading to a shortage of food and a general decrease in living standards.

When such a crisis occurs, the population decreases due to catastrophes, such as wars and famines. Malthusian ideas were quite popular as, up to that moment, natural disasters and wars cyclically halted the population growth.

However, the Industrial Revolution broke through the Malthusian ceiling.

Thanks to technological innovations in various fields, agricultural production increased. Consequently, the population worldwide increased, especially in the Western world.

In the late 19th century, a series ofscientificdiscoveries and technological innovations caused a transition from a pre-industrial to an industrial society. This transition caused global transformations, such as a demographic surge, cultural, economic, political, and environmental changes.

The synergetic technological and scientific developments that followed the invention ofthe steam enginecharacterise this period. The Czech-Canadian scholarVaclav Smilrefers to this historical moment as the ‘Age of Synergy’. This chain of technological discoveries and global changes was not inevitable. It was a result of increased scientific knowledge and luck, leading to additional inventions and discoveries.

Using fossil fuels such as coal and oil was pivotal for technological innovations such as the internal combustion engine, the electromotor, and jet engines. Some countries were rich in energy sources.

For example, the United Kingdom was well-endowed in coal, and the United States were abundant in oil.  This factor could help explain why such countries underwent early and successful industrialisation. Moreover, the abundance of fossil fuels stimulated the search for more efficient ways of extracting and refining non-renewable energy sources.

Technological breakthroughs, such as thesteam-poweredspinning mule and combustion engines, allowed productivity to soar exponentially. 
Due to the automation of production, the labour employed in agricultural and industrial production was lower than ever before. Combustion engines in particular were used extensively in agricultural production, powering  tractors and harvesters. Later on, internal combustion engines allowed the development of cars.

In the late 19th century, the diffusion of electricity revolutionised the world.

Before the employment of electricity in households, the world was a dark place from twilight until dawn. Electricity generates light, motion and heat, powering electric motors and transportation. At first, steam generators powered electricity production on a large scale.

The first electricity-generating power plant appeared in London in 1882. In the drawing below, you can see the Edison's Electric Lighting Station in New York that was established in the same year.

The late 19th century also brought new means of transport, faster, more reliable and cheaper than ever before, starting from trains and ships powered by the steam engine.

Initially, steamships and steam-powered trains were the main modes of transport. The arrival of electricity had a profound effect on transportation, powering boats and trains. However, steam-powered ships remained widely employed for their capacity to transport heavy cargos. An example is the steam-powered oil tanker in the picture.

Later on, automobiles and aeroplanes took the lead in transportation.

ThisHistoriana source collectionaims to illustrate the links between innovations in energy uses, how they influenced each other, and the possible consequences of technological innovation.

Starting from this collection, students could reflect on the connections between the transformations of the Age of Synergy. Additionally, history educators could encourage a discussion about the historical consequences of technological innovations and their possible repercussions on today’s society.

Striking illustrated advertising commemorating the games

Today we're very used to seeing corporate sponsorship of sporting events - but the practice goes back to before the 20th century.

Individual Olympic Games have had sponsors since the very first Olympics in Athens in 1896 when companies paid for advertising. However, it was not until 1980s that the Olympics made global sponsorship deals.

In 1948, the Olympic Games were held in London, the first since the end of World War II.

Dutch electronics pioneers Philips had won the contract to install the audio systems at these Games - as well as later in Helsinki (1952) and Melbourne (1956).

Marking the occasion, these six bright and colourful advertisements for Philips Radio commemorate the 1948 Olympic Games.

How counter-cultural movements took place in Germany, the Netherlands and the UK in the 1960s

British, Dutch and German counterculture movements of the 1960s could be defined as movements that would rather not be defined. This is understandable, as even the name is misleading: counterculture was about much more than just being against the mainstream.

ProfessorJerzy Jarniewicz, a Polish poet and philosopher who has been researching the history of counterculture, claims that what set counterculture movements apart from other subcultures is the sheer belief of their creators that art can change the world.

Counterculture movements inspired artists of different generations to create art that was unexpected, transgressive and revolutionary.

The 1960s were, without a doubt, the golden age of counterculture. From hippies’ headquarters in Haight-Ashbury in California to Provos running Dadaistic happenings in Amsterdam – the cultural and political resonance of these movements had never been larger. However, most of these utopian gatherings of artists-turned-activists lost their importance in one way or another within the next decade.

If counterculture could ever be flashy, it surely was in London. Counterculture found fertile ground in the United Kingdom for a number of reasons.

First of all, in the early sixties, Britons were tired of strict, conservative rules organizing every aspect of life. Secondly, due to a historic affinity with the United States, young Britons were familiar with liberating jazz music andBeatnikpoetry. Authors such asAllen GinsbergandWilliam Burroughswere celebrated in venues such as Better Books at Charing Cross Road, where they were exchanging drinks and ideas not only with local poets, but alsoPaul McCartney,Mick JaggerorSyd Barrett.

Countercultural poetry in the UK reached its climax in June 1965, when authors from all over the world gathered at the Royal Albert Hall during theInternational Poetry Incarnation. The event attracted around 7000 people, including honourable guests as Indira Gandhi.

The massive scale and media coverage of the event foretold the sudden commercialisation of British counterculture. Bands such as The Beatles and Pink Floyd ended up becoming pop culture supernovas, worldwide celebrities whose message became watered down by their mass popularity.

As British counterculture imploded by being turned into t-shirts and mugs, the movement in the Netherlands took a wholly different trajectory.

They called themselvesProvos, Dutch anarchists that fought consumerism and the daily sobriety of Protestant society. Counterculture in the Netherlands had clearly defined villains to rebel against, such as Princess Beatrix that had been about to marry 
Prince Claus von Amsberg. Von Amsberg was not only German but had also been a member of the Hitler Youth. Provos disrupted the wedding ceremony by throwing smoke bombs.

It needs to be mentioned that the roots of the Provo movement were solely pacifistic though. It originated from the Dadaistic, anti-consumerist happenings organised byRobert Jasper Grootveld.

Among Provo actions, the most recognisable were ‘The White Plans’: sets of ideas that were supposed to tackle Dutch social issues. Among them, the most iconic action was the ‘White Bicycle Plan’ – demanding that bicycles would be given priority in a city centre closed for all motorised traffic. This originally Dadaistic movement slowly reshaped into a legal, civic organisation. With one of their members elected to the city council, Provos drifted towards professional politics.

Meanwhile, in Germany, yet another countercultural movement was brewing.

Provocative, anti-consumerist Kommune 1 had much in common with the Provo movement. This group of situationists emphasised that work should be eschewed for pleasure, and that humour can also be a guerrilla tactic.

Even though Kommune 1 has never come close in popularity to the hippie communes, it drew the attention of the German mainstream media with its libertarian views. Two of their members received special media attention: the group's co-founder Rainer Langhans and his girlfriend – actress and modelUschi Obermaier. The couple became symbols of sexual revolution in Germany, and therefore were often compared to John Lennon and Yoko Ono.

Among political happenings staged by Kommune 1 the most famous was the‘Pudding-Attentat’, a hoax where the group spread rumours that United States vice-president Hubert Humphrey would be assassinated as a sign of protest against the Vietnam War. After the police raided the Kommune 1 headquarters and the officers found an assortment of alleged explosives, the group  made headlines. One day later, it became clear that the confiscated explosives contained nothing more than pudding and cheese.

Kommune 1 turned terrorism into happenings. After a policeman killed Benno Ohnesorg – a student protesting against an official visit of Shah of Iran, Reza Pahlavi in Germany – the happenings turned into terrorism. Some members of Kommune 1 became radicalised and joined the militant 2 June Movement that was allied with the Red Army Faction.

From today’s perspective, there is no doubt that the counterculture movements of the sixties were powerful. Their creators might have been beaten by the police, enticed by big corporations or outsmarted by down-to-earth politicians, yet their legacy has survived and even grown among the following generations. Once too radical and utopian, counterculture movements irreversibly changed not only mainstream culture but many other aspects of our lives, from mental health and education to urbanism. If you want proof, pick any crossroad in the Amsterdam city centre and try counting all the bicycles.

Exploring places across Europe that gave names to items of clothing, textiles and more

When we wear clothing or use fashion items, how aware are we of their histories?

Places across Europe have given their names to many items of clothing and other textiles, reflecting a rich heritage of creating fabrics through craft and industrial methods.

Let's explore this history by taking a textile tour across Europe.

The fabric denim takes its name from Serge de Nîmes, named after Nîmes, a city in France. Jeans, meanwhile, take their name from the Italian city of Genoa. Both words were coined in the 19th century, as denim and jeans began to be popular.

Manchester - a city in the north of England - is known for being a centre of the industrial revolution. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Manchester was a city associated with many factories and industries, in particular the textile industry. Manchester was a productive centre of cotton, linen and more.

Nowadays, the name manchester is used in countries across the world to denote types of textile. The Swedish for corduroy fabric is manchester. In Australia and New Zealand, manchester is used as a collective noun for household linen such as sheets, pillow cases etc., particularly in stores.

As children, many of us wear duffle coats, mostly unaware that Duffel is a town in Flanders, Belgium.

The town has given its name to the thick woolen cloth that was used to make outer garments like coats, particularly for the military. The name is also used for a type of bag which nowadays is more likely to be made from synthethic materials.

Chantilly lace is a type of hand-made lace named for the French town of Chantilly.

The lace was first made in Chantilly in the 17th century, under the patronage of the Duchesse de Longueville who popularised the style in the courts of Paris. The lace's popularity over time has changed, notably after the French Revolution when the lace-makers were executed.

However, revivals in the 19th century ensured the lace's popularity, but then chantilly lace was not being made in Chantilly but in Normandy in France and in Belgium.

Balaclavas are thick headgear used to protect the head and face from the cold. Now we mostly associate balaclavas with criminals who need to hide their faces, but balaclavas are also used by skiers and others taking part in winter sports.

The name balaclava comes from the Battle of Balaclava in the Crimean War, named for a town in present-day Ukraine.

There, the balaclava was worn by English troops unaccustomed to bitterly cold weather. However, the name did not emerge until almost 30 years later.

Though not a fabric, Cologne has given its named to a fashion item worn by men and women alike. Eau de Cologne is now used to denote perfumes and scents in concentrated form, while cologne itself can mean fragrances for men.

The name originates from Eau de Cologne, a perfume that originated from the northern German city in the early 18th century. It was created by Italian perfume-maker Giovanni Maria Farina who named it after his new home town Cologne, where he had moved in 1709.

The English word for suede fabric takes its name - via French - from Sweden. In French, the name for Sweden is Suède.

Suede, a type of leather with a raised and fuzzy appearance, takes its name from gants de suède ('gloves from Sweden') which were made out of the velvety leather.

Images and videos featuring Europe's space flights

Since the 1950s, humans have been exploring space, the final frontier.

During the 1960s, the space race was waged between the USA and USSR. Since then, space exploration and voyages have become synonymous with international cooperation - with an increasing number of European astronauts travelling to space.

Let's look at a selection of images and videos featuring astronauts from cultural heritage institutions across Europe.

Yuri Gagarin was a Soviet cosmonaut who was the first person to journey into space. In April 1961, his capsule Vostok 1 completed one orbit of the earth.

After his historic space flight, Gagarin toured many countries throughout Europe and the rest of the world.

During a visit to Athens, Gagarin became an honourary citizen of Greece and visited the Acropolis.

Russian cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova was the first woman in space, orbiting the Earth 48 times in a mission in 1963. After this mission, like Gagarin previously, she toured extensively - making 42 trips abroad between 1963 and 1970.

Even today, she is still the only woman to have completed a solo space mission.

This short video shows a telephone call between Valentina Tereshkova and Premier of the Soviet Union Nikita Khrushchev during her space mission.

This video shows highlights of Tereshkova’s visit to Cuba in 1963.

This interview with Tereshkova was filmed in 1973 during a visit to Bucharest.

Sigmund Jähn was a German cosmonaut and pilot. In 1978, became the first German to fly into space - in a collaboration between the Soviet Union and East Germany.

Bertalan Farkas was a Hungarian cosmonaut, who flew to space in 1980 along with Soviet cosmonaut Valeri Kubasov. After 7 days, they returned to Earth having completed 124 orbits.

Including an interview with Bertalan Farkas, this television show from Hungary gives an inside view to Hungarians involvement in space flight.

Wubbo Ockels, an astronaut of the European Space Agency, was the first Dutch citizen in space, part of a 1985 Space Shuttle Challenger voyage.

This documentary from Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision outlines the preparations and chronicles the space shuttle’s flight.

Dumitru Dorin Prunariu was the first Romanian cosmonaut. On 14 May 1981, he became the first and only Romanian so far to fly in cosmic space.

He spent 7 days, 20 hours and 42 minutes in space, on the Soyuz 40 mission as part of the 'Intercosmos' space program.

Prunariu trained as an aeronautical engineer. He was selected as one of three candidates for the mission in January 1978, spending three years preparing for his space flight.

André Kuipers - an astronaut from Amsterdam - became the second Dutch citizen to go to space, on a voyage to the International Space Station in 2004. At the end of 2011, he was the first Dutch astronaut to return to space beginning a 7 month mission to the International Space Station.

This report - from the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision - shows the preparations for Kuipers’ first space flight.

Videos showing services and products over the years that help us better care for our pets

Pets are more than just our faithful companions. In many cases, they are also considered extended family. They can provide us with friendship but also with emotional support, helping us to improve in our daily social lives.

With so many benefits from our furry friends, it comes to no surprise how important and central mascots have become in our society.

Over the years, new services and products have become available so we can better care for our pets.  From luxurious shelters, exclusive cemeteries for dogs, to fashion items made exclusively for pets.  This blog shows snapshots of video collections from Europeana, related to pets trends over the years.

Taking care of our pet's health is crucial. For decades, owners have invested in providing the best health care for their pets.

For instance, this video from 1924 shows pet owners taking their animals to the veterinarian for eye drops, sutures and a teeth treatment.

Codices Fennici: a digitisation project

Sanna Raninen of the Finnish Literature Society introduces Codices Fennici, a digital collection of medieval and 16th century manuscripts written or used in Finland containing more than 200 manuscripts or manuscript fragments collected from libraries and archives in different countries.

Medieval Finland might seem geographically far removed from the famous European centres of book culture.

Much of the medieval book culture of Nordic countries is better known through their survival through destruction. One such example is theFragmenta Membraneacollection - leaves from medieval books which were confiscated by the Crown in the 16th and 17th centuries, unbound and reused as covers for bailiffs’ account books.

Fortunately, not all medieval books ended up as recycling material, as shown byCodices Fennici, a digital resource that brings together all 238 known manuscripts of Finnish provenance.

The sources presented in the database date from the medieval period to 1600, covering the beginning of the early modern era and the early changes in manuscript culture catalysed by the formation of the Kingdom of Sweden in 1523 and the religious Reformation which followed.

The collection includes books of liturgy and religious texts, legal records and law codices, account books and personal copybooks, as well as miscellaneous surviving items of medieval and early modern Finnish book culture, inviting historical and archival research to extend beyond the traditional division literary centres and peripheries surrounding them.

These manuscripts tell the story of the adoption and adaptation of imported books in medieval Finland, as well as the first steps of local book production and development of Finnish as a written vernacular language.

As the origins of literary culture in Finland are linked to the establishment of Christianity in the area, it is not surprising that liturgical and other religious literature makes up a quarter of the titles presented in Codices Fennici.

One of the earliest surviving examples is a Dominican breviary originating from England (Helsinki, National Library, C.IV.10).

The book arrived in Finland by the end of the 15th century at the latest, which can be ascertained from the later scribal addition of votive mass days particular to the calendar of feasts observed in the Diocese of Turku (Åbo).

Liturgical book culture did not only rely on imported items. Local production of liturgical material became especially relevant through religious Reformation in the 16th century and the gradual adoption of local vernacular for worship.

On the other end of the time scale present in the database is a 1605 book titledOfficia Missaecontaining sung introits, which are chants sung at the beginning of the Mass at the entry of the minister and the celebrants, translated and melodically adapted for Finnish language by Michael Gunnerus, a schoolmaster in the city of Porvoo (Borgå).

Medieval liturgical books remained in use long after the official Reformation of the Kingdom of Sweden, and it is not unusual that one codex contains parts collated over several centuries. The codices have often survived in a fragmented state through centuries of remodelling and eventual obsolescence.

Like liturgical books, legal codices also enjoyed a long shelf life in medieval and early modern book culture. Codices Fennici holds over twenty separate titles ofMagnus Erikssons stadslag(City laws) andKristofers landslag(Country laws) ranging from the mid-14th century to the end of 16th century.

As Swedish was the administrative language of the kingdom to which Finland belonged, it is not surprising that most books listed in Codices Fennici contain written Swedish.

The development of Finnish vernacular in administrative tasks is seen in a Finnish translation ofKristofers landslag(Helsinki, National Library, C.III.10): at the end of the book is a dictionary with words relating to familial relations written in Latin, Swedish and Finnish.

The surviving sources in Codices Fennici are geographically concentrated on the western part of modern-day Finland, due to sparser populations in the east and the region’s occasionally restless history.

There are some records from Eastern Finland, including court records from the province of Savo, collated by Judge Jesper Sigfriedsson in 1563–1564 (Vaasa, Provincial Archives of Vaasa, Savo Judicial Province Archives CA:1).

From beyond the reach of the kingdom, relations with Russia - the eastern neighbour - are recorded inDiplomatica Muscovitica(Stockholm, National Archives, vols.654&655), which contains copies of documents regarding delegations to, and correspondence with, Russia.

This digitisation project was initiated at the Finnish Literature Society in 2013. Codices Fennici has collated items from 22 archival institutions from the Nordic countries, ranging from individual church archives to national libraries and museum collections.

The manuscripts are available for browsing either by institution or as individual items, while the search tools allow for more detailed options for particular year, provenance, language, or associated persons. Each manuscript is presented with metadata conforming to the Dublin Core standard, the digitised manuscript along with a TEI encoded transcription.

Behind the scenes of a sport equipment company

The right sporting equipment is important, helping us reach our goals.

We don't often get to see behind the scenes of how this equipment is made. Let's explore the Weha sporting good factory, with archive photography from the German Olympic and Sport Museum.

The WEHA sporting equipment firm was founded in 1907 by German master saddler Wilhelm Heinrich, focusing initially on fencing equipment. It was based in Berlin.

After World War I, the company began to create more sporting equipment - in particular for boxing.

In Germany, boxing had been banned until 1919. With no previous market, there were no other German companies making boxing equipment.

Thus, WEHA became the first German company to manufacture boxing gloves.

Weha boxing gloves soon grew in popularity, worn by amateurs and professionals alike. They were used in many national and world championships. German champion boxer Max Schmeling was among those using Weha boxing gloves.

In addition to boxing equipment, Weha produced sporting goods for land and roller skate hockey, ice hockey, fencing, rugby and jiu jitsu.

In 1936, Weha won a contract to supply equipment to the 1936 Olympic Games being held in Berlin. Organised by Nazi Germany, these games were controversial due to being used as a propaganda tool by Adolf Hitler.

They supplied boxing equipment, as well as items for hockey. India's hockey team were the champions of the 1936 Olympics, declaring Weha's equipment to be the best in the world.



Can you help us to tell the story of sport in Europe in the past and the present?

We invite you to tell us about your sport experiences through objects like photographs, memorabilia, equipment or prizes.

Architecture and cultural heritage of the Armenian diaspora

Armenia is a land-locked country in the Caucasus region of Eurasia. It was one of the first states in the world to adopt Christianity as its official religion in the late 3rd or early 4th century.

For centuries, Armenians have moved to many cities and countries across Europe, establishing communities.

Particularly since World War I, in the wake of the 1915 Armenian Genocide, many Armenians were forced to leave their homeland.

In this blog, we explore traces of the Armenian diaspora found across Europe in digitised cultural heritage collections.

This Armenian church is located in the centre of Amsterdam. The church was founded around 1715, with the year carved in the flagstone above the main door.

Nearby the church, a bridge is named Armeensebrug (Armenian Bridge).

San Lazzaro degli Armeni is a small island in Venice which has been home to the monastery of an Armenian Catholic congregation since 1717.

This 2012 documentary from Czech Television explores the everyday activities of the spiritual representative of Armenians in the Czech Republic and those he cares for.

Watch the documentary here

St Sarkis Armenian church in London is the largest Armenian church in the UK. It is located in Kensington and was built during the 1920s.

These photographs show soldiers operating machinery in a workplace manufacturing macaroni for the Greek army during the 1919-1922 Greco-Turkish War. The factory, which is located in Smyrna (today this is Izmir in Turkey), is described as being a former Armenian cinema.

This documentary explores Armenian carpet makers living in Hungary, presenting a profession that is vanishing.

From 1922 to 1991, Armenia was part of the Soviet Union with internal migration establishing Armenian communities in other former-Soviet states. These photographs show Armenians in the Baltic states (Estonis, Latvia, Lithuania) taking part in events in the run up to those states' independence in the late 1980s.

The St Gregory the Illuminator Church is an Armenian church in Tallinn, capital of Estonia. It was given to the Armenian community in Estonia in 1994 for their use. It is estimated that around 1,000 Armenians live in Estonia.

This small chapel is located in Solna, a municipality to the north of Stockholm. The chapel was built in the 1870s on Överjärva farm. It is also known as the Armenian chapel, as the farm had been leased by Ohan Demirgian, an Armenian who was the stablemaster for King Charles XV.

How shipping lines advertised transport for migration

In the late 19th century and early 20th century, millions of people migrated between Europe and North and South America, Australia and more.

Great shipping lines - such as Red Star Line, Holland-Amerika Line, Koninklijke Hollandsche Lloyd - brought passengers on their long voyages to their new lives.

Many people departed Europe theought the great ports at Antwerp, Rotterdam and Hamburg.

We present a selection of advertisements and newspaper clippings showing the destinations and day-to-day travel behind these migration voyages.

What are some of the longest and shortest placenames in Europe?

The word Europe is only six letters long, but those six letters hold a lot of different concepts and notions.

Across Europe, placenames vary in length depending on linguistic rules - some languages favour brevity, some allow compound words which extend into long, complicated words.

On Europeana, we feature collections from all across Europe, so let's explore some linguistic length-based locations. In these examples, we may not always bring you to the exact location but the images will illustrate somewhere nearby.

Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch is a village in Anglesey in Wales, which is often credited with the title for longest town name in Europe. Its 58 characters can be translated to English as 'St. Mary’s Church in the hollow of white hazel near a rapid whirlpool and the Church of St. Tysilio near the red cave'.

The town has a population of around 3,000 people. Originally called Llanfairpwllgwyngyll, it is thought the longer form of the name was adopted in the 19th century to boost tourism and commerce.

With 35 letters, Äteritsiputeritsipuolilautatsijänkä is the longest place name in Finland.

It is a bog marshland area in Savukoski, a municipality in the east of Lapland. Savukoski has around 1000 inhabitants, with one of the lowest population densities among Finnish settlements.

The photographs below are not from Äteritsiputeritsipuolilautatsijänkä itself but the Savukoski region.

We stay in boggy landscapes at Gasselternijveenschemond - a hamlet in the Dutch province of Drenthe, which translates to "Delta of Gasselt's new bog".This rural location is near the municality of Aa en Hunze, and has a population of several hundred people.

Schmedeswurtherwesterdeich is found in the northwest of Germany, part of the Schleswig-Holstein state. It is a small hamlet of a few homes nearby to the district of Dithmarschen, which features in this map.

Bullaunancheathrairaluinn is a townland on Inishmore, the largest of the three Aran Islands off the west coast of Ireland.

In Irish, it isBallán an Cheathrair Álainn. 'An Cheathrair Álainn' relates to church dedicated to theFour Comely Saints(an Ceathrar Álainn) - a collective name for four saints in the early Irish Christian church (Fursey, Brendan of Birr, Conall and Berchán).

These photographs show the karst landscape and ruined churches of Inishmore.

Pino sulla Sponda del Lago Maggiore is a former municipality on the shores of Lake Maggiore in Italy, which merged with other nearby municipalities in 2014.

Before this, along with San Valentino in Abruzzo Citeriore, it held the record for the longest comune name in Italy. Pino sulla Sponda del Lago Maggiore lies on the shores of Lake Maggiore which are shown in these pictures.

Å is a small fishing village in the Lofoten Islands, an archipelago in the Arctic circle which are part of Norway.

Å's population is (population 150). Until the 1990s, fishing was an important industry with tourism now of equal importance. In Å, you can visit the Lofoten Stockfish Museum and the Norwegian Fishing Village Museum.

Å means river or stream, so is used in the name of several places. Å is often called Å i Lofoten to distinguish it from those other places named Å.

Ì is a shortened form of the Scots Gaelic name for the island of Iona - Ì Chaluim Chille.

Iona, off the west coast of Scotland, is known for Iona Abbey, a well-preserved Middle Ages religious building. It was founded as a monastery by Saint Columba in the 6th century, growing to become a centre for Christianity and Christian missionaries in Scotland.

Ö is a locality in the north of Sweden, part of a municipality called Ånge. In 2015, Ö had a population of just 90 people.

Ånge is known as Sweden's geographical centre, which is situated by the lake Munkbysjön - as measured by the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in 1947.

Sé is a former parish, part of the Portuguese capital city Lisbon. It was created as a parish in 1150. It shares a colloquail name with the city's Roman Catholic cathedral, the Santa Maria Maior de Lisboa. Built in 1147, it is often known as Sé of Lisbon.

Aa is a small coastal village in the north of Estonia. In the year 2000, its population was around 200 people. It is the location of the Aa manor house, built in the 15th century, which is now an old persons home.

Ry is a town in Denmark, with a population of 6,600. Located in central Jutland, Ry is nearby to Himmelbjerget, one Denmark's highest natural points which 'soars' to a height of 147m.

Discover the stories of pioneering female archaeologists from across Europe

From the early days of archaeology, women have made significant contributions, yet their work is less well known. Today, around half of all archaeologists are women. They supervise excavations, survey and research sites of all periods, work in conservation and heritage management. In museums, women care for archives and collections, advise on how climate change impacts on historic sites, work with the public, and transfer their knowledge and skills to the next generation.

In this blog, we introduce six pioneering women archaeologists and their stories.

Jane Dieulafoy (1851 - 1916)was a French explorer, archaeologist and a writer who excavated the site of Susa with her husband, Marcel-Auguste Dieulafoy, in the 1880s. Today. their finds from Susa form part of the Iranian collection at the Louvre.

Jane had a traditional up-bringing but a far from conventional life. After marrying, she went with her husband to the front during the Franco-Prussian war, putting on a soldier's uniform to fight.

Later, when they began their journey through Persia to Susa, Jane continued to dress in men’s clothes and cut her hair short. As most archaeologists today wear trousers in the field, it is surprising to note that Jane required special permission for this as it was illegal for women in France at the time.

Throughout her journeys and on site, Jane kept detailed diaries and  photographs of the remains. During the excavations, she supervised large all-male teams of local workers, while recording and mapping their finds.

Anna Apostolaki (1881 – 1958)was born in Crete, and qualified as a teacher from the University of Athens. She broke boundaries by becoming the first woman to be a member of the Archaeological Society of Athens, as well as one of the first female graduates from the University of Athens.

Anna went on to become the first curator of the National Museum of Decorative Arts in 1926, caring for its collections and becoming internationally known for her research on ancient textiles, weaving traditions and folk art. She worked at the museum through the inter-war period publishing a catalogue on Coptic textiles. 
Anna was a founding member of the Lyceum Club of Greek Women and gave her first lecture to members on the Palace of Minos at Knossos in 1911. She was speaking in public at a time when much of the scientific world was dominated by men.

Tessa Verney Wheeler (1893 – 1936)was an accomplished archaeologist who excavated a number of important sites in Britain with her husband, Mortimer Wheeler. The Wheelers were considered to be a team in their lifetime: together, they ran excavations, developing excavation methods and publishing their work.

Their last joint excavation of the Iron Age hill fort at Maiden Castle was funded by public donations, largely as a result of Tessa's efforts. The Wheelers were pioneers in filming their excavations and in bringing them to public attention. Tessa spoke frequently at historical societies and encouraged people to visit excavation sites.

But it was perhaps as a teacher of the next generation that Tessa made her most important contribution. Numerous female archaeologists including Kathleen Kenyon, Beatrice de Cardi, Veronica Seton-Williams, Ione Gedye and Molly Cotton all learned excavation techniques from Tessa Wheeler. Shortly before her death she was instrumental in the creation of the Institute of Archaeology in London.

Marija Gimbutas (1921 – 1994)was born in Vilnius, Lithuania, and emigrated with her family to the United States in 1949. She took up a post at Harvard University and later became professor of Archaeology at University of California, Los Angeles from 1963 until 1989.

Marija was internationally known for her research into Baltic Neolithic and Bronze societies and for her ‘Kurgan hypothesis’, which explored the migration of peoples in an Indo-European region. Her other research focused on female figurines. She gained fame for three English language books on the theme of the civilization of the goddesses of ‘old Europe’.

While some of her ideas have been challenged, her interpretation of Neolithic and Bronze age Europe as having complex social organisation, religious practices and a material culture filled with meaning continue to inspire and provoke new research.

This blog wouldn't be complete without highlighting some of the women working in archaeology today.

Shahina Faridis a British archaeologist who is best known for her work as Field Director of excavations at the Neolithic site at Çatalhöyük.

Shahina worked at Çatalhöyük for 20 years until 2012. Her work on the Çatalhöyük stratigraphic sequence is a cornerstone of archaeological and scientific studies, reflected in her publication record of over 40 articles and reports. Currently, she works for Historic England as a scientific dating coordinator.

Ann Degraeveis Head of the Archaeological Department of the Heritage Direction, Ministry of the Brussels Capital Region, Belgium and Secretary to the Board of the European Archaeological Council.

Ann writes 'my work consists of the archaeological excavation management for the Brussels Capital Region (archaeological legislation, public procurement, guidelines for archaeological excavations in the Brussels Capital Region), archaeological collections and data management (database development), conservation and digitisation of the archaeological archives of the Brussels Capital Region and digital archaeological heritage developments.'

These stories give a snap shot of the many different roles and contributions that women have made to archaeology across Europe and beyond from its beginnings and continue to make today.

Questioning the status quo through fashion

The suit has been very much associated with men and has become one of the most recognisable symbols of men’s fashion.

However, throughout the 20th century, the suit has been appropriated by women and those of other genders for various reasons: to rebel against constricting and complicated attire, to be free to perform sport and tasks once exclusively in the domain of men, to assert equality in the workplace or on the street or to shock and play with the binary definition of gender.

Although male designers are often celebrated for giving women ‘power uniforms’, female designers have been innovative and subtle in their response to the needs of their fellow women.

Their shared experience of femininity has allowed them to cater to the needs and desires of the women of their generation, using the female body to make a statement through fashion’s key components: construction, volume, fabric and detail.

One of the first names that come to mind isLucy Christiana, alias Lady Duff-Gordon and known to the fashion world as ‘Lucile’.

Working in the early20th centurybetween Europe and America, the British designer became known for her elegant evening wear. But it is in her approach to daywear that her feminist views become more manifest: her simple tailored suits symbolised a new approach for women, confident to stride forward and campaign for their rights.

Coco Chanelis widely acclaimed for her streamlined and elongated silhouettes, but it is her groundbreaking work on textiles that demonstrated her innate understanding of the feminine body and comfort.

Her suits, cut inbouclé woolbut above all in elasticjersey, are an ode to the carefree, almost brazen feminine attitude of the 1920s and 1930s.

Elsa Schiaparelliand her witty interpretation of surrealism in fashion showed women how to turn a suit into an exploration of their inner self, and of the reality surrounding them.

The 1980s saw suits for women spreading across the world. Designers such asGiorgio Armaniare said to have taken inspiration from masculine wardrobes to furnish women with an attire that could help them in their everyday battle to gain power and equal prominence in society.

While broad shoulders and rigid shapes were omnipresent in the designs of Armani,Thierry MuglerandRalph Lauren, women designers started questioning the so-called ‘power suit’ and began playing with its characteristic details.

Talented designers asAnne Marie BerettaandPopy Moreniproposed their ironic take on ‘strong’ suits, showing women that they did not necessarily need to abandon their own identities in order to succeed and get what they wanted - and deserved.

These women designers are examples of the ways in which feminine sensibility and first-hand experience made its way into the fashion system - a realm that is very much still in the hands of men, yet mostly aimed at female consumers.

Recovering these experiences through the objects kept in heritage collections allows us to unveil relevant stories that can help to rewrite history and turn it intoherstory, or at least to propose  a nuanced version of what we (think we) know and often take for granted.

Animating inequality between men and women in all areas of society

Women are generally paid less than men: the gender pay gap is this difference in pay, but also the gender gap speaks to inequality between men and women in all areas of society.

If we continue at the current pace, it will take Europe more than 60 years to completely close the gender gap.

Here are some animated GIFs - submitted as part of our yearly competitionGIF IT UP- that illustrate the inequalities women face in our society.

Women are under-represented at all levels of political participation and decision-making worldwide.

Since the beginning of cinema, women have been involved in filmmaking. Alice Guy is considered to be the first female film director. This blog explores her life and legacy.

Alice began working in filmmaking as a secretary for Léon Gaumont who ran an early motion picture production company.

After attending the first demonstration of film projection by the Lumière brothers in 1895, she was convinced that film can be used not only for documenting events but also as a tool for storytelling.

In 1896, she wrote and directedLa Fée aux Choux(The Fairy of the Cabbages), a short film referring to an old fairy tale. Although Alice's debut has not survived today, it is recognised as the first instance of storytelling in cinematography.

Remade in 1900,La fée aux choux(The Cabbage Fairy) by Alice Guy-Blaché (originally from 1896).

She became the head of Gaumont's film production arm inParis-  a job she had to abandon after getting married.

Though that didn't stop her from film making. She moved with her husband to the United States, where, in 1910, she started her own company, Solax, becoming the first woman to run her own studio.

Alice was a multi-talented filmmaker: she directed, produced, wrote and oversaw the creation of hundreds of films. More than 20 of these were feature-length.

She was also a pioneer with the topics covered in her films. She explored the idea of marriage as an equal partnership inMatrimony’s Speed Limit(1913) and reversed gender roles inIn the Year 2000(1912). She also made action films with female characters as heroes, such asTwo Little Rangersin 1912. She directed one of the first films with an all Black cast,A Fool and His Money(1912).

After her divorce, Alice had to auction her film studio and decided to return toFrancein 1922.

She found it difficult to re-enter the French film industry, even with her previous employer the Gaumont Studios. Alice briefly returned to the United States in order to find copies of her films which could help her find work.

Unfortunately, she found none and she never made another film.

Concerned with her absence from the historical record of cinematography, she made many attempts to set the record straight.

While writing her autobiography, Alice prepared lists of all the films in which she was engaged, hoping to have her work acknowledged and properly credited. She also wrote numerous letters to colleagues and film historians correcting already published mistakes or omissions regarding her career.

These actions bore fruit. However, most of the appreciation happened after Alice's death in 1968, when film researchers started to fill in many knowledge gaps about earlycinema.

With documentaries popularising her life - likeQui est Alice Guy?(1975),The Lost Garden: The Life and Cinema of Alice Guy-Blaché(1995) and the most recentBe Natural: The Untold Story of Alice Guy-Blaché(2018) - Alice's legacy is now widely recognised.

The social history of the kimono represents a unique cultural exchange between Japan and Europe

Needing little introduction, the kimono is the iconic, elegant Japanese dress that so many of us admire and appreciate. The more we explore the social history of the kimono, the more we learn that over the last two centuries, it has represented a unique cultural exchange between Japan and Europe.

Kimono, which simply means ’a thing to wear’ has more than a thousand years of history. Since its establishment as the de facto national dress in Japan during the 16th century, it has often been used as an everyday canvas where political, social and personal statements were made. Over time, as new techniques and motifs developed, kimono became works of art in their own right.

Being a 'one-size-fits-all' garment, people relied on the patterns rather than the design and fit to express their identities. With its classic ‘T’ shape, the back of the garment would become the canvas on which designers and weavers – men and women - could express their creativity.

Women were by no means the passive recipients of these garments. Many were employed in their production and some - like the early 19th century maverick Den Inou - even invented new dyeing techniques. Inou single-handedly invented the Kurume Kasuri dying technique when she was only twelve years old. It went on to become a popular technique used on kimono and much more.

The kimono was worn by all classes, ages and genders in Japan, but the ‘big statement’ designs remained largely reserved for women. This was especially the case with sophisticated designs of the imperial court, samurai aristocracy and affluent merchant classes that emerged from the 19th century.

The story of the kimono underwent a paradigm shift when Japan opened up for the first time in centuries in the late 19th century, initially in the later Edo period and more emphatically in the Meiji era (1868-1912).

The former resulted in a cultural exchange with the Dutch and the latter with the rest of the Western world. It was the age of the Great Exhibitions across Europe and the United States, where kimono were worn and showcased alongside masterfully produced enamels, metalwork, lacquer-work and silk textiles that stunned and enchanted crowds.

The kimono became a subject of immense fascination, particularly for Western artists who depicted the garment beautifully and frequently in their work.

'In a way, all my work is founded in Japanese art' said Vincent Van Gogh who famously paintedThe Courtesan, a woman wearing a kimono. Other paintings by artists such as Whistler, Breitner and Roussel depicted Western women wearing kimono helped popularise the dress among a certain class of women in Europe.

In fact, kimono could be bought in shops such as Liberty's of London, even if the actual wearing of it remained limited to the artistic and social elite – and that too was restricted to indoors. Wearing this loose, 'exotic' garment resulted in turning the kimono into a risqué or bohemian symbol.

'In late 19th-century Europe and America, the kimono could represent a number of things,' says Anna Jackson, Keeper of the Asian Department at the Victoria & Albert Museum. 'It signified something artistic, fashionable, exotic and, at times, non-conformist. In the aesthetic interior it could denote a woman's social confinement, while hinting at the supposed eroticism of the East. It could also be liberating, offering a new form of dress unrestricted by tight corsets.'

And yet it wasn't only kimono that influenced Western dress, but also Western fashion and culture in turn influenced the evolution of the kimono in Japan throughout the 20th century.

During the Taishō and early Shōwa periods (from 1912 up to World War II), women were inspired to wear even bolder and more striking designs, encouraged by the art movements sweeping Europe - mainly Art Nouveau and Art Deco, but also Expressionism, Futurism and Cubism.

In addition to Western dress becoming rapidly dominant due to the cultural changes sweeping across Japan, kimono were becoming cheaper, more innovative and fashionable. Technologies such as synthetic dyes and machine stitching as well as a number of Western design motifs began to radically change the nature and accessibility of the garment across Japan, particularly in urban centres.

Women in both Europe and Japan were finding new ways of expressing themselves through the kimono.

Kimono for men certainly had their place, but it was those made for women that had the most impact.  This conversation across continents has continued to the present day, seen clearly through exhibitions and publications as recent as 2019, when the kimono was the focus of the exhibition Kimono: Kyoto to Catwalk at the V&A Museum.

The Khalili Collections – which holds one of the world’s most important collections of kimono - was the main contributor to the exhibition, which is currentlytouring Europe.

Kimono shall forever be unique - rarely had non-Western garments (with special focus given to the ones made for women) been so integral to cross-cultural, generational, and artistic inspiration.

First Dutch gold medal winner at the Winter Olympic Games

Sjoukje Dijkstra was born on 28 January 1942 in Akkrum, a village in the Dutch province of Friesland. As the daughter of an Olympic speed skater, the doctor Lou Dijkstra, Sjoukje came into contact with the sport at a very young age.

When Dijkstra turned six years old, she received her first skates as a birthday present from her father. It turned out to be the perfect gift.

That same year she started training in the ice rink at the Apollohal in Amsterdam. The training sessions were held in a roped-off area during general opening hours, but that was not a problem for Dijkstra: 'I was six years old and just happy to be on the ice.' There, her distinct talent for figure skating became obvious.

When she was just 11 years old, Dijkstra went to London for a number of months to train under the tutelage of the skilled but aloof coach Arnold Gerschwiler. He would remain her coach throughout her competitive career.

The hard training paid off. Dijkstra started competing at a very young age, becoming the first Dutch figure skater to make it to major international championships. She made her debut at 14 in the Cortina d'Ampezzo 1956 Winter Olympics, earning the 12th spot in the competition.

By the beginning of the 1960s, the 'swinging Frisian' had become a popular ice figure skater. That year Dijkstra won the silver medal in the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley, California.

The peak of her career took place on February 2, 1964, during the Olympic Winter Games in Innsbruck, Austria.

Dijkstra jumped and danced to win the Olympic title with great conviction. Under the watchful eye of the royal family, she earned the first gold medal ever won for the Netherlands at the Winter Games. In honour of this, she was appointed Knight in the Order of Oranje-Nassau.

With this impressive title under her belt, it seemed like Dijkstra had won everything there was to win.

Besides having participated three times in the Winter Olympics, she participated in many other international competitions. Dijkstra was the European champion five times each year between 1960 and 1964 and world champion three times world champion between 1962 and 1964. She was also named Sportswoman of the Year six times (1959-1964).

In 1964, Dijkstra decided to switch her sports career into the ice revue and joined the companyHoliday on Ice, showing her masterful ice skating skills to a bigger audience.

Today, Sjoukje Dijkstra is a celebrity in national and international sports history. On January 9, 2014, she was inducted into the International Figure Skating Hall of Fame at a ceremony during the 2014 U.S. Championships in Boston, Massachusetts. She remains a source of inspiration for many who aspire to have a career in ice skate sports.

Defining author of Japanese literature in the Heian period

Murasaki Shikibu’sThe Tale of Genjiis sometimes said to be the first modern novel ever written: a fictional story set in the real world, with a sequence of events focusing on the psychological development of the main character and surrounding minor characters.

It was written in 11th century Japan by Murasaki Shikibu,  an influential court lady-in-waiting. The Tale of Genji is one of the greatest Japanese classics of literature, which gives amazing insights into Japanese high society in a period of radical change.

Duringthe Heian period(8th-12th Centuries CE), Japan became more and more independent and isolated from China, distinguishing itself in language, customs, and writing.

Murasaki grew up around this time, born into a low-ranking aristocratic family. Her father taught his son classical Chinese, as was customary. Murasaki listened in on the lessons and was soon more fluent in Chinese than her own brother. In this period, women were generally believed to be less intelligent than men and thus weren't taught the Chinese language. Her father would exclaim:

Just my luck, what a pity she was not born a man!

She would later combine all of these influences in her own literary work, making the Tale of Genji a remarkable testament to both Chinese and Japanese literary history.

The tale of Genji was written inkana, a Japanese script derived from Chinese. Part of the individualisation of Japan from China showed in the development of its own writing around the second half of the 9th Century. The fact that Murasaki's work was written in this script cemented it as one of the earliest and most highly esteemed pieces of Japanese literature.

Murasaki got her name, confusingly, probably in reference to the main female character in her own famous novelthe Tale of Genji. Murasaki Shikibu was not her given name, but the name used to describe her in the imperial court records and diaries handed down to us.

The name is also linked to the colour purple. When Murasaki is depicted, she is often wearing purple robes in reference to this. She's also often shown in Ishimyama temple, staring up at the moon during the night, wistfully, seeking inspiration. The legend says that it is here, looking at the moon, that the inspiration forThe Tale of Genjicame to Murasaki.

The novel describes the life of Genji, the son of a Japanese emperor, who is removed from the line of succession and instead pursues a career as an imperial officer. The book focuses on Genji's romantic exploits with multiple women, as well as the life and costumes at the Heian court.

Murasaki drew from her own experience as alady-in-waitingfor the Japanese Empress Shōshi.

Women lived secluded from the men at the Japanese court, mostly busying themselves with writing diaries, creating poetry, and discussing literature in court salons. Even before the completion of The Tale of Genji, Murasaki became well-known for her poetry and writing excellence. Empress Shōshi sought out Murasaki as a companion and a tutor to add to her salon, increasing Shōshi's standing at court.

It's known that the novel was released in multiple volumes over a period of several years. Murasaki would have distributed handwritten copies of her chapters to friends, who would, in turn, have copied it and passed it onto others. Murasaki's book was a hot commodity all over Japan, many seeking out the new chapters so they could read the continuation of the story.

The novel was probably completed around 1021. Emperor Ichijō had the novel read to him, a rare occurrence since the book was written in Japanese, where it was customary for male courtiers to only deal with the Chinese language.

AsThe Tale of Genjiwas copied over and over and spread throughout Japan's provinces, during her life and certainly after her death Murasaki became a literary legend.

Murasaki's work became required reading for all court poets as early as the 12th Century. The emotionality and sensitivity shown in her writing made her works exemplary ofConfucian philosophy.

Murasaki herself, as well as Genji and other characters from her books became popular topics in Japanese art. Scenes from the book were often depicted in woodblock prints and otherukiyo-eartwork, it became customary for dowries to include intricately carved artifacts or illustrations from The Tale of Genji.

Murasaki's influence is still felt to this day, as a genius writer and courtesan who defied the norm of how women were thought of in that period.

Who was Simone Veil?

What causes was Simone Veil dedicated to?

What European roles did Simone Veil hold?

Simone Veil was a French politician who survived the Holocaust and the first female President of the European Parliament.

Simone Veil was a French politician whose life symbolises 20th century Europe, reflecting both its high and low points. She was described byJean d'Ormessonas: 'We cannot classify her among political women at all, she was much more than that, she was a sort of conscience of France and Europe'.

Simone Veil was born in Nice in the south of France in 1927 to middle-class Jewish parents.

They very much represented the modern secular Jewish world view of the first half of the 20th century. They were active in various social Jewish organisations, known to be staunch supporters of the secular state and the French values of Liberty, Fraternity and Equality.

With the rise of Nazism in Europe these values were put to a most stringent test, with tragic outcomes.

In 1944, at the age of 16, Simone and her entire family - like the majority of Europe's Jews - were deported to concentration camps. Her parents and brother were murdered - only Simone and her two sisters survived the war.

After the war, Simone and her sisters decided to remain inFrance- unlike many Jews who, after having survived the horrors of the concentration camps, emigrated to Israel and North America.

Veil would dedicate the rest of her life to public service defending women's rights, helping underrepresented communities and rebuilding Europe from the ashes ofWorld War II.

As the French minister of health in the 1970s, she was a staunch supporter of women’s reproductive rights.

Under her tenure as a minister, contraception became more accessible and, in 1975, abortion was legalised. To this day, the law protecting women’s rights to control their bodies is called theVeil Law.

Veil served as an elected official of theEuropean parliamentfrom 1979 to 1993.

For the majority of this period, she held the position of president. In this capacity, she worked tirelessly to defend human rights, strengthen intra-European ties, promote European culture and protect the most vulnerable in society.

Even after retiring from politics, Veil remained active in French society.

In 2008, Veil was elected to theAcadémie Francaise, being only the sixth woman in the institution's almost 500 year old history to receive such an honour, as well as one of the few politicians to ever be invited to join the 'immortal forty'.

Until the end of her life Veil continued to break barriers. She insisted that if she'd be given the honour to be buried in the Panthéon - an honour bestowed upon only the most esteemed French citizens, such as Voltaire andMarie Curieamong others - she would only accept if her husband could be buried next to her.

This request was granted bypresident Emmanuel Macronwhen she passed away in 2017.

To this day Veil continues to be one of the most beloved Frenchwomen of all time.

What visual representations of women working tell us about women’s history

Women’s roles as workers have evolved over time. Despite some believing that women are not workers, they have in fact been contributing heavily through the centuries. How has the role of women changed over time? How have patriarchal societies chosen to portray women’s contribution?

Let’s explore the role of women at different historical moments through visual arts which can tell us about that time’s dominant perspectives. The history of women is often a form of re-interpretation, as visual representations may merely reflect what their creators or their patrons chose to convey.

The early Middle Ages are often imagined as the time when people sustained themselves through agriculture, but it is also the time when trade in goods led to large markets across Europe and beyond.

Some activities, such as spinning for cloth manufacturing centres, were carried out by both women and men. Furthermore, even though boys were more likely than girls to attend schools, it was not unusual for nuns in convents to teach small numbers of girls.

Women have worked as sex-workers for centuries. In some countries, prostitution was so common that sex-workers earnings were taxed and laws were passed to restrict their practices to particular areas.

This particular sex worker was drawn by Wenzel Hollar, who was commissioned for a series of etchings of London prostitutes. She charged her clients 5 shillings – while a skilled artisan could earn around 2 shillings per day.

In the 19th century, female workers worked long hours in cramped and unhealthy conditions for low wage, which is why workshops were given the name 'sweatshops'.

This drawing depicts the Royal Tobacco Factory in Seville, where the original workforce was replaced by an all-female workforce. American inventor Hiram Maxim visited the factory and commented in his bookMy Lifethat: 'about a third of the young women seemed to have a baby to take care of while they were working'.

Whilst women were depicted without children in the drawing, they were actually juggling two jobs at the same time.

Historical accounts of war often focus on men, but women have had a tremendous impact on war efforts. This is not limited to  the 20th century -  in fact, during the American Civil War, more than 500 women fought directly on the battleground, disguised as men.

When the United States entered World War I in 1917, with agriculture one of the largest industries, the Women’s Land Army of America was introduced. By the end of the war over 20,000 young women - popularly known as 'farmerettes' - had been recruited to work on the land.

In World War II, there was a similar pattern of female recruitment, with women taking over work previously carried out by men.

Industrialisation had brought an increased demand for clerical and administrative staff, but also for legal advice and banking facilities, roles which female workers undertook.

Women were also involved in the manufacture of weapons and ammunition, production of day-to-day necessities, agriculture, transport, nursing and policing. Having taken over most of the tasks carried out by men, women were promised a career after the war.

In the end, men returning from the front most often went back to their previous job. Some women found employment in light manufacturing or they worked as secretaries and clerks. If they had trained for a profession, it was usually to become teachers, nurses, or librarians.

In the 19th century, most universities were resistant to accepting female students, particularly in the sciences. Even when they did accept women as students they were often still not entitled to practice their professions.

From the late 1970s onwards, more and more women enrolled on university degree courses in medicine, law, dentistry, architecture, engineering, accountancy and business management.

Nevertheless, in their work, many experienced the glass ceiling effect: an invisible barrier within male-dominated professions that prevents women from achieving the same position as men.

Only in the 21st century can we see some signs of improvement.

In 2017, according to the most recent statistics available from the EU, the number of women studying at university outnumbered men by more than 1.5 million. A century ago female students in universities were a small minority.

Nowadays, there are still many gender disparities, but real change takes time. Raising awareness and supporting women’s rights are the first steps to a flourishing and equal society.

Irish-Australian who set swimming world records

Sarah 'Fanny' Durack was an Irish-Australian swimmer - the first woman to win an Olympic swimming medal.

Born to Irish emigrant parents in Australia, Fanny Durack was lucky that she was not born in Ireland. If she had, she may not have had the opportunity to become a champion. Had her parents had stayed in Ireland, would Fanny Durack have been at the Olympics?

From the 1890s onwards to 1900, Australian states had slowly been rolling out votes for women. In contrast, in Britain and Ireland, the vote was only won in 1918.

However, there were still significant amounts of discrimination and sexism as regards to rights of Australian women, there was still much to be done for the cause of women.

Fanny Durack made her own statement about what she could achieve as a woman, not just by competing professionally as a swimmer, but also with what she was wearing doing so.

Fanny Durack was mostly a self-taught swimmer. By the time she was 17, Fanny Durack won her first state swimming title. Durack clearly had a natural talent for swimming, an athlete who was born at just the right time to shine.

For the first time ever in the history of the Olympics, the 1912 Games - held in Stockholm, Sweden - allowed women to compete in swimming. Women had only been allowed to participate in the Olympics since 1900, swimming and diving had only been added in 1912.

2,408 athletes participated in the 1912 Olympics and only 48 of them were women - just 2%.

The Australian public were endlessly proud of Durack.

A campaign was started to get her to the 1912 Olympics. Numerous local and international publications wrote about the 'water-nymph' who should represent Australasia in the Olympic Games.

However, women were banned from competing in events where men were also present. By this point Durack had 56 medals and 100 trophies to her name. Thanks to public appeal, along with her formidable record, the ban was lifted and Fanny Durack was allowed to compete in Stockholm.

Arriving in Stockholm, Durack shocked the crowd by donning a sleek, close-fitting swim suit instead of the usual modest and ‘appropriate’ woolen swimsuit.

Not caring whether her outfit was ‘decent’ enough for a woman to be wearing at the time, Durack argued that the heavy clothing she was encouraged to wear had 'as much drag as a sea-anchor'.

Fanny Durack rebelled against societal standards for women at the Olympics when she wore that suit for the 100m freestyle event. And it paid off. She became the first woman to ever win the Olympic gold medal in swimming, not just for Australia but in the world.

Between 1912 and 1918, Fanny Durack broke 12 world records.

Just a week before Durack was due to travel to the 1920s Antwerp Olympics, she was stricken with appendicitis. She had an emergency appendectomy and subsequently contracted both typhoid fever and pneumonia.

By 1921, due to her health, Fanny Durack retired from competitive swimming in January 1921. She dedicated herself to coaching children and lived until 1956. Fanny Durack was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1967.

She had a massive impact on the perception of women athletes, not just in Australia, but across the world. Fanny Durack was a champion who very much blazed a glorious trail for every female Olympians who came after her.

African-American philosopher and author combatting racism, sexism and homophobia

Angela Davis is a political activist, philosopher and author who has continuously pushed for changes in the US prison system. Her work has been admired in East Germany and other communist nations, but she was once regarded by the FBI as a terrorist.

Angela Davis was born in Alabama in 1944. Like other African-Americans of her time, she grew up witnessing racism: the Klu Klux Klan carried out terrorist attacks on Black communities in her neighbourhood in Birmingham.

She attended a segregated black elementary school and was involved in the girls scouts. As a scout, she would march and protest racial segregation in Birmingham. Her mother was a leading organiser of the Southern Negro Youth Congress which, influenced by the Communist Party, aimed at building alliances between African Americans in the South.

Her encounters with systematic racism shaped her political views. Her family was involved in communist and leftist circles which, in turn, led her to become a member of the US Communist Party.

She encountered Herbert Marcus - the Frankfurt School philosopher - while she was studying at Brandeis University in Massachusetts and became a student of his. In her second year at Brandeis, she majored in French while continuing her studies of philosopher and writer Jean-Paul Sartre. The course included a year living in France - in Biarritz and Paris.

In 1963, in Birmingham, Alabama, members of the Ku Klux Klan bombed a church killing four girls and injuring more. Angela Davis knew the victims personally.

Upon her return back to the US, she made plans to attend the University of Frankfurt to continue her interests in philosophy.

While she was studying in Germany, her roommates were active in the Socialist German Student Union which she participated in as well. During her two years there, she learnt of the formation of the Black Panther Party in the US.

She traveled to London in 1967 to attend a conference entitled ‘The Dialectics of Liberation’ where activists such as Trinidadian-American Stokely Carmichael and British Michael X were also present. Davis is said to have been disappointed by their rejection of communism as a ‘white man’s thing’.

In 1971, Angela Davis was on trial and held at a Women’s Detention Centre for ‘aggravated kidnapping and first degree murder in the death of Judge Harold Haley’. The judge had been prosecuting three African-American inmates, known as the Soledad Brothers, charged with murdering a white prison guard at Soledad Prison. Davis’ gun was found on one of the inmate’s brothers who had gained control of the courtroom, armed the defendants, and took the judge, prosecutor and jurors as hostages. The Soledad Brothers and the judge were killed during the commotion.

In the US and internationally, thousands of people organised a movement to gain her release. John Lennon and Yoko Ono contributed to the campaign with their song ‘Angela’.

In Europe, Communist Eastern bloc countries coordinated solidarity campaigns with the slogan ‘Freedom for Angela’. Students would send postcards with roses to the US demanding her freedom.

On June 4, 1972, the all-white jury ruled that she was not guilty. Though she owned the guns used in the crime, she had no role in the crime.

In September 1972, she visited East Germany, where she delivered a speech denouncing American racism and praised the German Democratic Republic and USSR. In communist nations, she became a symbol of anti-imperialist resistance. But, considering her stand on the US prison system, political prisoners who were oppressed by socialist dictatorships also hoped for her solidarity in supporting their causes, which they did not find.

Today, she is still remembered by many in Germany. An exhibition currently at the Kunsthalle im Lipsiusbau in Dresden called1 Million Roses for Angela Davishighlights her role in the Eastern Bloc through photographs, sound installations, sculptures, videos and conceptual works.

She continues to be a major figure in the prison abolition movement, advocating for social efforts on education and community building in solving social problems handled by state punishment. She has stated that she is a vegan and, for her contributions to humanity and the planet, she was awarded the 2011 Blue Planet Award.

Davis came out as a lesbian in 1997 in Out magazine. She is one of the founders of the African American Agenda 2000, an alliance of black feminists working to combat racism, sexism and homophobia.

‘Feminism involves so much more than gender equality and it involves so much more than gender.... it has to involve a consciousness of capitalism and racism and colonialism and post-colonialities, and ability and more genders than we can even imagine and more sexualities than we ever thought we could name.' — Angela Davis

Femininity as encounter of technology and sensuality in the 1920s and 1930s

In fashion, the end of the 1920s and above all the 1930s are regarded as years of body-hugging, unashamedly seductive silhouettes.

These are the years offemme fatales, in which divas such as Jean Harlow and Bette Davis become models of strong and fascinating femininity. Their fame also came from the kind of dresses they were immortalised in, either on and off the screen.

The curvaceous silhouettes they became known for came from a technical intuition: instead of being cut following the straight line of the weave, the flowing fabrics of their dresses were literally 'cut on the grain', with the pattern positioned at a 45° angle on the woven fabric, exploiting its elasticity.

This technique became known as 'bias cut'. It allowed the creation of dresses that could be draped - recalling the iconic peplums worn by goddesses in classical depictions - and sewn as to cling to the natural curves of women's bodies, without constricting it or using under-structures to redesign it.

The designer most associated with the bias cut - considered a sort of architectural approach to dress - isMadeleine Vionnet.

The daughter of an officer from the Jura region of France, always on the move, Madeleine Vionnet was abandoned by her mother when she was still a child. After some wanderings with her father, she settled in Aubervilliers, near Paris, she left school at the age of ten and started working for amaison de couturewhere the wife of a friend of her father worked. After marrying at eighteen, she moved to England, where she worked for Kate Reilly, a dressmaker to the English court. Then she moved back to Paris, where she came into contact with Madame Gerber, one of the three sisters of the maison Callot Soeurs, and actually began her career in the Parisian Haute Couture system.

In 1912, Madeleine Vionnet established her own Maison in Paris. The clothing she made attracted the attention of many for their apparently simple and natural design. The way she used fabrics caused dresses to cling to the body and gently fall caressing the feminine curves.

Some say she invented the bias-cut, applying a technique previously used for cutting collars to the construction of the whole dress.

Vionnet also started a campaign for the protection of couture designs, to prevent copyists from plagiarising her work.

In her quest against plagiarism, Madeleine Vionnet had previously founded the Association for the Defence of Fine and Applied Arts in 1921. However, she eventually started to document her creations by photographing them from the front, back and sides and then decided to stamp on each label her irreproducible and unique fingerprint.

As well as protecting her creativity, marking the clothes in this way put her own identity as a guarantee of their authenticity: an awareness that seemed to stem from the apparently simple but highly-skilled cut of her creations.

How Saint Patrick explained the holy trinity

It's a symbol of Ireland known all over the world, but many people may not know why the shamrock has come to be associated with Ireland.

Loved by the Irish and Irish diaspora, as well as anyone celebrating Saint Patrick's Day, the shamrock is a symbol of Ireland, worn on clothes and seen on objects.

Not to be confused with a lucky four leaf clover, the shamrock has three leaves - which are key to the reason that the shamrock is now a symbol of Ireland.

Saint Patrick is now known as the patron saint ofIreland, but he in fact was not Irish. He was born somewhere in Roman Britain, but scholars are divided as to where. He lived in the fifth century, and arrived in Ireland as a slave having been captured by pirates.

He was captive for six years, during which he converted to Christianity. He eventually left Ireland, studying further in Britain and France. He eventually returned to Ireland as a missionary, wishing to convert and baptise the pagan Irish to Christianity.

It is said that, as part of his missionary work, Saint Patrick used a shamrock.

Explaining the Holy Trinity - where God, Jesus and the Holy Spirt are three persons in one god - Saint Patrick used the shamrock as a metaphor - which has three leaves in one leaf.

The shamrock is a type of clover, although botanists and the public are divided on which species of clover exactly is a shamrock. None of these species are unique to Ireland - they all grow across Europe.

The word shamrock derives from the Irishseamróg, which is a diminutive of seamair óg meaning "young clover".

Ireland's association with the shamrock grew from the 18th century onwards, in a similar way to other associations like a rose for England, a thistle for Scotland and a daffodil for Wales.

Shamrocks, in particular, have been celebrated in traditional Irish music.

So the next time you see a bunch of shamrocks on Saint Patrick's Day, you'll now know where the tradition comes from.

Archive photographs from a girls school in Dublin

Many of us remember playing sport in our schooldays. Some of us may remember it fondly, and some may never want to repeat the experience again.

School sport lessons can be a time to try out a variety of sports, when a school offers these. It can also be a time where longer sport careers or hobbies begin.

Today we're going to explore a set of archive photographs which have been shared by the Rathdown School Archive via ourEuropeana Sport contribution website.

Rathdown Schoolis a day and boarding school for girls upto 18 in south County Dublin in Ireland. It was established in 1973 following the merger of three schools: Park House School, The Hall School and Hillcourt School. A further school Glengara Park School was amalgated in 1987.

The archive photographs come from all of these schools. They span several decades, dating as far back as 1916, as shown in the First XI hockey photograph below. The 1920 photograph shows Hillcourt girls playing hockey on their famously sloping grass pitch.

The school has always had a wide range of sports on offer - from hockey to riding, swimming to athletics. Park House was an enthusiastic pioneer of fencing for girls and it continued at Rathdown after the 1973 merger.

The Hall, Hillcourt, and Glengara Park were all early adopters of lacrosse in the 1920s. Pictured below are Glengara Park’s Firsts, winning the Schools Lacrosse Shield in 1947. Lacrosse in more recent years has suffered a decline in popularity in girls’ schools, but it was revived at Rathdown in 2019, thanks to Ireland Lacrosse.

Hillcourt School, on whose campus Rathdown now operates, advertised itself as being 20 minutes' walk from the sea at Dun Laoghaire (or Kingstown, as it was then known). Girls were regularly marched down the hill in all weathers, to the baths on the seafront which had seawater and freshwater pools, as well as seaweed and hot seawater baths.

In this photograph, Miss Gresham, in a bathing suit and hat, is poised to jump or dive off a projecting board, while other swimmers have clustered out of her way at the bottom of the steps. In the background, you can see the changing rooms, with towels strung up.

The Hall girls were also lucky enough to be within walking distance of the sea, at Seapoint, where another set of baths featured high and low diving boards, and benches for spectators, making an ideal spot for the annual swimming gala against the backdrop of Dublin Bay. Pictured here is Lucinda Dockrell diving at the 1960 swimming gala.

Tennis was popular with all the girls, and was played in all of the schools, originally, of course, all on grass.

Sports lessons today may be very different to those of the past. However, despite all the changes between then and now, it's heartening to see that some things always stay the same - this photograph show rain stopping Sports Day in 1957.

Role model for generations of artists, bisexual women and people with disabilities

Renowned Mexican artist Frida Kahlo was a role model for generations of artists, bisexual women and people with disabilities. Her works were inspired by nature and explored gender, disability, class, post-colonialism and race in Mexican society.

Frida Kahlo was born on 6 July 1907 on the outskirts of Mexico city in Coyoacán.

Her father, who was a photographer, had migrated from Germany after an epilepsy-induced accident that ended his university studies. Her mother was of mixed European and Indigenous descent.

When Kahlo was six, she contracted polio which led to her right leg being shorter and thinner than her left leg. Due to her being isolated for months and bullied, she became reclusive. This also brought her closer to her father, as they both shared experiences of living with disability.

She was motivated by her father to play sports to regain her strength despite the fact that physical activities were seen as mostly suitable for men. From her father, she learned about nature, literature, philosophy and photography - she would help him develop photographs.

In 1922, Kahlo was accepted  to the National Preparatory School, an elite school which had only just began to admit women.

During her time there, she became deeply engaged in Mexican culture, social justice issues and political activism. The school promoted Indigenismo - taking pride in the country's indigenous heritage and seeking to overturn the colonial mindset that Europe was superior to Mexico.

On 17 September 1925, a bus accident left Kahlo with many injuries including serious damage to her spine and pelvis. She was confined to bed for three months. The accident led to her suffering from chronic pain for the rest of her life.

Though she had enjoyed art from an early age and had worked as a paid engraving apprentice to help her family, she had not yet considered a career as an artist and was focused on becoming a doctor. After the accident, she contemplated a career as a medical illustrator combining her love of science and art.

During her bed-ridden months, her parents provided her with equipment to paint in bed and a mirror so she could see herself. Painting became a way for her to explore questions around identity and existence. She painted herself, her sisters and school friends.

‘*I paint myself because I am often alone and I am the subject I know best.*’

After her bedrest was over by late 1927, Kahlo started socialising again. She attended a party in 1928 where she met her future husband Diego Rivera, who was a well-known artist at the time.

After marrying Rivera, they moved to the Spanish-style city of Cuernavacas. Kahlo started wearing more traditional indigenous Mexican clothing to emphasise her mixed indigenous heritage. The clothes were a way for her to express her feminist and anti-colonial ideals.

Kahlo and Rivera moved to the US in 1930, where she continued to experience health problems throughout her time there and upon her return to Mexico.

Kahlo paintedThe Broken Column(1944), after she had spinal surgery to correct ongoing problems she suffered since the accident. In the self portrait, her body is open down the middle revealing an Ionic column, a medical metal corset around her body and nails nailed into her skin, with tears dripping down her cheeks.

InTree of Hope, Remain Strong(1946), Kahlo paints two versions of herself: the right, she is laying on a medical bed with an open gash down her back and across her pelvis. The left, she is in a red dress holding her medical corset and a sign that says ‘Tree of Hope, Remain Strong.’Wounded Deer(1946) also reflects her physical state and deterioration of her physical health. She also represents herself as male and female which some scholars believe was a reflection of her bisexuality.

During Kahlo and Diego Rivera, they both had extra-marital affairs.

She had affairs with both men and women, including movie stars Dolores del Rio, Paulette Goddard, Maria Felix and movie star Georgia O'Keeffe amongst others. Her paintingTwo Nudes in a Forest(1939) is said to reflect her attraction towards women.

Towards the end of her life, photographer Lola Alvarez Bravo staged Kahlo’s first solo exhibition in Mexico at Galeria Arte Contemporaneo in 1953. Kahlo ordered her bed to be moved to the gallery so she could attend the opening. She arrived in an ambulance and was carried on a stretcher to her bed where she stayed throughout the party. The exhibition received attention from press around the world and was a significant cultural event in Mexico.

A year later, on 13 July 1954, aged just 47, she died.

In 1984, Mexico declared her work as national cultural heritage, and she is considered to be one of the most instantly recognisable artists. She has become an icon for several minority groups and political movements, including feminists, LGBTQ community and Chicanos.

The first Swede to hit the US charts

Swedish musicians and singers have been topping the charts all over the world from the past few decades - from ABBA and Ace of Base to Zara Larsson. However, in the 1950s, one singer - Siw Malmkvist - was the first Swede to have a hit record on the US charts.

Malmkvist's career began in the 1950s when she won a talent show. Since then, she has gone on to have a successful career as a singer and artist across Europe. She has recorded around 600 songs in ten languages - Swedish, English, Finnish, Norwegian, Danish, German, Dutch, French, Italian and Spanish.

Born in Skåne County in southern Sweden, Malmkvist grew up in anorphanage, the youngest of a family of eight children.

Aged 18, she won a talent competition semi-final in Skane, and then competed in the final in Stockholm, which she also won. This led to her first record and being signed by the record company Metronome.

As an actress, she has played many roles on stage in plays and musicals and in films. Among her roles, she has performed in the musicals Cabaret, Nine and as Pippi Longstocking in a musical adaptation of the children's book by the Astrid Lindgren.

In 1964, she was the first Swede to have a hit on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, when "Sole Sole Sole" (a duet with Italian singer Umberto Marcato), entered the chart, peaking at No. 58.

In the early 1960s, Malmkvist was launched in Germany.

One of her first songs released there reached number 4 in the charts. Her song Liebeskummer lohnt sich nicht reached number 1 in 1964. She has since gone on to have a succesful career in Germany, where she is one of the most popular foreign artists.

She entered the Eurovision Song Contest twice. In 1960, the Contest was held in London; Malmkvist came 10th with the song 'Alla andra får varann'.

The following year, along with singer Gunnar Wiklund, she won the Swedish selection Melodifestivalen with the song April, April. But she didn't go to the international competition in Cannes - another singer (Lill-Babs) was selected instead.

Malmkvist returned to the Eurovision Song Contest in 1969, singing not for Sweden but for (West) Germany. Her song Primadonna came 9th.

In 2016, Malmkvist was elected to the Swedish Music Hall of Fame reflecting on a long and successful career. Even today - aged 84 - Malmkvist continues to sing and perform in Sweden.

In the 19th century, when Queen Victoria was on the throne, another woman was governing a world power on the opposite side of the globe: Empress Dowager Cixi.

In Bernardo Bertolucci’s movieThe Last Emperor(1987), emperor-to-be Puyi, 2 years old, facedCixiat her deathbed, when she announced that he would become the next emperor of China. The scene holds historical truth, depicting the last political act of a woman who had held the reins of the country for half a century.

The story of Yehenala (Cixi’s birth name) started out like a fairy tale.

Born in 1835, she stemmed from a noble family of Manchurians, the ethnic group that had been ruling China for nearly two centuries. As a teenager, she was chosen as a concubine toEmperor Xianfeng, who took notice of her because of her cleverness. In 1856, she and her husband had their only son and heirTongzhi, and she was elevated from concubine to consort.

By that time, the mighty empire of China had begun its downfall. Internally, the Manchurian power was eroded by famines, natural disasters, financial problems and revolts.

From the outside, China was under fire as well, as exemplified by the disastrous opium wars against Great Britain (1839-1842) and France (1856-1860), ending with the destruction of theOld Summer Palace in Beijing.

Moreover, China was forced to sign the so-calledUnequal treaty, to open up its harbours to foreign merchants and to give Hong Kong to Great Britain.

The next blow was the death of Emperor Xianfeng in 1861.

At the time, his rightful heir Tongzhi was just 5 years old, thus a regency was established. His mother Cixi seized the opportunity along with Xianfeng's official wife to take control.

Henceforth, she would be known as 'Empress Dowager Cixi' (慈禧) and, throughout the next decades, ruled China as a co-regent, taking decisions and using the imperial seal on behalf of her son.

When Tonghzi finally succeeded to the throne in 1873, his reign would prove to be exceptionally short, succumbing to illness just 2 years later.

Cixi elected her nephew Guangxu, who was only 3 at the time, as the next emperor. After the death of Empress Dowager Ci’an, Cixi became China's sole regent. She continued to use the underaged emperor as her puppet until he married and was installed on the throne in 1889.

The Empress Dowager retired shortly after, yet there would be no smooth sailing for Cixi just yet.

When the emperor attempted theHundred days’ Reformin 1898, the conservatives and Cixi reacted with a coup. The emperor was put under arrest for the rest of his life.

When Guangxu eventually died in 1908, Cixi chose the son of her nephew’s brother, little Puyi, as a successor. By appointing a child once again, she thought she could continue to rule China. Yet she passed away only 24 hours later.

The glorious tale of the Chinese empire was now nearing its end as four years later Qing dynasty officials forced the abdication of Puyi. The end of the Chinese imperial era opened a new chapter in the history of the country: the Republic of China.

Cixi not only left her mark on China's political history but also on the country’s culture and society.

One of her passions wasPeking opera: a mix of theatre, music, song and incredible acrobatics, that was in the midst of its golden age during her reign. In the imperial palaces, Cixi had special theatres built with complex machinery. One of the greatest honours a courtier could experience was to receive an invitation to attend a performance there.

Cixialso was an architecture enthusiast.

She supervised the construction of the New Summer Palace. The funds she spent on such large-scale projects, however, were originally intended for the modernisation of the state.

A famous example was the abuse of money meant to modernise the imperial fleet. Instead of acquiring new battleships, Cixi used the resources to erect aMarble Boaat the Summer Palace, to allow for the enjoyment of beautiful views and fresh lakeside air. Yet modernisation it was not: the only unusual trait of the boat were the two fake paddles, added to make it look like a western ship.

Contrary to what might be expected, the conservative Empress Dowager appreciated styles and inventions that infused the court with a western flavour. Cixi liked clocks and cosmetics and even had a telephone line installed at the Summer Palace.

She loved to receive gifts: some courtiers saw this as an opportunity to show her the necessity of modernisation.

As a consequence, a small railway was built to transport her from the Forbidden City to the Summer Palace. She was also gifted a car but never used it - the idea of sitting behind a chauffeur was considered disrespectful.

Cixi also understood the importance of photography to support her public image.

In 1903 and 1904, a series of portraits were made by Xunling: son to the Chinese ambassador in Paris and brother of Cixi’s first lady-in-waiting,Princess Der Ling. These pictures, of which several have been included in the album of French traveller Firmin Laribe, remain as a great testimony of the Qing court life.

Cixi has been a fascinating character, from the time of her reign up to the present.

Many a myth concerning her roots, her life, rumoured cruel behaviour and even sexual acts with eunuchs and actors has come to fruition. Some of these tales, along with genuine biographic facts, have inspired a range of publications and other products, from novels and comics to tv series and films.

And so the legend continues, as the kaleidoscope of perspectives on this intriguing figure keeps on turning. Champion of the arts, sharp-minded strategist, gravedigger of a mighty empire: views on Cixi will never cease to evolve, but she will always remain one of the most powerful women in world history.

Meet the authors and illustrators who brought the fairy tale to life

Many of us are familiar with the fairy taleBeauty and the Beast- whether from Disney films or childhood memories.

AsBeauty and the Beastis a fairy tale, different versions of the story exist across different European countries and beyond. The first known written version of the story dates to a book published in France in 1740.

This blog will look at a number of female authors and illustrators behind the tale ofBeauty and the Beast.

Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve is the author of the oldest known version of Beauty and the Beast. She was a novelist in 18th century France.

Born in 1685 in Paris, Gabrielle-Suzanne de Villeneuve was a member of a wealthy Protestant family. In 1706, she married Jean-Baptiste Gaalon de Villeneuve, who was from an aristocratic family. Soon after her marriage, she requested a separation of belongings from her husband who had already squandered much of their substantial joint family inheritance.

de Villeneuve published both novels and fairy tales.Beauty and the Beast- La Belle et la Bête - was included in her 1740 bookLa jeune américaine, et les contes marins(The Young American and Marine Tales).

This book is a collection of fairy tales the length of a novel with many interconnected subplots. Her version ofBeauty and the Beastis longer and more detailed than the version we know today.

de Villeneuve was the author of many fairy tale collections and novels. Her novelLa Jardinière de Vincennes(The Gardener of Vincennes) was published in 1753 to great commercial success.

Despite her success, de Villeneuve's version ofBeauty and the Beastis not the commonly known version today. That version of the tale was written by another French author, Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont.

Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont was born in 1711 in Rouen. In 1748, after two marriages, de Beaumont left France to work in London as a governess to wealthy and upper-class families. During her fifteen years living in London, she began to publish books and periodicals on topics relating to children's education.

In 1756 - a year after Gabrielle-Suzanne de Villeneuve's death - de Beaumont published a version of the Beauty and the Beast tale in French in her publicationMagasin des enfants (ou dialogues entre une sage gouvernante et plusieure de ses élèves). The first English language translation was published in 1757.

This version of theBeauty and the Beasttale was shorter and less complex than de Villeneuve's, with less characters. de Beaumont's version made no mention of the previous version by Madame de Villeneuve.

Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont's writing was pedagogical, written with childen in mind. They were instructional handbooks for parents and educators of students from childhood through adolescence, with many versions, revisions and translations published.

She intendedBeauty and the Beastto be a moral tale, along with her other works which showed rewards and punishments and frequently concluded with overtly Christian messages.

Since being published in the 18th century,Beauty and the Beast's has become a much-loved fairy tale - published in many anthologies and books.

One such book wasHans Andersen's Fairy Tales, with beautiful illustrations by Scottish artist Anne Anderson.

Born in 1874, Anderson was known for her illustrations in children's books, particular in an art nouveau style. She contributed to many volumes and books, beloved by children in the early part of the 20th century.

Below you can see Anderson's illustrations for the fairy talesThe Wild Swan,The Snow QueenandThe Real Princess.



The story ofBeauty and the Beasthas been published in many languages around the world.

Dutch writer Tine van Berken is the author of a version of the story calledBella en de Beer(Bella and the Bear).

Tine van Berken was the pseudonym of Anna Christina Berkhout, who also wrote under the name Anna Koubert. She born in the Jordaan neighbourhood of Amsterdam in 1870.

In the 1890s, she began to write and publish books, especially for children, particularly aimed at girls.

In just a few years, she had written more than 10 books, 8 of which were published by 1899. However, that year, her life was tragically cut short when she died - aged just 29 - from tubercolosis.

Clémentine Delait found fame in the early 1900s

Clémentine Delait was a French bearded lady who found fame in the early 20th century, making the most of her physical attributes while playing with notions of gender and creating her own celebrity.

Clémentine Clattaux was born in 1865 in Chaumousey in the Vosges region in eastern France. During her teenage years, she began to develop more hair than usual for a teenage girl, especially on her face.

Such hair growth is a rare but naturally occuring condition, known as hirsutism or hypertrichosis. There can be many causes: from ovarian cysts to medication or other conditions.

Little was known of such hormonal conditions in the 18th cenutury. Bearded women thus challenged people's notions of gender, as well as race.

White women with hair on their faces were questioned on their gender - were they men or women? Black women who had hair on their faces were racistly perceived as evidence of human's evolution from apes.

Many bearded ladies came to public attention as part of circus shows, such as Barnum & Bailey. These shows presented people with naturally occuring conditions as a 'curious collection of freaks', a rather exploitative and unfair way to describe them. This poster from 1899 shows one such bearded lady.

Madame Delait, however, took more control over her image.

In 1900, she visited a carnival and saw a bearded lady, but was not impressed by her stubble. Having shaved her face from an early age, Clémetine Delait and her husband placed a bet that she could grow a better beard.

In 1885, she had established a café in Thaon-les-Vosges with her husband, who was a baker. The beard bet brought many customers to the Delait's cafe, who changed its name toLe Café de La Femme à Barbe(Café of the Bearded Woman).

From then on, she began to wear a curly beard.

In 1904, she received permission from the authorities to wear men's clothes, as it was illegal for women to wear masculine clothing.

Taking advantage of her fame, Delait posed for many photographers who published postcards of Madame Delait, the Bearded Lady. She poses in the photographs, adopting both traditionally feminine and masculine gestures and clothing.

During World War One, she worked for the Red Cross. French soldiers in World War One were known by the nickname Poilu, which means hairy. Madame Delait was perfectly placed to be adopted as a mascot - many postcards featuring her circulated during the conflict.

After World War One, the Delaits adopted a daughter, Fernande whose parents had died in the Spanish flu epidemic. They opened a haberdashery in Plombières-les-Bains.

As her fame become international, Madame Delait was invited to join PT Barnum's circus. She declined, deciding to stay with her husband who suffered from rheumatism. Instead, she travelled around Europe, meeting many famous personalities inlcuding royalty and heads of state.

She became a widow in 1928, thereafter re-opening a bar where she stars in cabaret shows.

In 1934, Madame Delait's memoirs were published, compiled by local journalist Paul Ramber. You can read them here (in French).

Clémentine Delait died in 1939, aged 74. On her gravestone, the text reads,'here lies Clémentine Delait, the Bearded Woman', as she wished.

Known for her distinctive singing style and voice, Eartha Kitt was active in social causes in the 1950s and 1960s

Eartha Kitt was an American singer, actress, activist and dancer known for her distinctive singing style and voice. Her recordings of the songsC'est si bonandSanta Babyreached the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100.

Earth Kitt was born on 17 January 1927 on a cotton plantation near North, a small town in South Carolina. Her mother was of Cherokee and African descent. Though she never knew her father, it was said that he was the son of the owner of the farm she had been born on and was conceived by rape.

Her mother went to live with a man who refused to accept Kitt because of her pale complexion, so she was sent to a relative who abused her. After the death of her mother, she was sent to live in New York with another relative named Mamie Kitt, who might have actually been her biological mother. There, she attended the Metropolitan Vocational High School.

In 1943, she began her career aged 16, as a member of the Katherine Dunham Company, which was named after its founder, who was a dancer and choreographer.

Kitt stayed with the company for five years. With them, she toured the United States, Mexico, South America and Europe. When the company returned to the United States, Eartha decided to stay in Paris, where she became a sensational nightclub singer.

In 1950 she made her acting debut as Helen of Troy in Orsen Welles's adaptation of Faust called Times Run. Her songsC'est Si Bon,Santa Baby,I Want to Be Eviland her appearance in the Broadway revue of Leonard Sillman's New Faces of 1952 made her a star.

She continued to be successful with theatre productions such as Mrs. Paterson, Shinbone Alley, and television appearances, especially for her role as Catwoman in the 1960 series of Batman.

Throughout her career she would continue to appear on Broadway musicals, television and release more songs that would hit the charts. She won an Annie award for her voice as Yzma in the animated filmThe Emperor's New Grooveand continued on for its sequelsKron's New GrooveandThe Emperor's New Schoolfor which she won two Emmy Awards.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Kitt was active in social causes.

She establishedKittsville Youth Foundation, a non profit organisation for underprivileged youth. She also supported 'Rebels with a Cause', a group of youth who establish recreational areas and clean up streets to keep out of trouble. She was also a member of the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom.

She became a vocal supporter of LGBT rights and supported publicly same-sex marriage which she concidered a civil right.

'I support [gay marriage] because we're asking for the same thing. If I have a partner and something happens to me, I want that partner to enjoy the benefits of what we have reaped together. It's a civil-rights thing, isn't it?'

In 1968, during a formal women's lunch at the White House, the First Lady Lady Bird Johnson asked Kitt about the Vietnam War. Kitt replied:'You send the best of this country off to be shot and maimed. No wonder the kids rebel and take pot.'

She further remarked during a question and answer session:

'The children of America are not rebelling for no reason. They are not hippies for no reason at all. We don't have what we have on Sunset Boulevard for no reason. They are rebelling against something. There are so many things burning the people of this country, particularly mothers. They feel they are going to raise sons – and I know what it's like, and you have children of your own, Mrs. Johnson – we raise children and send them to war.'

This caused the First Lady to burst into tears and from there on her career in the United States came to an end. She was branded a ‘sadistic nymphomaniac’ by the CIA, who collected information and comments about her sex life and family history, which got published in the New York Times.

Following this incident, she focused on performances in Europe and Asia.

Eartha Kitt died of colon cancer on Christmas day of 2008, three weeks before her 82nd birthday. Her daughter who was by her side, described her as dying the same way she lived.

'...when she left, she left the world with a bang, she left it how she lived it. She screamed her way out of here, literally. I truly believe her survival instincts were so part of her DNA that she was not going to go quietly or willingly.'

Olympic gold medallist who survived the Holocaust and lived through the 1956 Hungarian Revolution

Hungarian swimmer Éva Székely was an Olympic gold medallist who survived the Holocaust and lived through the 1956 Hungarian Revolution.

Born in Budapest in April 1927, Székely was a swimmer from a young age. Seeing fellow Hungarian Ferenc Csik win the 100m freestyle race at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin made her determined to swim competitively.

In her youth, she was a member of a local swim team. During World War II, in 1941, she was expelled from the team because she was Jewish, as well as being excluded from competitions until the war ended.

Székely was very nearly killed during a roundup of Jewish people by in Budapest in winter 1944.

WATCH:Interview with Éva Székely at USC Shoah Foundation

In the video, she explains how, when threatened by a young Nazi, she was spared her at the last minute due to her father's quick thinking by saying that she was the Hungarian swimming champion.

After the war, her swimming career resumed and she went from strength to strength, winning gold medals in multiple races at the Hungarian swimming championships every year from 1945 to 1956. She set many national records in this time, as well as six world records.

She competed in the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, winning gold in the 200 metre breaststroke.

She returned to the Olympics 4 years later in Melbourne. During these 1956 Olympics, the Hungarian revolution broke out while they were away. Szekely’s daughter was still in Hungary, and despite her concern, she still competed and won silver in the 200 metre breaststroke.

The following year, Szekely, her husband and daughter, defected to the United States but returned to Hungary later to look after her parents. Szekely’s husband Dezső Gyarmati was a water player - after their return, the authorities only allowed one of the couple to go to the 1960 Olympics in Rome. Her husband competed, with Székely retiring from competitive swimming in 1960.

Afterwards, Székely worked as a pharmacist and swimming coach, training among other her daughter Andrea Gyarmati who won two medals at the 1972 Olympics in Munich.

In later life, Székely spoke openly, with courage and determination, of her experiences during World War II as a Jewish athlete. Éva Székely died in February 2020, aged 92.

Multicultural theatre company inspiring new generations of performers

For nearly 30 years, the Nordic Black Theatre in Oslo has been presenting multicultural theatre to entertain and inform audiences while developing new Norwegian theatre talent.

TheNordic Black Theatrewas founded in Oslo in 1992 with the aim of diversifying Norwegian theatre.

It was founded by actor, director and playwright Cliff Moustache and Jarl Solberg. Solberg managed the theatre's day-to-day activities while Moustache was the artistic director.

Moustache was born in The Seychelles, and had studied acting and directing in the United Kingdom. He moved to Norway in the 1980s, becoming the director of a theatre group Artists for Libertation.

Moustache has noted that, in the 1990s, 'theatre in Oslo was not promoting the wealth and dynamism of multiculturalism'. There were little professional opportunities for Black actors, with some Norwegian theatres still using make-up so white actos could play Black roles.

Initially the theatre was located in the Park Theatre, in Oslo's Grünerløkka district.

In 2001, the theatre company moved to be located on a boat 'Innvik'.

The boat was originally built in 1967 as a car ferry, but had been converted into a theatre space in 1987. It had been used by many different theatre and cultural groups for performances, poetry readings, concerts and more - as well as offering accommodation.

However, in 2010, the old car ferry was declared a fire hazard. Nordic Black Theatre had to move to a new venue, after around 100,000 audience members had enjoyed 1,500 performances on board.

From 2010, the Nordic Black Theatre has been based in Caféteateret in the Gamle Oslo district.

The Nordic Black theatre both stages its own productions as well as guest performances from other theatre companies.

The Nordic Black Theatre has been at the forefront of developing new theatre talent in Norway. Through groups and activities for children and teenagers, the theatre has recruited generations of new and younger voices into performing arts.

The photographs below are from the collections of the Oslo City Archive, examples of many productions and activities of the Nordic Black Theatre.

Patrice Lumumba

Mariama Bâ

Fela Kuti

Vocalising against oppression

Between the late 1940s and 1970s, many African countries were shifting from colonialism towards anti colonial revolutions and independence.

In the Belgian Congo (later named Democratic Republic of Congo), Senegal and Nigeria,  Patrice Lumumba, Mariama Ba and Fela Kuti have each contributed, influenced and shaped their respective countries by vocalising the oppressive systems their societies were dealing with.

Following World War II, across Africa, young leaders were working towards independence from colonial powers. Patrice Lumumba became the leader of the Congolese National Movement political party, which he helped found in 1958.

The party gained popularity because it did not speak towards any one particular ethnic group and promoted independence, neutrality in foreign affairs, gradual Africanisation of the government and state-led economic development.

A Congolese Round Table Conference was held in Brussels between January and May 1960. There, the future of the Belgian Congo was discussed between the Congolese political class and Belgian politicians and businessmen. The Belgian delegation were not expecting unity across Congolese party lines and underestimated their discontent. With 30 June 1960 set as the independence date, national elections were held in May, with Lumumba’s political party winning.

After independence, an army rebellion broke out, which was the beginning of the Congo Crisis. Lumumba called on the United States and the United Nations for help to repress the Belgian-supported Katangan state separation from Congo. Both refused, so Lumumba turned to the Soviet Union for support.

Lumumba was imprisoned then executed in a coup supported by Belgian authorities, the United Nations, the United States and Britain on 17 January 1961. After his assissination, he was seen as a martyr for the Pan-African movement. Belgium formally apologised for its role in the assassination in 2002.

Mariama Bâ was an influential writer and a women's rights advocate born in 1929 in Dakar, Senegal during the French occupation.

She was born into a wealthy family of Lebu ethnicity. Her paternal grandfather was an interpreter for French officials in Saint-Louis, before coming to Dakar. Her father became the first Senegalese Minister of Health in 1956.

As her mother died early in her life, her maternal grandparents took charge of her care. She attended Koranic school and was educated in French due to her father's interest. Her grandparents didn't believe in girls receiving formal education but, upon her father's insistence, she was enrolled into a French language school in Dakar which would later be named after Berthe Maubert whom she studied with.

In 1947, she became a teacher and married politician Obeye Diop whom she later divorced. Some sources claim she had nine children with Diop, while others claim her marriage to Diop was her third marriage and they had five children together.

Nonetheless, it was after her divorce that she raised her children alone and started becoming involved in women's associations, promoting education and women's rights.

In 1979 Mariama Bâ wroteUne si longue lettre (So long a letter).

The novel is in the form of letters and covers the life of Senegalese women during the 1970s and 1980s, community life, Islam and polygamy, and death rituals. It explores the strains between the main character Ramatoulaye's feminist values (developed mostly because of her French colonial education) and her religion, often used as a means of justifying the mistreatment of women. Nonetheless, Ramatoulaye attributes the mistreatment of women by men to the misinterpretation of Islamic scriptures, rather than the scriptures being inherently sexist.

The novel was a great critical and public success - she won the Noma prize for publication in Africa at the Frankfurt Book Fair in 1980.

Her second novelUn chant écarlate (Scarlet Letter), published in 1981 after her death, also gained international attention. The novel is about a marriage between a French woman and a Senegalese man. It explores cross-cultural marriage, the tyranny of tradition and the need for women to create empowering spaces for themselves.

In her third book, also published in 1981,La fonction politique des littératures Africaines écrites (The Political Function of African Written Literatures), Mariama Bâ declares that every African woman contributes to Africa's development and growth.

Mariama Bâ is considered one of the pioneers in Senegalese literature, and her novelUne si longue lettreis taught in Senegalese secondary education.

President Leopold Sedar Sengor creat a girls boarding school on the island of Gorée was and named it after her while she was alive in 1977, as a tribute to her work and what she stood for.

Afrobeat pioneer musician Fela Kuti was born in 1938 in Abeokuta in Nigeria, at that time a British colony.

As the son of Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti, a feminist and activist in the anti-colonial movement, he began to vocalise the hardship and the life of the everyday Nigerian people through his music from the late 1960s onwards.

His music was a mix of jazz, funk, Ghanaian highlife, psychedelic rock and traditional rhythms and chants which founded Afrobeat. Singing in Pidgin English, his music was widely understood throughout the continent and beyond.

In 1969 he travelled to the USA, and inspired by the Black Power movement, shifted his musical themes from love to social issues.

His music was extremely critical of the Nigerian government which would see him imprisoned many times. His songs were inspired by the realities of corruption and socio-economic inequality in Africa.

In 1977, he released the album Zombie - an attack on Nigerian soldiers using the zombie metaphor to describe the methods of the Nigerian military.

The album was a hit which angered the government, setting off an attack against Fela’s commune called the Kalakuta Republic. His mother died in the event which led him to create the songsCoffin for Head of StateandUnknown Soldieras well as send her coffin to the military general.

In the 80s he released a song with his band Egypt'80 titledBeasts of No Nation, an anti-apartheid composition with U.S. President Ronald Reagan, UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, and South African State President Pieter Willem Botha on its cover.

By the 1990s, military corruption in Nigeria worsened as well as Kuti's health. Fela Kuti died of AIDS in 1997 and more than one million people attended his funeral.

A poem Creole from Guadeloupe

Literature in Twi and poetry in Ewe from Ghana

A song in Xhosa from South Africa

Languages evolve and change over time. Their beauty lies in the countless similarities and differences that tell our stories and make cultures rich. History shows that ruling powers, through laws and educational systems, dictated what languages, dialects and accents should be seen as favourable or mandatory.

When you come from a place where your country's official language has been imposed through colonisation and your mother tongue is seen as secondary or even tertiary, a mixed feeling towards preservation and pride or even inferiority can manifest in different ways.

This blog takes a looks at languages from Guadeloupe, Ghana and South Africa - places with a history of European colonisation - through poetry, literature and music in an effort to show appreciation and take a glimpse through different eyes.

Kréyòl

Creole

Creole is my languageWhy do they want to practice you just to say dirty words?Why are you considered as a language which has no class?....

Creole is my languageWithout rejecting French, I want you to have your placeBecause I am more comfortable with youCreole is my language

This is an extract fromKréyòlby Éric Amiens written in 1985, addressing societal attitudes at the time towards speaking Creole.

To hear what Guadeloupe Creole sounds like, listen to thetale of Totoron Europeana.

...Mo yɛ a meremma. Yie, obi se hwɛ ne ti, ma me nwane. Ah! Meome rete oo obi rentwa mu ha? Afei deɛ mɛba. Ɔtwe bɛbrɛ na  ɔbɔmɔfoɔ nso bɛbrɛ yie. Biribi awɔ m’atikɔ. Ɛdeɛn na awɔ m'atikɔ ama mapue yi?  Ɛyɛ me ahi nti mɛsu.

WHAT'S ALL THIS?

...I can decide not to come. Look at his head, said one of them, let me run. Ah, no one passes by here? I have to come this time around. Just as the antelope will be tired, so will the hunter also get very tired. Something has hit my occipital region.

What at all could hit the back of my head for me to pop out like this? It hurts so I’ll cry.

This is an incident that occurred one Thursday in 1950 at Maame Ayensua’s single room which she had been refurbishing beautifully...

This is an extract from ASƐM BƐN NI? in Twi by Bilobi Delphina Jentina Asaaseyaa, published in 2015 - a narration of a baby in her mother's womb in a home made labour room with a local nurse and a man present.

To hear what Twi sounds like, listen to a song calledOde adure aye meon Europeana.

Ewe can be heard in a spoken word performance called Mↄkpↄkpↄ (Hope) by Ghanaian artist Fafanyo The Pryme.

Fafanyo The Pryme reveals that the poem starts calling out evil spirits, acknowledging their existence and how we decide if they affects our lives since we have stronger spirits within us. One of the things or the spirits we have in us is hope, which keeps us even if we are in darkness or in the midst of these evil spirit or whatever challenges we find ourselves in.

'I didn't literally mean evil spirits but I used that as a metaphor for the things that wear us out and put us at the verge of giving up.

The idea is to make Hope a spiritual thing, which I think it is because within us is the very capability to overcome anything at all and the key to that is Hope. Only if we do not sleep and slip into death, we can fight on and get to our desired destination and expectations if we are strong enough.'

Qongqothwane is a traditional wedding song of the Xhosa people of South Africa. It is sung for good fortune.

The witch doctor gives Xhosa's newly-weds good blessings and advice for the future. Children play with knocking beetles, and they are said to lead them home. The witch doctor is like the beetle, he leads the newlyweds to a new future together in a similar way as the beetle leads children home to where they belong.

The song has been made internationally famous by Xhosa singer Miriam Makeba and is widely known as 'The Click Song'.

Transatlantic perspectives on American abolitionist and anti-slavery campaigner

The name Frederick Douglass is known around the world today, synonymous with the abolition of slavery in the United States.

Frederick Douglas was born in Maryland in February 1818. His birthname was Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey, and he was born into slavery.

His childhood and adolescence were shaped by slavery: he was separated from his family, educational opportunities were denied to him, he was whipped and beaten.

In 1838, Douglass escaped, travelling via train, steam-ferry and safe-houses to New York City, and later settled in Massachusetts. This began a new chapter in Douglass' life in which he became a noted abolitionist, speaker and social campaigner.

Douglass wrote several autobiographies, detailing his life and experiences. The most-known of this isNarrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slavewhich was first published in the United States in 1845.

Within a few years, it was published in Europe, and had been translated into Dutch and French.

A number of Douglass's autobiographies can be found on Europeana - Narrative of the life of Frederick Douglass isavailable in English, along with aGerman translationofMy Bondage, My Freedom.

In the wake of its publication, Douglass travelled to Europe. He visited the United Kingdom and Ireland, with thousands of speaking engagements in dozens of cities and towns.

In all, Douglass spent nineteen months on this tour. He remarked that he was treated not 'as a colour, but as a man' there. In Ireland - where his visit coincided with the Irish Famine - he said that, 'I seem to have undergone a transformation, I live a new life'.

Today, this journey to Europe is remembered by a number of commemorations.

The websiteFrederick Douglass in Britain and Irelandby Dr Hannah-Rose Murray details all of Douglass' speaking engagements and events, as well as those of other abolitionists.

Plaques in both Ireland and the United Kingdom remember his visit, as well as websites, events and festivals, some of which are listed here:

All of these commemorations ensure that the Frederick Douglass' legacy of abolitionsim, social reform and justice remains into the 21st century.

Jewish immigrant Rosenbaum ran a drapery store in Sundsvall for decades

Jewish people have lived in Sweden for centuries. This blog explores Salamon Rosenbaum who owned a fashion store for decades in Sundsvall, a city in northern Sweden.

The history of the Jewish minority in Sweden started in 1774 when the first group of Jewish immigrants came from Northern Germany.

They mostly worked as merchants and manufacturers. The Swedish king welcomed them because they had valuable contacts and 'know how'. The legislation at the time obliged people to convert to Protestantism to stay in the country, but the king made an exception. In 1779, this legislation was abolished to be replaced by the Jewish Ordinance which, between 1782 and 1838, decided where Jews could live and which occupations they could have.

During the second half of the 1800s the conditions for the Jewish minority in Sweden changed for the better. By the end of the 1800s, Jews could live more freely and immigrants did not need a visa to enter. This led to a new wave of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe.

One of those was Salomon Rosenbaum.

Salomon Rosenbaum was born in Garvas, Poland in 1848. He came to Sweden in 1869.

After a year in Stockholm, he moved to Sundsvall to work as a traveling salesman for a Jewish-owned clothing store, Nasielsky’s, where he worked for several years.

Rosenbaum was married to Carolina, neé Adelsohn, who was born in Suwalki - a city in northeastern Poland - in 1863. They had four children, three sons and a daughter.

In 1897, he received trading privileges that enabled him to open his own haberdashery, Rosenbaum’s, in Sundsvall which for decades supplied the city with fashionable quality clothes.

Rosenbaum applied for citizenship several times, but his application was declined every time. The authorities used different arguments to deny his citizenship.

On one occasion, they wrote that he didn’t have enough money. Another time the authorities said that even though Rosenbaum had an impeccable record, his application was declined because 'the Polish Jews as a group' caused trouble and were of no value for the country.

This shows clearly how views of this immigrant group were at the time and how they faced discrimination from the authorities.

After Rosenbaum’s death in 1910, his family continued to run the store until the 1970s. His relatives still live in Sweden today.

Audre Lorde

James Baldwin

Astrid Roemer

The relationships between Europe and the Americas have long and complex histories - fraught by power structures and colonialism while offering cultural exchange and educational and professional opportunities. Authors have negotiated these relationships in their writing for centuries.

This blog will feature Audre Lorde, James Baldwin and Astrid Roemer: three Black authors from the Americas who have lived and worked in Europe and whose writing occupies an important place in LGBTQ+ heritage.

Audre Lorde was born in New York City in 1934, the daughter of migrants from the Caribbean. She decribed herself as a 'Black, lesbian, mother, warrior, poet'. Her writing explores issues of feminism, lesbianism, civil rights and the Black female identity.

From the 1950s onwards through the 1960s, Lorde's education and career brought her to live in locations across the Americas - from New York city to Mississippi and Mexico. From 1972 to 1987, Lorde lived on Staten Island. During that time, in addition to writing and teaching, she co-founded Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press.

Her first book of poems,The First Cities, was published in 1968. She authored more than a dozen further books through the 1970s and into the 1980s, includingThe Black Unicorn: Poemsin 1978,The Cancer Journalsin 1980 andSister Outsiderin 1984.

Through her writing, Lorde explored identity and difference in communities and individual. She wrote, 'I am defined as other in every group I'm part of'.

In 1984, Lorde began a visiting professorship at the Free University of Berlin in then West Berlin, West Germany. There, she was influential in a growing social movement for Black people living in Germany. These communities faced widespread discrimination and stereotyping, with a long history of systemic racism in Germany.

She named this movement 'Afro-German', together with a group of Black women activists in Berlin, and became a mentor to a number of women who were Afro-German authors and activists.

She spent weeks and months each year in Berlin, often accompanied by her colleague and partner Dr. Gloria I. Joseph. She described her time there as one of the most significant in her life.

Audre Lorde's time in Berlin is documented in a film,The Berlin Years: 1984–1992, with a websiteAudre Lorde in Berlinoffering an online tour to places where Audre Lorde spent time in Berlin with photos, videos and sound clips conn. An archive - theAudre Lorde Archiveis also kept at the Freie Universität Berlin.

African-American author James Baldwin was born in New York City in 1924, growing up in Harlem. Over his long writing career, his prose and poetry explores interconnected themes of identity, masculinity, sexuality and race.

Baldwin was educated in several schools in New York and spent some time living in Greenwich Village. He began to develop his writing career, publishing articles and short stories.

Baldwin became disillusioned with life as a Black man in the United States, faced with prejudice and discrimination. Aged 24, he decided to emigrate from the USA and moved to Paris in 1948.

There, he became involved with literary circles and counter-culture movements, publishing articles in anthologies.

In 1953, Baldwin's first novel was published. Go Tell It on the Mountain tells the story of John Grimes, a Black teenager living in Harlem in the 1930s and his relationship with his family, community and church - exploring themes of religion, class, race and poverty. Notes of a Native Son, a collection of essays, was published in 1955.

His 1956 novel Giovanni’s Room detailed an affair between a bisexual American expat in Paris and an Italian man facing execution. It brought Baldwin into the literary spotlight, as well as  caused controversy due to its explicit homoerotic content.

Baldwin continued to live in France for most of his life, as well as spending some time in Switzerland and Turkey. From 1970 onwards, Baldwin moved to Saint-Paul-de-Vence in the south of France. There, he continued to write and published further novels, short stories and collections.

During his life, Baldwin was neither in the closet nor open to the public about his sexual orientation and relationships with men. His writing dealt with black and white characters, as well as heterosexual, gay, and bisexual characters. Through his writing, Baldwin articulating anger and frustration at parallel prejudices of homophobia and racism.

James Baldwin died in December 1987 and today is remembered as an inspirational figure in the Civil Rights and gay liberation movements.

Surinamese author Astrid Roemer has lived in Europe for decades - mostly in the Netherlands, where she has built an award-winning career writing novels, drama and poetry in Dutch. Her writing has explored themes of migration, feminism and identity.

Born in 1947 in Paramaribo, Roemer trained as a teacher. She first travelled to the Netherlands in 1966 while working as a teacher in Suriname.

In 1970, she published her first book of poetry,Sasa mijn actuele zijn. It was published under the pseudonym Zamani, a Swahili name which emphasized her African roots.

She published her first novel,Neem mij terug Suriname(Take me back Suriname) in 1974. The novel, which was very successful in Suriname, explores the theme of Surinamese emigration to the Netherlands, nostalgia and longing to return.

In 1975, Roemer lived this theme by moving to the Netherlands. Until 1975, Suriname had been a part of the Netherlands - firstly as a colony until 1954 and subsequently as a country within the Netherlands. She decided to move to the Netherlands having been fired from her teaching role for refusing to take part in Sinterklaas celebrations which include theblackface Zwarte Pietcharacter.

Her later novels explore feminist topics. Her 1982 novel Over de gekte van een vrouw ('On the madness of a woman') investigated female identity and the oppression of women. Its success in the Netherlands established her as a feminist writer and made her a lesbian role model.

She wrote novels, plays and poetry which were published widely through the 1980s. By 1989, Roemer was living in The Hague, working for a time as a city councillor for the Groen Links left-wing political party.

Between 2000 and 2015, Roemer lived in a variety of locations - in the Netherlands, in Rome, back to Suriname and in Scotland and Belgium. In December 2015, she was awarded the 2016 PC Hooft Prize - an most important literary prize in the Netherlands and Belgium.

Partners & pioneers of Irish theatre

Micheal Mac Liammóir was an actor and director who, along with his partner Hilton Edwards, was a pioneer of Irish theatre and a leading cultural figure in 20th century Ireland.

Born Alfred Willmore in London in 1899 into a family with no connections to Ireland, he became a child actor. He acted in plays during his teenage years, and chose to study painting at the Slade School of Art in London. He gave up these studies however, to avoid conscription and travel abroad.

In the 1920s, he travelled across Europe. He was captivated by Irish culture, learning Irish, until he was fluent speaking and writing.

In 1924, he joined a theatrical tour of Ireland with his brother-in-law Anew McMaster's company. Adopting the name Michaél Mac Liammóir, he presented himself as a descendant of Irish Roman Catholics from Cork.

In 1927, in Enniscorthy, County Wexford, he was to meet Hilton Edwards, a British actor and theatre producer who would become his personal and professional partner.

Watch this archive film of both men in 1968 remembering the time they met

Both men wanted to found their own theatre. They had complementary talents: Mac Liammóir was an actor, designer and writer; Edwards was a director, actor, producer and lighting designer.

In 1928, they founded theGate Theatrein Dublin.

In the first season, they presented seven plays, including Henrik Ibsen's Peer Gynt, Eugene O’Neill's The Hairy Ape and Oscar Wilde's Salomé. The Gate Theatre became known for introducing Dublin audiences to new European and American plays, as well as classic and modern Irish theatre.

Alongside developing the Gate Theatre, through the 1930s, Mac Liammóir and Edwards established themselves as major figures in the Irish cultural scene.

By the 1950s, their careers had moved into film and cinema, alongside theatre.

In 1953, Mac Liommóir played Iago in Orson Welles' film version ofOthellowith Hilton Edwards playing Brabantio. In 1964, Mac Liammóir wrote and performed a one man showThe Importance of Being Oscar- based on the life and work of Oscar Wilde - for the new Irish television station Telefís Éireann which had been founded at the end of 1961.

Hilton Edwards was to take a significant role in Telefís Éireann - in 1961, he became the television station's first Head of Drama.

These are mere highlights in their long careers - Hilton Edwards directed more than 300 plays for the Gate Theatre, while Michaél Mac Liammóir published many books, painted and acted in many plays and films.

Mac Liammóir and Edwards were a couple at a time when homosexuality was illegal in Ireland. Irish society for the majority of the 20th century was conservative and Catholic. It was not until 1993 that homosexuality was decriminalised. Mac Liammóir and Edwards did not 'come out' in the way we may understand today, nor did they refer to themselves as a couple. Irish society simply did not have an understanding or the words for such things.

Recognising his status as a leading cultural impressario, in 1969 on his 70th birthday, Ireland's leading television show, the Late Late Show, broadcast an episode in tribute to Michaél Mac Liammóir. In this, Michaél speaks about Hilton Edwards as his partner and refers their 'life at home'.

See a clip from the Late Late Show tribute here

Michaél Mac Liammóir died in 1978, aged 78. Hilton Edwards died in 1982, aged 79. Both men are buried alongside each other in Saint Fintan's Cemetery, Sutton, Dublin.

A bright-coloured mohawk, green forehead, orange sideburns, purple collar and perching toes: not your idea of a dream date? The mandarin duck could make you reconsider!

Apart from being considered among the most beautiful bird species in the world, this native of China - sometimes called ‘The Far East Rainbow’ or ‘the Yin-Yang duck’ - is also believed to be the most faithful.

For centuries, mandarin duck pairs were thought to stay together for life. Yet in reality theAix galericulatais more capricious than that, pairing for the season yet moving on to a new partner in autumn.

Still, in Asian culture, the mandarin ducks remain the prime symbol of love, fidelity and fertility.

When it comes to making a dashing impression, the drake mandarin outshines his female companion.

He’s the one making all the noise - females don’t tend to quack - and carrying thick white eyeliner as well as a train of elongated orange feathers. His partner is happy to compensate with a more discrete pallet, boasting spotted wings in greys and browns. In summer, however, the drake moults and sheds his colourful attire, leaving only his bright beak as an identifier.

With its flamboyant looks, the mandarin duck has been a favourite of artists for centuries. Unfortunately, it has also attracted the attention of bird collectors, who - often illegally - obtained and kept them far away from their natural habitat.

As early as the 18th century, mandarin ducks were imported into the United Kingdom because of their exotic appeal. From the 1930s onwards, escaped animals started breeding in Europe.

Curious about mandarin ducks near you? TheBirdLife International webpageallows you to trace the worldwide population.

The most important symbol of love, devotion and romance in Asian culture, the mandarin duck is the pendant of lovebirds, doves and swans in the West.

Wedding ceremonies, family traditions and house decoration would not be complete without references to the striking pair.

The origins of this symbolism are rooted in several legends, one of which tells of a man who considered divorcing his wife. Just before telling her, he went for a walk and saw a couple of mandarin ducks reminding him of happier times. This made him reconsider his divorce and the ducks were henceforth regarded as love charms.

A more tragic story recounts the ill fate of gardener Yuan who saved Ying, the daughter of his wealthy employer, from a pond. His employers, however, regarded this not as a heroic act but as an intrusion, and Yuan was imprisoned. After a visit by Ying, who brought him a colourful robe, her father had Yuan thrown into the pond. Ying chose to join him. Later, a pair of mandarin ducks was seen by the water, the male bright and colourfulcolorful like the robe given by Ying. They were thought to be a metamorphosis of the unlucky couple that nevertheless would spend their lives together.

Yuan and Ying continue to be remembered in the term used for mandarin ducks (Yuan Yang or 鸳鸯), which is also a colloquial expression for an ‘odd couple’ or ‘unlikely pair’.

Representations of mandarin ducks permeate a wide range of Asian art forms, but are also featured on objects for everyday use, including bed sheets, pillowcases, cups and saucers, and furniture. They remain popular gifts in China at the occasion of weddings, for instance as figurines made in porcelain, jade or wood.

Often, a lotus is featured as well, either as a basis for sitting ducks or as an ornament on its bill or back. The flower adds to the ducks’ symbolic power, as it is considered auspicious and stands for purity and harmony. Lotus seeds, moreover, represent wishes for a couple to have a numerous family.

The couple receiving a duck-themed present is believed to be blessed with a life full of love, marital bliss and plentiful offspring. Mandarin ducks are also given to singles to aid in their search for love, or used by married couples to reinvigorate their relationship.

Despite their talisman qualities, mandarin ducks should be handled with care: according to feng shui principles, strict conditions are to be observed when it comes to positioning duck-related items in your house.

Looking for love? Then place the ducks next to your bed. To give your marriage a boost, put them on the husband’s night table. What not to do: get one instead of a pair, confine duck depictions to an ill-lit area, or display them inside of a wooden frame.

For all its amorous symbolism, not every duck is made to fit the mould.

That certainly goes for the drake (nicknamed ‘Mandarin Patinkin’ or ‘the Hot Duck’), observed in New York Central Park for about four months in late 2018 and early 2019. After having been featured in The New York Times, the People's Daily, and in reports on BBC and CNN, he suddenly disappeared.

His heartbroken fans ('the quackarazzi') wildly speculated as to the possibly tragic fate of their beloved bird. Yet the answer might be as simple as 'fatigue', suggests his most fervent Twitter-supporter: 'My best guess was that he flew far enough north to a small pond remote from people.'

Sometimes it takes a strange bird to show that going solo is perfectly fine.

Singer-songwriter and advocate for the rights of Black people across the world

South African musician Miriam Makeba was born in a township near Johannesburg in 1932, becoming known through the 1960s as a world famous singer-songwriter and advocate for the rights of Black people across the world.

Throughout the 1960s, Makeba and her music reinforced her involvement with various black political movements like Black Power, anti-apartheid, the civil rights and Black Consciousness.

After early musical success in South Africa, 1959 saw the beginning of Makeba’s international career.

Her small guest appearance in the anti-apartheid film Come back, Africa and her role as the female lead in Todd Matshikiza’s musical King Kong, both in 1959, kickstarted her career abroad.

She performed in London, where she met the Jamaican-American singer Harry Belafonte, who became her mentor, helping her with her first solo recordings. In November 1959, she made her debut on television in the USA, and moved to New York.

In 1952, the white-minority South African government introduced pass laws, an internal segregative passport system. During protests against these laws in 1960, 69 people were killed and 180 injured in what is known as the Sharpeville massacre. Those killed included two members of Makeba's family.

Shortly after the Sharpeville massacre, she learned that her mother had died - as her passport had been cancelled, she was not allowed to return to South Africa for her mother's funeral. Feeling that she had a responsibility as someone who had been able to leave the country while others couldn't, she became increasingly outspoken about apartheid and the white-minority government.

Her music appealled to people of different backgrounds especially Black Americans who related her struggles against apartheid to their own struggle against racial segregation which she also faced while living in the US.

'There wasn't much difference in America; it was a country that had abolished slavery but there was apartheid in its own way.'

In 1962, she testified against the apartheid system before the United Nations Special Committee against Apartheid. This led to her South African citizenship and her right to return being revoked as well as her music being banned.

As a result of this, she was given passports by Algeria, Ghana, Belgium and Guinea, and would later hold nine passports in her life as well as citizenship to ten countries. She would later testify again in 1964 calling for actions against the South African government.

She married the Trinidadian-American civil rights activist and prominent Black Panther figure Stokely Carmichael in 1968. This resulted in her being labeled an extremist by Conservatives while the CIA kept a close eye on her movements as well as setting up recording devices in her apartment.

Due to her marriage to Carmchichael, her popularity in the US declined specifically with her White audience. When she was banned from returning to the country after a trip to the Bahamas, she moved to Guinea along with her husband and did not return to the US until 1987.

Makeba and her husband developed a close frienship with Guinea's president Ahmed Sékou Touré and his wife Andrée. Carmichael changed his name to Kwame Ture in honour of the exiled president of Ghana Kwame Nkrumah and Touré who had both become his mentors.

As more African countries gained their independence from European colonial powers she was invited to perform at independence ceremonies. She toured Europe and Asia as well but her performances in Africa were extremely popular, she became the highlight of festivals with ‘Pata Pata’ bringing the Liberian crowd to hysterics to the point that she could not finish the song.
Makeba later recalled that it was during this period she accepted being referred to as 'Mama Africa'.

By 1978 Makeba and Ture divorced, and after her daughter Bongi's death during childbirth in 1985, she decided to move to Belgium with her grandchildren. 
Three years later, she took part in the Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute concert in London which was used to raise awareness of apartheid. A survery after the concert found that support for Mandela's release from prison grew.

In 1990, with increasing international and domestic pressure from the Anti-appartheid movement, South African State President Frederik Willem de Klerk reversed the ban on anti-appartheid organisations and released Mandela from prison.

Makeba was an anti-colonialist that called for 'Africans who live everywhere should fight everywhere. The struggle is no different in South Africa, the streets of Chicago, Trinidad or Canada. The Black people are the victims of capitalism, racism and oppression, period'.

With the end of the South African apartheid system in the 1990s, Mandela persuaded Makeba to return. She live there until her death while on tour in Italy in 2008 aged 78. Makeba is credited for bringing African music to a global audience and for being a pioneer of the emerging genre of world music.

African-American fashion designer Kelly broke barriers in the stiff European fashion industry

'Patrick landed like a bomb in my shop in 1985. He was so gay and so full of energy, and so were his clothes'.

This is how the buyer at Victoria boutiques in Paris described Patrick Kelly and the fashion he dreamed and made – as if the man and his practice were one the natural extension of the other.

Patrick Kelly is probably one of the most renowned and cherished African-American fashion designers, who managed to set records and, most importantly, break barriers in the stiff European fashion industry.

Born in Mississippi in 1954, he learned to sew at a very young age, probably helped by his mother, who was a home economics teacher. Right after graduating, he moved to Atlanta, where he worked in a thrift shop and was exposed to a great deal of vintage designer clothes, which he sometimes modified turning them into new, original designs.

Model Pat Cleveland, a big fan of his creations, pushed him to move to New York to establish his label. But the true turning point for his career was moving to Paris in 1980, where he could fully pursue his passion and express his utter talent as a fashion designer.

It is indeed in Paris that Kelly became the designer of records. He established his company Patrick Kelly Paris with friend photographer Bjorn Amelan in 1985.

In 1988, he was the first American designer to be admitted to the prestigious Chambre syndicale du prêt-à-porter des couturiers et des créateurs de mode: something that consecrated him to the status of ‘createur’.

His style was playful and daringly excessive, and he was known for cuts as well as for loud accessories, Eiffel pins and crazy buttons.

He was extremely proud of his roots and culture, and actively included his own background into his practice, merging the celebration of Black identity with an extraordinarily contemporary aesthetic and witty nods at Parisian fashion tradition.

Kelly’s designers were highly influenced by his art history and African American history studies, which showed an interest that he then pursued becoming a collector of Black memorabilia - he had a collection of over 6,000 Black dolls from various periods - and an avid admirer of pop art.

He often directly referenced African American culture, and some items even caused controversy, as lapel pins featuring black babydoll faces, which were inspired by his doll collection and, according to Kelly, belonged to Black history.

His creations were loved by celebrities and his style was mostly popular in Europe. Not only did he have his label, but also designed for companies such as Benetton, managing to design amazing and meaningful clothes that people could actually afford - and he loved this.

In 1986, he told a journalist of the Times: ‘I'm the hero of people who just don't want to spend a lot of money on clothes.’

His penchant for flamboyance and subversion emerged also in the way he orchestrated the presentations of his collections, which had to be the very first celebration of his creative thought. His fashion shows were joyful and diverse, under every aspect.

He included models of different sizes and body types on his runways. When asked about this daring action, he declared: ‘*I design for fat women, skinny women, all kinds of women. My message is, you’re beautiful just the way you are.*’ The subversion to the canon represented by French fashion did not stop - in 1987, he sent a model who was eight months pregnant onto the catwalk.

Unfortunately, Patrick Kelly died in 1990 from AIDS, at the height of success, leaving a huge gap in the industry.

The words pronounced by his friend and feminist activist Gloria Steinem at his memorial summed up his creative mind as well as his social commitment. She stated: ‘*Instead of dividing us with gold and jewels, he unified us with buttons and bows.*’

Run-up to the Olympics

Facing both Jim Crow and Hitler in a sporting environment

Reaching international heights, track and field athlete Jesse Owens  would set the world record for long jump that would stand for 25 years. His four gold medals win at the Olympic Games in Berlin, during the Nazi regime, would bring him many adoring German fans. His  victory - along with those of other African American athletes -  questioned the Nazi  propaganda on Aryan superiority.

Born on September 12 1913 in Oakville, Alabama as James Cleveland Owens, his family moved to Cleveland, Ohio when he was nine, when more than a million African Americans left the segregated South for better opportunities as part of what is known as the Great Migration.

He had been known as J.C up until his teacher when asking him his name, thought he said Jesse instead of J.C due to his southern accent, which would stick with him for the rest of his life.

Owens realised he had a passion for running. He first came to national attention while he was attending East Technical High School in Cleveland, taking part in the National High School Championship of 1933 in Chicago. He matched the world record of the 100 yard dash (91m) in 9.4 seconds and long-jumped 24 feet 9 ½ inches (7.56 meters).

While attending Ohio State University, under the coaching of Larry Snyder, he won eight National Collegiate Athletic Association championships.

Though successful, he had to live off campus, eat at Blacks-only restaurants and could only stay at Blacks-only hotels when travelling with his team. He continued to work part-time to pay for school, as he could not receive any scholarships for track and field because the sport was not well respected despite his achievements.

Owens set three world records in 1935: for the long jump, 220 yard (201.2m) sprint, and 220 yard low hurdles, and tied in the 100 yard dash.

In 1931, the International Committee awarded the 1936 Summer Olympics to Berlin. By 1933, Hitler had come to power instituting anti-Semitic policies and remilitarising the government. Sport, and the upcoming Olympics, were used by the Nazi government as part of the drive to strengthen the 'Aryan race'.

In 1935, athletic groups in the USA pushed for a boycott of the Berlin games. Prominent Jewish-American athletes and Jewish athletes from other countries wanted to boycott the Olympics in protest at the  Nazi's oppression of Jews.

Owens was persuaded by the NAACP to vocalise that America should withdraw from the 1936 Olympics due to discrimination against minorities, but it is said that he and others eventually took part due to the president of the American Olympics committee branding those opposing 'un-American agitators'. Some sources also claim that they wanted to prove that black athletes were not inferior and felt it hypocritical to boycott considering America's own discriminative policies.

Once in Germany, Adi Dassler, the founder of Adidas, persuaded Owens to wear his shoes making the first sponsorship deal for an African-American male athlete.

In Berlin, Germany had the largest national team and captured most of the medals. The Americans, however, were in command of the track and field events.

Jesse Owens became the star of the Games with four gold medals.

He matched the world record for the 100 metre race (10.3 seconds), and broke the world records for the 200 metre race at 20.7 seconds and broad jump (26 feet 5 3/8 inches). He was applauded by the mostly German crowd and developed a friendship with Luz Long, the German long jumper and silver medalist.

Along with Owens, 17 other African-Americans were part of the American team. Hitler had been congratulating winners on the first day of the Olympics, though left shortly after African-Americans David Albritton and Cornelius Johnson won the high-jump event. Due to this incident, the organisers asked Hitler to congratulate all winners or none at all. He chose none, but secretly congratulated German winners in private.

While African-American athletes won 14 medals in total (8 gold, 4 silver and 2 bronze), none received as much recognition as Jesse Owens.

It was easier to tell the story of one African-American because that's an anomaly. But 18, that's a lot for Jim Crow newspapers to want to report on.

Deborah Riley Draper

Owens, along with the other African-American athletes, defied the propaganda the Nazi regime wanted to sell during the Olympics about Aryan superiority, and so were branded as primitives with stronger physique 'than those of civilised white and hence should be excluded from future games’, Nazi minister Albert Speer wrote on Hilter’s thoughts.

Ironically, Jesse Owens and his African-American teammates were allowed to travel with and stay in the same hotel as whites in Germany - back in the United States, they did not have such privileges.

After the games had ended, the Olympic team was invited to compete in Sweden, but Owens decided he wanted to pursue financial gain by returning to the US to take up  endorsement offers. He had continued to face discrimination throughout his athletic career, having to work to pay his way with no access scholarships. So when faced with endorsement opportunities, naturally he took it. This angered the US athletic officials who withdrew his amateur status, ending his career instantly.

Owens had returned to the US an international star yet had difficulty in finding work. He was banned from appearing at amateur sporting events to uphold his image and commercial offers disappeared. A few of his African-American teammates entered academia or held elected office, but many struggled to secure stable careers upon returning. Mack Robinson the silver medalist once used his Olympic jacket while working as a street sweeper to keep warm.

By the 1950s, Owens started working in public relations and would travel the country and abroad making guest appearances at public events.

When he died in 1980 of lung cancer at the age of 66, the US president Jimmy Carter paid him tribute saying, 'Perhaps no athlete better symbolised the human struggle against tyranny, poverty and racial bigotry'.

Jesse Owens, along with the 17 African-American athletes, two of which were women,  faced both Jim Crow and Hitler in sporting environments. They defied stereotypes, inspiring future Black Olympians. Their victories - along with the boycott debate - brought attention towards racial discrimination in sports.

How the Kindertransport rescued thousands of mostly Jewish children in the months before World War II

Each year on 27 January, theUnited Nationscommemorates the victims ofNazi Germany’s genocidal policies, and in particular theHolocaust. This day is also meant to honour survivors of the Holocaust and recognize the bravery of those who came to their rescue.

One such example of this bravery and ingenuity is theKindertransportwhich refers to the movement to send, primarily Jewish, children to the United Kingdom unaccompanied by their parents as Nazism and its antisemitic policies began to cast their shadows across Europe.

In the period between 1938 and 1940, approximately 10,000 children were sent from Germany, Austria, Poland and Czechoslovakia to foster families in the United Kingdom. Other similar initiatives sent children to Switzerland, Australia, and North America, although on a smaller scale.

The Kindertransport was not a national project, although the British government did approve the visas for theserefugeechildren.

Instead, it was devised by individuals and organisations who took it upon themselves to find homes for children and arrange for their safe passage to Britain. One such example isNicholas Winton, a British stockbroker who organized a series of trains across Europe to take Jewish refugee children from Prague. He washonored for his bravery and generosity in 2014.

Children between the ages of 5 and 17 were transported by train and boat.

Initially, lists of those most imperilled were composed prioritising teenagers who were in concentration camps or in danger of arrest. Other children were selected because their parents were already in concentration camps. In each case, parents and guardians were forced to make the traumatic decision to send their children abroad knowing the likelihood that they would not see them again.

Children often did not know where they were going, did not speak English and were sent off with few possessions which would ultimately become treasured keepsakes of a life which was brutally destroyed.

Upon arrival in England, children were housed in foster homes, schools, hostels, and farms. In the beginning, children were able to maintain correspondence through regular mail delivery and later with the assistance of theRed Cross.

However, as the war progressed and the majority of parents were interned in concentration camps, this became impossible. This was not the only trauma these children experienced. Families were only lightly screened before the arrival of the 'kinder' - as a consequence, many older children were taken in to act as household help or to work on farms.

In 1940, there was an (unfounded) fear that there could be German spies among the refugees. The British government ordered the internment of all refugees between the ages of 16-70, including many kinder. Approximately 400 boys were transported to internment camps in Canada and Australia. The children sent to Australia on theHMT Dunerawere particularly poorly treated sparking a scandal which eventually led to their release.

Although privately organised, the Kindertransport has become an iconic story of British heroism and pragmatism in World War II. It is memorialized today by two statues at London's Liverpool Street Station, where many young refugees arrived over 80 years ago.

The legacy of the Kindertransport is also found in popular culture. The author Michael Bond, creator of the beloved literary characterPaddington Bear, was inspired by memories from his  youth of seeing child refugees of the Kindertransport arriving at train stations.

To hear about the first-hand experiences of the 'kinder', listen to the oral histories available on Europeana from the British Library archival holdings below.

Who was boxer Ben Bril?

What happened to Ben Bril during World War II?

Jewish boxer and referee who survived the Holocaust

In 1928, on his birthday, Ben Bril stepped into a boxing ring. His match was against Myles McDonagh, an Irish flyweight. McDonagh was 23. Bril was turning 16 that day - he was the youngest ever boxer to take part in the Olympic Games.

This was a second round match (Bril had won a bye in his first round fight).

Bril won this match, before being defeated in his next match. Overall, he finish fifth, just outside winning a medal.

Ben Bril was born in 1912 inAmsterdam- host city for the 1928 Olympic Games.

He was the one of seven children to Jewish parents Klaartie Moffie and Abraham Bril, who worked as a fish seller.

One day went with his brother to a boxing club. From that day onwards, Bril started training seriously.

Bril's Olympic matches in 1928 came a year after winning his first Dutch national championship. He would go on to win the Dutch national title eight times. He won a gold medal in 1935 at the second ever Maccabiah Games, a multi-sport tournament for Jewish and Israeli athletes.

Politics, discrimination and Bril's Jewish faith were the reasons for 1928 being Bril's only Olympic matches. He was not chosen for the 1932 squad, and boycotted the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, as they were being held in Nazi Germany.

DuringWorld War II, Nazi Germany occupied the Netherlands. In 1942, Bril was arrested by Jan Olij, the son of Sam Olij, a former 1928 Olympic team mate.

Together with his wife Celia and son Albert, Bril was deported via the Vught and Westerbork transit camps to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. The family survived the horrors - however many of Bril's extended family were murdered.

In the 1960s, Bril found fame as a boxing referee. He travelled across Europe, refereeing fights for the European Boxing Union. He also returned to the Olympic and Maccabiah Games throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s.

Ben Bril died in September 2003, and is remembered today for his boxing career and legacy.

Exploring the history and culture of chess

The Netflix's hit TV seriesThe Queen's Gambithas started a massive surge of interest in chess.

Whether you bought your first set inspired by the story of Beth Harmon or you played chess 'before it was cool', let's explore seven fascinating facts about this game.

The word 'Checkmate' takes its origin from the Persian phrase 'Shah Mat' which means 'the king is dead'.

The title holder of the World chess championship for the longest is Doctor Emanuel Lasker fromGermany.

He held this title for 26 years and 337 days. Emanuel Lasker was a good friend of Albert Einstein.

The first mechanical chess clock was invented by Thomas Wilson in 1883.

Before this discovery, hourglasses with sand were used to track time during the games.

The second-ever book in history to be printed in English was about chess.

William Caxtontranslated it from French into English, and it was printed in 1474.

Blindfold chess is a way of playing chess when the players do not see the pieces and have to memorise their positions.

For centuries, it was considered a skill only prodigies had. Nowadays, the best players can play multiple blindfold games simultaneously.

Chess is one of the few sports and activities where children can compete with adults.

Samuel Reshevsky (1911-1992) was an early child prodigy, who learned to play chess at the age of four. By the age of eight, he was winning against accomplished players in simultaneous games.

TheLewis Chessmenare one of the oldest surviving complete chess sets in the world. They were found on the Isle of Lewis and date to the 12th century.

--------------------------------------------------

Puberty or adolescence, commonly situated between 12 and 20 years of age, is the time in which children start their road to self-sufficiency, gaining independence from the home in which they grew up. The appearance of public education options in the 20th century, providing a more affordable and more accessible alternative to private and church schooling, was a vital factor in this evolution.

While the earliest use of the word ‘teenager’ can be traced to the 1900s, it wasn’t until the 1950s that the term was commonly used. This coincides with the postwar economic boom in Western Europe: parents had fewer kids and more money to spend, as a result of which youth was increasingly targeted as a consumer market.

At the same time, teenagers became the drivers of their own subcultures in music, clothing, film, games, television programmes, books and magazines. While the mid-century bobby socks and poodle skirts mainly exerted influence on how youngsters dressed, later fashion trends came to rule the entire market. T-shirts, mini-skirts and bell-bottom trousers thus became ubiquitous from the 1960s onward.

The thriving economy of the 1980s and 1990s again allowed teens to indulge in their own fashion preferences, this time gravitating to clothing featuring names and logos that more clearly identified them as a separate, interconnected community.

As tomorrow’s adults, teenagers at the end of the century became trendsetters closely watched and serviced by all of society, giving rise to the notion of a ‘teenocracy’ as a replacement for the rule of the elders - the gerontocracy - that was in place previously.

The most surprising factor in the formation of distinct teen culture is the importance of emerging technologies. When cars became more prevalent in the postwar period, teens gained the independence to undertake adventures, establish networks and develop relationships away from home - leaving their parents with fears about the experiments, deviance or trouble they might get into.

From new population class, booming consumer market, and possible security threat, the teenager by the end of the 20th century had become a driver of trends and a benchmark for what’s cool or not.

How lockdowns in the Netherlands affected football

In 2020, in a matter of just a few weeks, national and international football was transformed due to the coronavirus pandemic. While this situation is undeniably exceptional, it is not the first time that a crisis impacts the world of sports to this extent.

Let’s look at some other times when football was locked down, with a particular focus on examples from the Netherlands.

In many countries, football competitions were interrupted because of World War I, such as in Belgium, Germany and the United Kingdom. The outbreak of the Spanish flu also caused a similar phenomenon, in which many national competitions were also cancelled. The football world lost the opportunity to see many great players in action, such as the Scottish Angus Douglas and Dan McMichael, once manager of Hibernian FC.

In the Netherlands, C. Oosterwijk, a board member of Sparta Rotterdam, fell prey to the flu at the young age of thirty. In Winschoten, the famous footballer G. Schoonhoven, and in Deventer, Gerrit van Tongeren died as a result of the disease.

International football came to a grinding halt during World War II. No international matches took place, nor were World Cups or the Olympic Games organised.

Despite this, football was still widely played on a national level in the Netherlands. After just a few weeks of the German invasion of the Netherlands, the Dutch competition was resumed. It is remarkable how this major societal crisis did not impact football to a great extent in this case.

Only in the last year of the war was football finally interrupted in the Netherlands.

3 September 1944 marked the last day of organised football in the country during wartime.Dolle Dinsdag(Mad Tuesday) took place only two days later: a day where the whole country prematurely celebrated the Allied troops’ victory over the Germans. This turned out to be based wholly on a rumour, and ended up paralysing public life altogether.

Because of World War II, FIFA decided to host the 1946 World Cup in Brazil. Choosing a country outside of Europe was a conscious decision, given the continent was still recovering from the ravages of the war. The idea was to have twocatch-upWorld Cups, according to Dutch FIFA member Karel Lotsy. Brazil was to host the 1949 cup, and Switzerland the 1951 cup.

This idea was never carried out in practice: the 1949 cup did not take place as preparations for it were insufficient. It was postponed until 1950. The World Cup of 1951 never took place.

On 30 April 1951, the first case of smallpox - a lethal infectious disease eradicated by the late 1970s - was diagnosed in Tilburg. This resulted in a complete lockdown of the city.

The football team Willem II, based in Tilburg, had just become champions of the Dutch First D Class division, which would have qualified them to play against the other division champions.

The first home match against SC Heerenveen did not take place, given trains were not allowed to stop in Tilburg for a whole month. An away match against the Amsterdam-based Blauw-Wit was likewise postponed.

On 27 May 1951, PSV was the first team to arrive in Tilburg to face Willem II, but only home supporters in possession of a certificate of vaccination were allowed to attend the match. The PSV players played with no fans on the stands and were instructed to go directly from the bus to the pitch.

The club wrote a short article about this epidemic as well, accessibleherein Dutch.

The closure of the Suez Canal, called the Suez Crisis, took place in 1956. Because of the scarcity of petrol, the Netherlands enforced car-free Sundays from 23 November 1956 to 3 February 1957.

The FA was perfectly aware that clubs would financially suffer from the decrease in ticket sales. In some matches, the amount of spectators was immediately reduced to half. Practical jokers in Rotterdam and Limburg traded their cars for horses and travelled to football games on them.

In 1973, an oil crisis occurred when the most important Middle Eastern oil producing countries decided to cut supply to a number of Western countries, as a reaction to their support for the state of Israel. Once again, football suffered due to the resulting oil shortages.

Most night-time matches in England and Germany were cancelled from late November until late January in order to save energy. Matches in the Belgian first division were moved from Sunday 2 November to Saturday 1 November  – a never-before-seen move by the Belgian association. A team as prominent as Arsenal got close to bankruptcy due to these measures.

On the other hand, Italian football was basically not impacted by the crisis. Even more Italian fans attended football games during their first car-free Sunday, under rain, snow or sleet!

Exploring fortresses on the banks of the river Danube in Serbia, each with their own history, myths and legends

Modern means of transport - such as cars, planes and trains - eclipse the significance that riverways once held. The Danube river, due to its position and length, was an especially important pathway for merchants and warriors, while both connecting and separating nations.

The Danube is the second longest river in Europe now connecting ten countries, just as once it connected kingdoms and empires, friends and enemies, kings and warriors. For centuries, the Danube river banks have stood witness to turbulent historical events. Fortresses and citadels built on its riverbanks are still here to tell these stories.

Citadels and fortresses of old served different purposes: defending borders from enemies, controlling riverways and trade, becoming the starting point of conquest or handsomely commanding the view from water.

Embarking along the Danube on a journey through Serbia, a traveller will encounter many fortifications built by the Romans, the Serbs, the Hungarians, the Austrians and the Turks.

The first stop is the Petrovaradin fortress in Novi Sad, nowadays recognizable for theEXITsummer music festival. Built in the late 17th century on the border of two empires, this beautiful and spacious fortress was first controlled by the Austro-Hungarians. Since it was built, it has served as a prison, convent and hospital.

French philosopher René Descartes, leader of Yugoslav Communist party Josip Broz Tito and Nobel prize winner Ivo Andrić were all prisoners in Petrovaradin. A legend claims that during the Napoleonic Wars, treasure from Vienna was hidden in Petrovaradin. However, the biggest mystery of all are its still insufficiently-explored underground halls.

The next stop is theBelgrade fortress– Kalemegdan, located in Serbia’s capital, built by the Romans in the 2nd century at the crossroads that once connected Constantinople and Thessaloniki with the Western Europe.

In the 15th century, the fortress was a medieval city and the capital of Serbian Despotate. It was renovated first by the Austrians and then by the Turks, in the 18th century. Today, Kalemegdan functions as a museum and park, and the cultural and historical point of Belgrade offering an astounding view of the confluence of the rivers Sava and Danube.

Further down the Danube sits the Smederevo fortress.

Built in the 15th century as a fortified city and the palace of the Serbian despot Djuradj Brankovic, it was the capital of Serbian Despotate as well as its political and cultural centre.

Many legends surround its hasty construction that had taken only two years to complete. The most well-known claims that it was built at great cost and with much sacrifice only to satisfy the caprice of the despot’s young wife, the Byzantine princess Irina, henceforth remembered as the Damned Jerina.

Only 40 kilometres down the river rests another 15th century fortress, the Ram fortress, but this edifice was built by the Turks.

Its strategic positioning enabled them to control the traffic on the river Danube, as well as for defence purposes. Ram was built as an artillery fort with thick and not extremely high walls.

Today, the fortress offers a beautiful view of the Danube which, quite surprisingly, intersects with another four rivers in this area, the rivers Karaš, Nera, Morava and Mlava.

Djerdap Gorge is one of the longest composite gorges in Europe, and theGolubac fortressguards its entrance since the Middle Ages.

Although no accurate data is available, it is assumed that it was built by the Serbs in the 13th century, and at one time was also controlled by the Turks. Unlike Ram fortress, Golubac is a medieval fortress with remarkably high walls.

Its name derives from the Serbian word for pigeon. According to a legend, when looking from the river, its towers and walls looked like pigeons. Another legend claims the fort was named after a Serbian girl named Golubana. An Ottoman commander was in love with her, but she rejected him. To punish her, the commander left Golubana to die on a rock in the middle of the river. Known as “Babakaj”, this rock was chained to the fortress allowing the passage only to those willing to pay the fee.

At the end of this virtual journey, near the town of Kladovo, sits the Fetislam fortress.

Initially called Kladowa, it was built on the foundations of a Roman fortress and served as a starting point for Ottoman conquests, hence the name – in TurkishFethul Islamstand for “The gate of Islam”.

There are twelve fortresses overall on the banks of the river Danube in Serbia, each with its own history to tell, and each shrouded in myths and legends making not only tourist attractions but cultural points as well.

These iconic ships have long been one of the defining symbols of Chinese naval warfare, travel and trade

In some of these vessels there will be employed a thousand men, six hundred sailors and four hundred soldiers.

The magnificent junks described in the travel report ofIbn Battuta(1304–1377) evoke a grandeur befitting the most iconic among Chinese naval inventions. As Battuta’s account suggests, junks were used as warfare ships. But they served other purposes as well, including trading, fishing, housing, recreation and… exploring the world. Chinese junks have been known to set out for Indonesian and Indian territories as early as the Middle Ages.

The dimensions and first-rate equipment of the junks is what seems to have impressed Battuta the most, as he goes on to state that “every vessel… is like an independent city”. Centuries later, the junks still astonished travellers from the West, as is shown in the writings ofJohn Barrow(1764-1848). The linguist-geographer included in his Travels in China (1804) a description of a “clumsy looking junk” that astonished the crew of a British ship by sailing ever so fast and smoothly.

Although the junk comes in a wide range of sizes and with historically and geographically varying specifications, it is indeed true that its basic construction allows for it to be scaled up to a massive size. Among the junk’s most important characteristics is the massive rudder functioning as a centreboard.

The hull of the junk is partitioned into vertical and horizontal compartments. This counts as an important innovation in naval design that significantly added to the ship’s strength.

The ultimate eye-catchers of any junk are its sails, attached to up to five masts. Shaped like a square, the sails are usually made of linen or matting, articulated by strips of bamboo.

A roll-up system allows for the sails to be closed or spread in the blink of an eye, lending the junk a versatility and agility that vessels of this size often lack. As a whole, the design features of the junk amount to a ship that is easy to navigate and resilient enough to conquer the roughest of seas.

The mighty potential of the junk was definitely demonstrated by the Keying: one of the most famous ships of its type. Around 1850, it was the first junk to reach the Cape of Good Hope, continuing towards the United States and Britain.

Captains Charles Alfred Kellett and So Yin Sang Hsi managed to steer the three-master, weighing over 800 tons, through a hurricane. Yet they weren’t prepared for the storm of visitors that wanted to explore the majestic ship upon its arrival in New York. For the Americans, this was a unique opportunity to immerse themselves in Chinese culture. As a result, over 7.000 people a day were reported visiting the Keying’s lavish Grand Saloon in Chinese style and its many art treasures.

After having left America over half a year later, the Keying weathered a storm that disabled the rudder, tore one of the sails, and left a crew member killed. Yet at its next destination, it again drew in the crowds. “One step across the entrance and you are in the Chinese world; you have quitted the Thames for the vicinity of Canton”, The Times jubilated. In the Illustrated London News (1848), the craftsmanship of the Chinese shipbuilders and the heroic adventures of the Keying were applauded in no uncertain terms: “She proved herself an excellent sea-boat; and her powers of weathering a storm equal, if not surpass, those of vessels of British build.”

More honour was bestowed upon the Keying by means of a commemorative medal that was issued upon its arrival in London harbour.

Despite its glorious reception, the Keying suffered an innocuous ending: in 1853 the ship was sold and towed out of London harbour only to be abandoned a few years later. Its memory, however, is still cherished in China, wherea model of the Keyingon a 1:12 scale is on show at the Hong Kong Maritime Museum.

Some naval enthusiasts consider the Hong Kong Keying’s proportions, dimensions and shape to be faulty and unhistorical. Yet it is thought by specialists to be a more accurate rendition of the original than the overly curved, titanesque contemporary depictions. Seen in this light, the paintings and drawings of the illustrious junk go to show that Chinese culture reflected through Western eyes, is a complex (hi)story in and of itself.

From humble fisher boat to illustrious vessel: a plenitude of Chinese junks is on display in our hand-picked gallery. Welcome aboard!

How women were represented in early 20th-century media

Photographs, film footage, ads and posters are incredibly valuable witnesses to how gender roles and stereotypes changed throughout the 20th century, not only in what they portray but also in what they suggest, promote and assume.

In the early 20th century, women were often depicted in relation to their male relatives (husband, father, siblings) and children, or in relation to their roles and responsibilities at home.

Whenever portrayed on their own, women were mostly featured in dreamy compositions representing ideals of femininity, featuring elegant poses and accessories such as luxurious fabrics, lavish bouquets of flowers, gloves, lace handkerchiefs and parasols.

As the first decades of the 20th century saw women gaining more independence both in terms of suffrage and of (war) employment, a parallel realm of imagery emerged. Yet while stressing the importance of women’s role in society, the rhetorics were often pointing to the presumed temporary nature of this new gender equilibrium. After World War II indeed representations of women followed the societal and governmental impetus to return to the pre-war status quo. This dichotomy is emphasized by the imagery of the 1950s.

In this brief intermission - an advertisement for detergent - men are assumed to be watching the program, yet only women are addressed as being responsible for doing the laundry. The presenter is perfectly groomed and glamorously dressed, adding to the imagery of the perfect homemaker one could aspire to.

The family was considered a safe, stable refuge in a world of chaos, by citizens and governments alike. That bubble came to represent peace and prosperity, and the ensuing ‘baby boom’ as a band-aid capable of healing the wounds of war.

Only as the second wave of feminism came about in the 1960s and 70s, the portraiture of women and the contexts in which they were shown in advertising and media started to systematically depart from deeply rooted stereotypes.

In parallel, the imagery of women started to diversify: previously only featured in their relation to men alternatives to the housewife ideal gained momentum in the public visual discourse and different representations emerged of what it meant to be a woman.

While not dissolved by the end of the century, the dichotomy of the image and expectations of women as being centred on family and morality, and that of men as being tuned to economy, politics and societal success became blurred at the edges. Notions of femininity, beauty standards and other gender-related conventions were also actively challenged by female photographers, filmmakers and artists who started to permeate visual culture from the 1960s onwards.

European Capital of Sport 2021: Lisbon

European Green Capital 2021: Lahti

European Capital of Innovation 2020: Leuven

European Youth Capital 2021: Klaipėda

European Capital of Culture?

European Capitals for Sport, Innovation, Green, Youth and Culture

Knowing all the capital cities of European countries is a fun game for geography fans. But away from the geographical capital cities, there are many other capital cities across Europe each year.

In 2021, there will be a European Capital of Sport, a European Green Capital, a European Capital of Innovation as well as a European Youth Capital.

Each of these programmes highlight a city in Europe, focusing on their sporting, environmental, innovation and youth activities and culture.

Let's take a look at where will be highlighted in 2021.

The European Capital of Sport is awarded each year to a city with more than 500,000 people. In 2021, Lisbon in Portugal is the European Capital of Sport.

This title is awarded - along with awards for European City, Community, Town and Region of Sport - to recognise communities' commitment to and advances in sport and wellbeing facilities.

TheEuropean Green Capital Awardpromotes and reward urban communities commitment and innovation to resolve'environmental challenges.

Lahti, in Finland, is the European Green Capital for 2021, ahead of two finalists both in France: Lille and Strasbourg.

This prize recognises and advances innovation in European cities. However, it is not awarded until later in the year. The reigningEuropean Capital of Innovationwas award in September 2020 to Leuven in Belgium.

The European Youth Capital is awarded to empower young people, boost youth participation and strengthen European identity through social, cultural and political projects.

Klaipėda - the third city of Lithuania, on the Baltic Sea coast - is the European Youth Capital for 2021.

Each year, the European Capital of Culture celebrates a city’s heritage and its contribution to European culture. It is marked with exhibitions, artistic programmes, theatre shows, dance, opera, music and other projects specific to individual cities.

Initially three cities were chosen as European Capital of Culture for 2021: Eleusis in Greece, Novi Sad in Serbia and Timisoara in Romania.

However, due to the Coronavirus pandemic, the 2020 Capitals of Culture - Galway in Ireland and Rijeka in Croatia - have been given an extension into 2021 with the other cities' years postponed to 2022 and 2023.

What does ‘flapper’ mean? Even though the true origins of the world are controversial, in the 1920s ‘flapper’ became associated with young women who expressed their freedom through an overt appreciation of a new kind of fashionable look.

On 30 November 1927, a journalist of the British magazine Punch, wrote:

"Flapper is the popular press catch-word for an adult woman worker, aged twenty-one to thirty, when it is a question of giving her the vote under the same conditions as men of the same age.”

Flappers embodied the joyful and proactive spirit of the 1920s, indeed a decade of revolution in many respects: right after the end of WW1, the social scene was prone to change, and women fought not to lose the active role they gained in society during the difficult years of the war.

The so-called ‘roaring twenties’ were a time of technological, cultural and social progress, of new incomes and surprising wealth; all these factors led women to hard-earned victories, such as the right to vote, to attend university, to work and sustain themselves if they wanted to: a new world full of opportunities.

Lifestyle became the keyword defining the renewed interest in participating in the hectic social life of the city. Music played a central role as the emergence of jazz and charleston, and the opening of clubs for drinking and dancing spurred on the design of increasingly flamboyant clothes and accessories.

The large, often young flapper fashion clientele was all too willing to invest in glamorous outfits, leveraging on the economic prosperity of the post-war period.

One of the authors most associated with describing this biotope is Francis Scott Fitzgerald: the creator of timeless novels such as This Side of Paradise and The Great Gatsby, and of the volume of short stories Flappers and Philosophers, all of which feature female characters epitomizing the essence and look of flappers.

The flapper dresses’ fundamental characteristics pointed to a dynamic lifestyle: they were straight, sleeveless and loose, and usually made in airy and light fabrics. They did not have a corset but relied on a fairly simple shape: a rectangular piece of fabric that could fall on a slender body without being constrictive in any way. The endless possibilities for embellishments often including sequins and beads in the most amazing designs,  more than ever allowed women to explore and express their style and identity.

Because of the simplicity of the cut and construction, these garments lent themselves well to being made at home, and many magazines proposed patterns to facilitate the reproduction of the fashionable look. The dresses also allowed women to show some parts of their body for the very first time in history: it is said that flappers would apply blush to their kneecaps to draw attention to the legs, which now could be seen thanks to shorter skirts and greater freedom of movement.

Completing the look, flappers were often seen sporting bold makeup and short hair in daring ‘bobs’, protected by cloches during the day and decorated with trims and feathers.

Now, who dressed these young bright things madly dancing the charleston during endless nights of partying? French designer Jean Patou is credited to be one of the first to create “flapper silhouettes” to be worn in Europe and, most importantly, to be exported to the wealthyUnited States of America. Other talented designers too contributed to the success of the streamlined silhouette and ‘boyish’ attitude to clothing, as famously did Coco Chanel.

Apart from France and America, the style conquered the rest of Europe as well, with countless fashion houses and boutiques issuing their interpretation of the flapper dress that eventually became the symbol of a global attitude towards changing times.

Even historical couture houses such as Worth and Poiret explored the flapper style, as did Madeleine Vionnet and Elsa Schiaparelli, who later turned this rather simple silhouette into the glamorous and sensuous bias-dresses accentuating the bodies of the Femme Fatales: the new women of the 1930s.

Several widely studied grave ensembles were found in the Antinoöpolis necropolis, among them the grave of 'the Embroideress Euphemia'. This blog tells her story.

At the end of the Nineteenth Century the French archaeologist Albert Gayet excavated a few fascinatingly unique graves in Egypt. Gayet had been sent to Egypt to do excavations in Antinoöpolis, a city founded by Emperor Hadrian in 130 AD. Gayet not only excavated the temple of Ramses II in that region, but also cleared the fascinating Coptic necropolis of Antinoöpolis.

Several widely studied grave ensembles were found in the Antinoöpolis necropolis, among them the graves of goldsmith Kolluthos and his wife Tisoia, and also the grave ensemble of 'the Embroideress Euphemia'.

Euphemia wasn't mummified along the tradition of the Ancient Egyptians which included removing organs from the body. Euphemia is a 'natural mummy', her body preserved almost impeccably by chance. She was dressed in several tunics, wrapped in shrouds and buried without a coffin. Salt on her skin and clothing had helped the preservation process.

Multidisciplinary research revealed that she was over 40 years old when she died and that she was correctly nourished and hydrated during her life. The number and quality of the clothes and textiles she was buried with, confirm her wealthy social background.

She was identified by Gayet as an ‘embroideress’ because he considered some of the textiles and objects in her grave to be embroideries and embroidery tools. Afterwards, however, they turned out to be tapestry fabrics, spinning and weaving instruments. In an inscription on a fabric, Gayet thought he recognized the name ‘Euphemiâan’. This inscription was not found later.

‘Euphemia’ recently underwent a significant conservation and restoration treatment, thanks to the generous support of a private sponsor through the King Baudouin Foundation.

The recent examination of all the elements of the grave contents revealed that some textiles have already been restored in the past. On the other hand, some other splendid fabrics have never been treated. Damage, sometimes very significant, was clearly visible and required intervention. In particular it can be observed that the textiles were holed, torn and that their seams were relaxed or loose. The fibres, in turn, are brittle and visibly extremely fragile.

Old restorations performed on several fabrics posed conservation problems. Some threads used for the consolidation of the textile were breaking and therefore no longer fulfilled their role. Other threads, on the other hand, were creating too much tension. These textiles were restored by using small pieces of Japanese paper.

Benfica started as a group of boys who wanted to play football and is now a successful international club in many sports.

This is the story of Benfica, which started as a group of boys who wanted to play football and became an international club.

On 28 February 1904, a group of boys who used to play football in Belém, on the riverside of Lisbon, decided to create a sports club. Sport Lisboa, named after the group, chose the red colour, the eagle, and the motto 'E Pluribus Unum' for its symbols.

They met at the Franco pharmacy, showered in a backyard with a well, and made the public playgrounds of the area their ground.

Despite these poor conditions, they quickly rose to become the only team made up of only Portuguese players to defeat the powerful English players of the Carcavellos Club.

Four years later, the lack of facilities became more acute and the solution appeared in another neighbourhood of the city: the merging with Grupo Sport Benfica, which had headquarters and a field, gave the 'red' team a new home, a new name – Sport Lisboa e Benfica – and a new incentive to become even greater.

In the 1910s, Benfica confirmed its position as the best club in the capital after winning three Lisbon Championships in a row twice.

Fame spread throughout the country in the 1930s, with the conquest of the National Championship three times in row for the first time. It was the first of many.

Still the world had to be conquered - a feat Benfica pulled off in the 1960s. The club achieved stardom with two consecutive wins in the European Champions Clubs’ Cup and became a regular presence in this competition.

The symbol of the eagle achieved international recognition and the name Benfica came to be pronounced in all the languages of the world.

It may have been football that gave the Club its international dimension, but Benfica’s sporting success is eclectic.

Over the course of the club’s history, there have been more than 40 sports practiced in the stadium, pavilion, track, road, and water, in collective or individual sports. What started with the first athletics races, with associate members competing, and cycling achievements around Portugal, grew with gymnastics and swimming. These were consolidated by crowded pavilions supporting the winning team in several sports.

With more than 100 years of history,  the club is inseparable from the history of Lisbon, Portugal, and the world. The history of each athlete, leader and supporter are the memories and expressions of the community.

The rich heritage of the club - material and immaterial - is today recognised as essential in the protection and reinforcement of its identity. Preserving, appreciating and communicating this heritage is the mission of the Cultural Heritage Department of Sport Lisboa e Benfica.

Taking care of the past, we guarantee the future and, in the Benfica Museum - Cosme Damião, to different generations, we share the history and values which made Benfica the club that it is today.

A gesture by Polish pole vaulter Władysław Kozakiewicz at the 1980 Olympics was seen as political

The 1980 Olympic Games - the XXII Olympiad - took place in Moscow in the Soviet Union, from 19 July to 3 August. These games were politically fraught, boycotted by representatives of 63 countries as a result of the Soviet–Afghan War.

Following the inauguration of the Games at Łużniki Stadium, 5,217 athletes took part in 203 events, setting 36 world records, 39 European records and 74 Olympic records.

One of the most famous events taking place at these Games was the pole vaulting competition - a track and field event in which a person uses a long flexible pole as an aid to jump over a bar.

The Polish pole vaulter Władysław Kozakiewicz came to Moscow as a favourite, having won multiple European championships in the years before these Olympics.

However, on the day, conditions in the stadium were not in his favour.

The audience were very disapproving of non-Soviet athletes, jeering and shouting at foreign competitors. Even the organisers of the Games tried to influence the results by opening and closing the stadium's gate, caused the wind direction - crucial for pole vaulting - to change.

Despite these efforts, Kozakiewicz won, with successful jumps of 5.70m, 5.75m and 5.78m, guaranteeing him the Olympic gold medal. With his last jump, Kozakiewicz broke the world record.

After that successful jump, Kozakiewicz made a gesture which was written into the history books.

The 'Kozakiewicz gesture' as it became known is made by bending an arm in an L-shape, with the fist pointing upwards, while the other hand then grips the biceps of the bent arm as it is emphatically raised to a vertical position.

The gesture was considered offensive. In Poland, it is also called 'wała' (which translates as shaft). In France, it is known as a bras d'honneur (France), and the Iberian slap or Italian salute elsewhere.

Photographs and footage of Kozakiewicz with his gesture flashed around the world, causing repercussions between Poland and Soviet Union. Boris Aristov - then the USSR Ambassador to Poland - demanded that Kozakiewicz be stripped of his golden medal and banned for life from any future Olympics.

Others have interpreted the gesture as a symbol of overcoming the bar or a gesture of joy from Kozakiewicz. The Polish authorities gave an official statement saying that Kozakiewicz had muscle cramp.

His gesture was supported in Poland, which in the early 1980s was seeing many labour strikes against Soviet control over Eastern Europe, which led to the creation of Solidarity trade union soon afterwards.

Politics played a role in Kozakiewicz’s later life. As part of the Soviet-led boycott of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, Poland did not participate. He defected to West Germany in 1985 but his career was hampered by the Polish authorities. He retired in 1989, later becoming a member of Gdynia city council between 1998 and 2002.

How LGBTQ+ people and communities have been represented in 20th century media

The path toward fair representation of LGBTQ+ people has proven to be a long and daunting one. In this blog, we look at the representation of the LGBTQ+ community in photography and film throughout the 20th Century.

Even though homosexuality gradually gained visibility in popular culture from the early 1900s onwards, early depictions mostly involved cross-dressing or gender-bending as an element of comedy.

This practice was halted by the Motion Picture Code, issued in 1930 and effective until 1968. This set of rules for what was permitted and excluded from the big screen included ‘general principles’ and ‘particular applications’ aiming at preventing films to ‘lower moral standards’.

Though not explicitly mentioned, homosexuality or any suggestion of same-sex relationships were forbidden under the denominator ‘sexual perversion’, as were interracial relationships and any positive portrayals of sexual relations outside of the marriage. Henceforth LGBTQ+ characters would continue to exist in metaphors, suggestions and implications, but not as a real and realistic reflection of societal diversity.

Queer characters and relationships were often associated with crime, illness or anti-social behaviour - rhetoric that only strengthened during World War II. In 1952 the film ban was followed by The Code of Practices for Television Broadcasters, used until 1983 to prevent depictions of homosexuality on tv.

The codes of the American film and television studios started to erode from the early 1960s onwards, heavily influenced by European movies questioning gender bias and discrimination. A Taste of Honey, a British film directed by Tony Richardson, was one of the motion pictures addressing the reality of homosexuals, single mothers and people in mixed-race relationships.

The end of the decade saw more complex and intricate LGBTQ+ depictions by independent cinema such as that ofAndy Warhol. Furthermore, after the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City, the LGBTQ+  community was discovered as a possible lucrative movie market (‘the pink pound’).

Even though stereotypical depictions didn’t cease to exist, the occurrence of gay protagonists increased and issues at the core of the community - such as AIDS, same-sex marriage and adoption - became cinematic themes.

In Gefahr für die Liebe a love triangle turns into a network of support when one of the protagonists has been diagnosed with AIDS.

Piotr Łazarkiewicz’Pora na czarownice(‘Time for witches’) features a female prostitute and a homosexual boy, both HIV positive, who become a couple and try to deal with aggressive opposition of a local community.

As the late 1990s marked the beginning of meaningful LGBTQ+ representation, showing gay people in a positive, family-related context remained exceptional well into the 21st century: gay characters were often portrayed as threatening family life instead of instigating relationships.

Fair representation, just as legislation and societal acceptance, remain the topic of activism on behalf of the LGBTQ+ community. Between the rigid and dichotomous concepts of a nuclear family and a group of friends among which the main driver appears to be sexual innuendo, an unbiased depiction of ‘the queer family’ formed on the basis of mutual affection and appreciation has yet to become mainstream.

Exploring the scientific and artistic careers of Ludwig van Beethoven, Louis Braille, Mileva Marić, and Francisco de Goya

On 14 October 1992, the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed the 3 December as the International Day of Persons with Disabilities. This day highlights how disability inclusion in our society is essential to respect human rights and to improve common social justice.

In relation to this principle, it is crucial to be aware of how people with disabilities continue their professional career to build a better future for all.

In this blog, we explore the scientific and artistic careers of Ludwig van Beethoven, Louis Braille, Mileva Marić, and Francisco de Goya.

Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827) was one of the most important figures in the history of Western music. During his career, he worked as a pianist, arranger, teacher and composer. Some of his most well-known pieces are the Piano Sonata no. 14 called ‘Moonlight Sonata’, the Bagatelle no 25 called ‘Für Elise’, the Third Symphony called ‘Heroic Symphony’, the Fifth Symphony or Destiny Symphony and the Ninth Symphony or Choral.

From an early age, Beethoven had hearing problems, which deteriorated later in life. In 1802, when his deafness was increasing, he suffered a huge depression until his last days. Then, he wrote what is known as the Heiligenstadt Testament. In this letter to his brothers, he explained that he contemplated taking his own life, but he believed his artistic career should not end at this moment.

Despite his disability, Beethoven went on to complete most of his works like the 9th Symphony – assisted by hearing aids and his sense of rhythm and harmony.

Louis Braille (1809-1852) was a French teacher and inventor of one of the most extended systems of reading and writing used by blind people.

Louis Braille was only 3 years old when one day, helping his father in his leather workshop, he had an accident with an awl. Following this event, his eye was infected and finally, he lost sight in one of his eyes. Later on, due to a sympathetic ophthalmia, he lost sight from his other eye.

During his school days, he learnt the Haüy system, a way for visually impaired students to read and write based on the shape and depth of letters. This system was uncomfortable because of the size and the weight of the books and was difficult to learn. Louis Braille became a teacher of history, geometry and algebra.

In 1821, from Captain Charles Barbier of the French Army, he learnt a system of communication based on 9 points. This system was adapted by Braille to 6 points and published in 1829 – the first version of the Braille system. Later on, he adapted it for musical notation.

Since then, Braille has been adapted for typewriting and computers. Nowadays millions of visually impaired people from all over the world have used braille in their education and day-to-day life.

Mileva Marić (1875-1948) was a brilliant Serbian mathematician and theoretical physicist. The scientific advances made together with her husband, Albert Einstein, led to him being awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921.

Mileva Marić was born with a congenital disease which gave her a limp. For this reason, in her school days, she had issues with social interaction.

At university, she started to study medicine but changed to study physics and mathematics. She studied at a university at a time when female students were not very common. At this time, she met Albert Einstein who became her husband and workmate.

Although she developed brilliant works on theoretical physics, Albert Einstein did not recognise her widely as a co-author of his works. The only reference Einstein made to their work is in letters they sent each other.

Despite a difficult childhood and living in a time when women were not recognised for their scientific advances, Mileva dedicated her life to science –  a great example of her perseverance.

Francisco de Goya (1746-1828) was one of the most important Spanish artists in the history of art. He worked as a painter for the upper-class aristocracy in Spain like Count of Floridablanca and the Duchess of Alba among others, before working for the Spanish royal family under Kings Charles III and Charles IV.

Goya went to school in Zaragoza and was an apprentice to the painter José Luzán. Some years later, he moved to Madrid to study with Raphael Mengs and tried to be accepted into the Royal Academy of Art. In 1770, he moved to Italy but, in 1773, he came back to Spain to work with Francisco Bayeu developing his own style based on neoclassical and rococo styles.

During the 1770s and 1780s, he painted major religious artworks. From 1783, he worked for the upper-class aristocracy painting portraits. In the late 1780s, he started to work for the Royal Family of Spain.

From 1792 to 1793, Goya is thought to have suffered from a serious disease which left him deaf, as well as possibly making him deeply anxious. This coincided with the most important period of de Goya’s career, painting the disasters of the Peninsular War, the caprices, and the portrait of King Charles IV of Spain. Some of these works like Los Caprichos are related to the time when he suffered a huge depressive episode. For this reason, during this period, there are lights and shadows in his artworks – from formal portraits to artworks connecting with his darkest feelings.

Artist Johan Hendrik van Mastenbroek captures the gigantic Zuiderzee construction works.

With the majority of the Netherlands at or below sea level, the Dutch have battled the seas for centuries.

Along the Dutch coast, systems of dykes and barriers have been built, some of which have been in place for centuries.

One of the most ambitious of these - the Zuiderzee works - was built in the early 20th century.

In the wake of devastating flooding in 1916, the Dutch government decided to close off theZuiderzeesea with a system of dams and dikes, land reclamation and water drainage work, creating instead an inland sea.

Massive construction works took place through the 1920s and 1930s to build this system - including the main dam - the Afsluitdijk - which opened in September 1933.

These construction works inspired artist Johan Hendrik van Mastenbroek whose paintings and sketches from the time capture the gigantic extent of the project.

The dissolution of the Jewish communities of the Arab world is commemorated on November 30.

The 20th century has seen massive demographic shifts around the globe. Some are well known, like the millions of Europeans who crossed the Atlantic to seek fortune in North America, or the upheaval caused by the partition of the Indian subcontinent in 1947.

Others, however, have remained less noted, like the dissolution of theJewish communities of the Arab worldwhich is commemorated every year on November 30.

In 1947 it was estimated that over a million Jews lived in the Middle East and North Africa. Many of these communities had been existing for centuries and formed an integral part of the larger Arab societies in which they lived.

In the first half of the 20th century Jewish communities flourished throughout the Arab world, with the European interest in the Middle East and North Africa bringing new economic and educational opportunities.

Furthermore, Jewish philanthropic organizations such as theAlliance Israélite Universelle, theAnglo-Jewish Association, and theAmerican Joint Distribution Committeepartnered with local communities to build schools, develop vocational training programs and provide medical care.

Yet from 1947 until 1973, these communities were uprooted, and today virtually no Jews are left in the Arab world.  The reasons for the emigration of Jews from the Arab world are numerous. Some left due to the creation of the State of Israel in 1948. Although many also left as a result of local, political, and economic instability caused by decolonisation and nationalist movements.

The majority of Jews from the Arab world migrated to Israel as this was the only country that would accept them. Some were forced to flee with barely the clothes on their backs, whereas others had more time to prepare for their departure.

Many Jews from North Africa managed to immigrate into France, thanks to the 1870Crémieux Decreegranting French citizenship to  Jews living in the coastal region of Algeria. Others were able to settle in  Europe owing to their education in French, English or Italian.

Today, France has the third-largest Jewish community in the world, due to the wave of North African Jewish immigrants in the 1960s and 1970s.

By the close of the 20th century, only a few thousand Jews still lived in the Arab world. However, their rich cultural heritage continues to be preserved wherever their communities have resettled.

The Stvor camp was part of the Soviet GULag system from the 1940s to 1972.

Forced labour is an often marginalised aspect of labour history.

This blog looks at the Stvor (Створ) camp, which was part of the Soviet GULag system. The term GULag is an acronym for what is known as the Central Administration of Education and Labour Camps of the Soviet Union. In its colloquial use, ‘the Gulag’ is used for the overall system of repression in the era of Stalin’s rule.

Stvor was founded at the bank of the Chusovaya river (Чусовaя), following the decision by the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD) from the 27 November 1942 to build a number of hydro-electric dams and small-scale power plants in the region. Stvor remained in operation until 1972, although the construction of the dam for which it was established was halted in 1944 and never finished.

The camp was situated far away from any settlements or infrastructure. The nearest city - Chusovoy (Чусовой) in the Cis-Ural region Perm (Пермь) - is  25 kilometres away. A railway station Vsesvjatskaja (Всесвятская), which served the camp during its operation, is 18 kilometres away. Stvor was part of an extensive network of smaller and bigger forced labour camps and prisons in the region.

Because of its remoteness, the inmates had to build the whole camp infrastructure from the ground up by themselves. Maintaining the camp was in itself an integral part of the forced labour system of Stvor.

In the beginning, the prisoners – whose number quickly rose from around 1,300 in late 1942 to 6,700 people in 1943 – lived in tents, as the camp was supposed to only serve the temporary construction site. The prisoners had to fell and process trees, work the steep bank into terraces, build the camp infrastructures, and lay the groundwork of the dam.

When it became clear that the camp would be turned into a permanent forced labour camp, several wooden and brick buildings were set up. These buildings are the most visible remains that can be found today.

Since the camp's closure in 1972, weather, vegetation, erosion and vandalism have changed the historical site. Scattered across the terrain are objects from different time periods of the camp: barbed wire, enamel cups, tools and even leather shoes. Nowadays, the former road between railway station and camp is only accessible for heavy all-terrain vehicles. Today, for most people, the former campsite can only be reached by travelling the Chusovaya river.

The history of the camp is tightly connected to the ideas in the Soviet Union to dominate nature and rapidly industrialise, after the civil war following the 1917 October Revolution. So-called ‘Great Construction Projects of Communism’ were launched in the 1930s and 1940s. They often relied on the use of forced labour and were therefore organised by the GULag. From 1917 until the death of Stalin in 1953, about 18 million people were detained. After 1953, the number of camps and prisoners decreased. Under the new leadership and the course of ‘de-Stalinization’, the GULag was officially dissolved and the repressive system changed its form.

As captured in the propaganda term ‘perekovka’ (перековка), hard labour was supposed to ‘re-forge’ the inmates into supporters of the Soviet system – creating the ‘New Soviet Person’. The Soviet theory of crime assumed that crime was rooted in social circumstances. By changing these circumstances and through working, people could accordingly be re-educated and transformed into the Soviet ideal. In criminological theory and everyday camp life, work and re-education were inseparably linked – yet with different inclinations for ‘criminal’ and ‘political’ prisoners. The Bolshevik idea of the fundamental changeability of nature, man and society was closely related to this.

During the 20th century, in many countries - and particularly in the USSR - large-scale hydro-technical constructions were important propaganda to show proposed accelerated industrialisation and all-encompassing transformation. An especially prestigious Soviet hydro-technical project of this era was the Volga-Kama cascade (Волжско-Камский каскад), the construction of various water reservoirs and power plants on the river courses of the Volga and its tributary river Kama.

The first of the planned hydro-electric power plants was completed in 1937 near Ivankovo (Иваньково). To realise these projects, a camp complex with almost 200,000 camp prisoners and forced labourers was established. The ambitious goal of these undertakings was to transform the entire course of the Volga river into a cascade of power plants. Not all the hydro-technical construction projects of the 1930s and 40s, however, were of such gigantic dimensions. Various small-scale projects were planned in all regions of the Soviet Union.



Since the Perm Region has a vast amount of water and rivers, three middle-sized hydro-electric dams and a number of smaller-sized dams were planned, with the respective establishment of a forced labour camp complex. The respective NKVD decision of 1942 also needs to be seen in the context of the German attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, the following evacuation of industries from the Western parts of the country and the related increase in energy demand in areas of the USSR that were less industrialized up to this point. The dam projects were named Ponyshstroy (Понышстрой), Vilukhstroy (Вилухстрой) and Shirokstroy (Широкстрой).

Stvor was established as part of the Ponyshlag camp complex (Понышлаг) for the Ponyshstroy project. Of the three launched building projects, only the Shirokovskaya dam (Широковская ГЭС) was completed and is still in use today.

The construction work at the Ponyshstroy was halted in 1944 to redirect the work and the materials to Shirokstroy. In 1948, the dam construction plans were finally abandoned. At the end of World War II, Stvor was temporarily used as a so-called ‘filtration camp’ for Red Army soldiers returning home from German prisoner of war-camps who were treated as alleged ‘traitors’ by Soviet authorities.

From 1948 until the closure in 1972, the official camp status changed several times, the number of prisoners decreased and the use of forced labour in the camp became more diversified.

The prisoners had to build wooden furniture, harvest wood, do metal work and produce bricks. A workshop for disabled inmates was erected, as groups of ‘invalid’ prisoners were transferred to Stvor. Camp guards and staff lived with their families in a small settlement next to the campsite, which was also abandoned in the mid-1970s.

Over the following decades, nature reclaimed most of the site piece by piece. Dense vegetation and harsh climate conditions buried or erased many of the remaining traces of Stvor – yet nature also keeps bringing hidden remnants to light.

Infrastructure materials and objects were carried away by the local population and people travelling the river during summer. The few visitors arriving at the site today may find it difficult to identify the remains as traces of a former labour camp.

In the 1990s, the human rights NGO Memorial began to work with the historic camp site. In order to visualise its history and to gain public attention for the in-today's- Russia marginalised topic of political repression, forced labour and state terror in Soviet history, they created a ‘Museum Without a Guide’ in the 2000s.

Visitors – locals travelling the rivers or activists – are invited to participate in researching and shaping the places of memory of the Soviet repressive system along the rivers of the Perm Region. Memorial has named this activist form of remembrance ‘Along the rivers of memory’ (По рекам памяти). Self-made direction signs and information boards provide information on the site of Stvor.

A deeper archaeological exploration and historiographical analysis of Stvor remains difficult due to the restricted accessibility of both the site itself and archival materials as well as lacking financial resources and government support. Hence the future of Stvor and its place in the national or regional culture of remembrance in post-Soviet Russia remains uncertain.

By the 1970s, Donnay were the world's leading tennis racket manufacturer.

For tennis players, their choice of racket is all-important - influenced by game-play, precision and, in some cases, superstition.

Donnay is a tennis racket brand favoured by many players - from dedicated amateurs to world champions.

Founded in 1910 by Belgian Emile Donnay, the company initially made wooden handles for tools.

From a small family business with a staff of six based in Couvin, Belgium, they began to diversify to wooden sporting goods, including gymnatic equipment and bows for archery.

Beginning in 1934, the company began to manufacture wooden tennis rackets. The name Donnay became synonymous with tennis and success, in particular when they signed a deal, in the 1950s, to make rackets for major American sporting equipment producers.

By the 1970s, Donnay was the world's largest manufacturer of tennis rackets. Donnay sponsored globally famous champion players such as Rod Laver, Margaret Smith Court and Cliff Drysdale, all of whom played with Donnay's rackets.

Following his first Grand Slam win in the 1974 French Open, from 1975 until his retirement in 1983, Donany sponsored Björn Borg who played with their rackets in European tournaments.

By the 1980s, Donnay was producing millions of rackets annually, almost all made from ash. They continuted producing wooden racket until 1984. However, the company failed to adapt to the growing market for graphite rackets which ultimately led to the company's closure in 1988.

Today, after changing ownership a number of times, the Donnay brand is sold around the world - a reminder of the company's role in tennis' rich sporting heritage.

Learn about the precursors of the Reformation, their work and relevance in history.

The Reformation is most commonly known to have started in 1517, when, as legend has it, Martin Luther, a German monk, was reputed to have nailed his (in)famous 95 theses to the door of the church at Wittenberg. This act started a religious revolution across Europe, particularly in light of the fact that Gutenberg’s printing press helped spread Luther’s work and reach many people.

However, not only was Luther not the first to criticise the church, his work would also likely have been received differently if the current of thought had not already been in the process of change. In fact, a lot of the ideas that fuelled the Reformation were voiced well  before 1517.

While Luther, Calvin, Cranmer and others are commonly regarded as the leaders of the Reformation in the first half of the 16th century, their ideas were based on the work of previous reformers.

Here are some of the precursors to the Reformation that are not as well known as Luther, but whose ideas inspired him greatly.

Arnold of Bresciawas one of the first vocal opponents of the political and economic power of the Church.

He was expelled from Italy in 1139 for revolting against the bishop of Brescia. When he was allowed to come back, in the later 1140s, Arnold found himself engaging with another popular revolt, which drove the Pope from the city. He became a figurehead of this revolution, and called for the end of the Church’s involvement in politics. Arnold was hanged, his body was burned, and his remains thrown into the Tiber.

Peter Waldowas a rich merchant who renounced his position in society and wealth to imitate the life of early Apostles.

His teachings were based on the pillars of poverty and simplicity. He gained more and more followers but was not allowed by the Pope to preach. Since he continued his practices, him and his followers were excommunicated in 1184 and constantly persecuted until the Reformation.

Francis of Assisi(or St Francis) was born to a wealthy family, but abandoned his comfortable life to preach. He believed that a life of good work was more important than sermons and teachings.

Interestingly, his teachings were approved by Pope Innocent III, despite being very close to those of the Waldesians (who were excommunicated). It appears that it was his loyalty to the Church and the Pope that led to his approval. It can thus be said that St Francis was a reformer within the Catholic Church. His being allowed to preach shows that the wider Late Medieval Church was also developing new ways to understand the true Christian life. Popes Gregory VII and Innocent III themselves allowed for different teachings and approaches to the true Christian life.

John Wycliffewas an English Theologian who argued that the English Crown should dispossess Church property, since it brought nothing but a sin to this institution. He also accused the Church of corruption and raised issues with its theological doctrines.

He believed that the scriptures should be the main authority, not the church officials. He is recognised alongside others to be the author of the first English Bible.

Jan Huswas a learned priest who studied at the University of Prague where he was inspired by Wycliffe’s teachings.

He spoke against simony (the sale of an office such as bishop, abbot or abbess or even parish priest) and indulgences, stating that man obtains forgiveness of sins by true repentance, not money. He was driven into exile in 1412 and was burned as a heretic in 1415.

The news of the execution of Jan Hus led his followers to rise up, driving many Catholic priests from their parishes. On 30 July 1419 a Hussite mob threw the king’s representatives and city officials out of the window of the City Hall of Prague, henceforth known as the firstPrague defenestration. More than a century after the death of Jan Hus, Martin Luther was inspired by his work and started the greatest revolution in the Church.

History

Literature

Science

Psychology

Ludwig van Beethoven was born on 16 December 1770 in Bonn, Germany, and died on 26 March 1827 in Vienna, Austria. He was a prolific composer but one of his works has become more memorable than others: The Symphony No. 9.

This choral work was chosen in 1972 asthe official anthem of the European Union, with Beethoven’sautographed sheet musicincluded in the UNESCO Memory of the World Register in 2001.

This work can be understood from multiple points of view. So, let’s explore this composition from different perspectives.

Ludwig van Beethoven grew up in a musical family. His musical education started at an early age and he gave his first concert aged 7.

During this time, music lessons were very popular among the upper-classes For this reason during his career, Beethoven, as well as other artists, worked forroyal families, upper-class aristocrats and religious men as a pianist, an arranger, a teacher and a composer.

Internationally, the years of Beethoven’s youth were a revolutionary time. In 1789, the French Revolution began, and some decades later, Napoleon Bonaparte took command of the country.

All these events were charged with values like freedom, equality, fraternity or solidarity. Artists like Beethoven expressed them in his works - moving from well-established harmonies to use new ones based on his feelings. For example, Beethoven composed his 3rd Symphony (called Heroic Symphony), dedicating it to Napoleon.

This is not the only time when he coloured his music with values. The 9th Symphony - a choral work with the text of Friedrich Schiller’s poem ‘An die Freude’ (Ode to Joy) is another extraordinary example of this.

When Beethoven was born, the artistic tendency in Europe was called Classicism. The classic period is identified, among others, by measured forms and topics following the national schools’ guidelines for each country.

Later on, as the same time the French Revolution exploded, young artists like Ludwig van Beethoven, Friedrich Schiller or Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, inspired by new values, started creating his art based only on their own feelings. This is when - in 1786 - Schiller published the poem ‘_An die Freude_’ (Ode to Joy). It symbolises fraternity and equality among the peoples of the world and, due to its deep meaning, became well-known in literary and artistic circles.

In 1793, when Beethoven read it, he loved it and suddenly the idea of composing a choral work with this text came to his mind. However, it was not until 1822 when Beethoven put this inspiration into practice, starting compose his symphony which he finished in 1824.

Music has a close relationship with mathematics and physics.

There are a lot of famous musicians interested in science. Rhythm signs are based on multiples of 2,tempois measured on double or triple beats mixing soft and hard beats like the human heart beats. Harmony is close to the science of sound and how sound waves flow in the air and they are heard by our ears.

Beethoven’s deafness, which has an unknown origin, started very early in his life. It was not a very serious condition until later in life years. Thanks to Beethoven’s hearing aids and his senses of rhythm and harmony, he could complete the 9th Symphony - an example of an artist continuing their career in the face of a disability.

In addition to this disability, Beethoven also suffered a serious depression that accompanied him during all his life. This mental health disorder had a powerful impact on his work.

In his 9th Symphony’s last movement, Beethoven’s musical rhythms and themes comment on his past lifetime and act as an omen of his future. For example, some parts represent ironic moments connected to the meaning of the text and other parts are most like a funeral march rhythm, as if he waits for his own death.

Apart from that, his work is full of examples of how his imagination is related to his feelings, taking for example characters of Fidelio, his unique opera, who reflects Beethoven’s dualities during his life.

Exploring the lives and works of Endre Ady, Gyula Illyés and Sándor Márai

Literature is not only an author’s means of self-expression, but it can transform our perception of spaces and places. This blogs looks at a number of Hungarian writers who have lived and worked abroad, with their literature reflecting their perceptions of their new cities.

For those writers who, for any reason, feel isolated in their native cultural environment, such literary migration can be an option to experiment and explore.

Due to the technological circumstances, most readers in the early 20th century could only perceive giant metropolitan cultural cities through their literary representations. Hungarian authors like Endre Ady or Gyula Illyés gained their most influential experiences in Paris, for example.  However, the very same Paris made highly different impressions on the two poets.

EXPLORE MORE:Gallery: Paris, city of art

Ady immersed himself in the bourgeois nights of Paris, enjoying the city’s pleasures while lamenting on existential questions. One of his most famous poems takes the readers to the scenic boulevard St. Michel.

'Autumn slipped into Paris yesterday, came silently down Boulevard St MichelIn sultry heat, past boughs sullen and still, and met me on its way.'

-Autumn passed through Paris, Endre Ady (translated by Doreen Bell)

Ady’s passion for Paris derived from the cultural buzz of the urban scene. He famously described Nagyvárad (today this is Oradea in Romania), the town where he worked after coming back from Paris as 'Paris on the banks of the Pece'.

EXPLORE MORE:Digitised collections about Endre Ady

On the other hand, Illyés had a stronger emphasis on social issues. Paris – in his eyes – was rather the scene for the grandiose changes in French society.

Moreover, his very reason for moving to Paris was more of a political necessity. He participated in illegal communist formations in the beginning of the century, which resulted in his subsequent political persecution. After amnesty was granted to Illyés, he came back to Hungary with the social experience he had in Paris, and the politically doctrines he acquired from the Marxist thinkers he met.

EXPLORE MORE:Digitised collections about Gyula Illyés

This divergence in their gaze is both reflected in their representation of Paris and their poetic voice. Paris was seen as both a cosmopolitan cultural point of reference and a vivid scene for a potential social transformation.

Sándor Márai, a Hungarian author who lived and worked in Berlin, representing his emigration and an image of the German capital – based on his particular and often biased perceptions.

Due to the geographical proximity, and more importantly, to Hungary’s embedded status in German culture (thanks to the centuries long history with the Habsburg Empire), Germany has been a popular destination for Hungarian artists and writers wanting to broaden their horizons. They spoke the language, and should be familiar with the culture.

EXPLORE MORE:Gallery of views of Berlin

When he moved to Berlin in the 1920s, Márai was initially shocked by the cultural differences. He had a hard time adapting to the cosmopolitan values. At first he found it confusing to deal with cosmopolitan gender roles that so highly differ from the conservative Eastern-European model.

'The confusion of genders rule the fused city. I see women disguised in Prussian military uniform, wearing a monocle, smoking cigars, and some of them go so far that they keep military manuals on their bedside table. Men who are factory owners by day dress up as snake-charmers at night. Berlin wither is a long permanent masquerade.'

-The Confessions of a Haut-Bourgeois, Sándor Márai

Though these descriptions fuelled the scepticism of Hungarian conservatives of the time about the strange, untraditional ways of cosmopolitanism, Márai finally asserts to his readers that development and civil values are the only means of progress, and it does not inevitably result in the distortion of regional customs.

'Always keep West. And never forget that you came from the East.'- Sándor Márai

Márai was inspired by his German colleague, Thomas Mann, as both of them represented humanism and civil values in a menacing time.

Today's technology can help us in getting a complex image on these cultural spaces. The Petőfi Literary Museum in Budapest is digitising exhibitions and collections relating to Hungarian authors who wrote aboard, and in Europeana, we find a large digital collection on migration and cultural life.

Browse a selection of World War I birthday cards and their messages

We often can think of times of war as huge upheavals in humanity. Life can be put on hold. But for many people, day-to-day life does go on with great changes and stresses.

Birthdays during World War I were not always happy times. Loved ones were distant, and the means of communicating with them difficult.

Here, we share some birthday cards and their messages fromEuropeana 1914-1918. Some sent from the front line, some sent to it, some bought, some hand-made, some heart-warming, some heart-breaking.



'Many Happy Returns of the Day'| Gertie

Coming to Europeana fromThe Army Children Archive, in the card titled 'Many Happy Returns of the Day', we see a young girl holding a photograph of her soldier-father.

This card was sent to a 13-year-old girl in October 1916 with the message 'To dear Gertie, With fondest love, from Mam and Dad'.



'To my Dear Daddy away on Duty.'| Nora

From the same archive, this card - 'To my Dear Daddy away on Duty' - includes a handwritten message in black ink: 'Wishing our Dear Daddy a very Bright and happy Birthday with the Best of Good luck and a speedy Return. From your Dear Little Daughters Annie & Nora’.



FRATERNAL GREETINGS| ALG SANDERS

On the other side of the card depicting a lady in green with flowers,a hand-written messagereads 'My Dear Min, Just a little card to wish you everything you wish yourself, + may the "Great Peace" be proclaimed before your next Birthday comes along. Trusting you and Vera are quite well. With kindest thoughts, your affectionate Brother Alg.'



Geburtstagsgrußim Krieg | Oeckermann Mathilde

Perhaps an unlikely birthday card, 'Durchalten', is a card sent to Mathilde Oeckermann from her friends in favour of the association 'Welfare of Female Youth'. In the third year of the war, this card calls for the home front to 'STOP'.



Birthday card| Kay Hodgson

'The Best of Birthday Wishes to my Brother' came to us ina collection from Kay Hodgson, and was sent to George Atkinson Sharp. The poem on it reads 'By this card I would convey, More than all my heart can say. By this love-sent token true, Comes my Birthday wish to you, May good luck your footsteps guide, Health, wealth, joy and love abide.'



Geburtstagsgrüße von Gustav Mülleraus den Vogesen | Emil Arnold

A painter by profession,Gustav Müllerwas a member of the 2nd Replacement Battalion of the 4th Company of the 165th Infantry Regiment. This is a homemade birthday card, made it appears with foliage and straw, sent from Gustav from the field in the Vosges to his sister-in-law in 1918.



Flieger Rudolf Dreher, geb. 1896. Im Flieger als Beobachteram 30.5.1918 über Lille/Frankreich tötlich verwundet.

Sadly, not every card made it to the recipient in the manner intended.

Flyer Rudolf Dreher drew this card for his father, Otto-Hugo Dreher, who would be 50 on 3 September, 1918. The card was discovered and sent to Rudolf's father, along with other items belonging to his son following his death on 30 May 1918.

Silk embroidered cards were made in France and Belgium during the war with thousands bought by soldiers to send home to their loved ones.



'A kiss from your daddy.'| The Army Children Archive

'A kiss from your daddy' includes violets, the Union Jack and the French flag (the ‘Tricolore’).

The central flap lifts to reveal a small rectangular card on which is printed a terrace scene surrounded by four-leafed clovers, along with the legend ‘A Loving Birthday Greetings [sic]’. On the reverse a message written in pencil reads, ‘Dear Daughter,  Just a line to let you know I have sent a P.C. to your Uncle John so with Best of Luck I remain your loving Dad good night tell Mamma’.

Exploring the technology of the Lanterna, the tallest lighthouse in the Mediterranean

The Lighthouse of Genoa, called Lanterna, is a symbol for the city.

At a height of 77 metres (with a focal height of 117 metres), it is the tallest lighthouse in the Mediterranean Sea and the second tallest in Europe (the first is on 82.5 metres tall on Île Vierge, France).

The current tower was built in 1543, but there has been a lighthouse on the site since the 12th century. The lighthouse was modernised and restored during the 20th century and has been open to the public since 1994.

The Lanterna Museum is adjacent to the tower, within the fortifications of the walls of Genoa.

Established in 2006, the museum covers the history of Genoa and its port. The museum exhibits lanterns, lenses and technical instruments to show the workings of the lighthouse and its evolution over time. A collection, dating from the 19th and 20th centuries, describes the various constituent parts of a lighting system with rotating optics for naval signalling.

The collection of technical instruments includes lenses, headlights, flashers, exchangers and valves. All the instruments dated to the first half of the 20th century. Some of them are from the first quarter of the century, before modern electrification (1936).

One of the most ancient and interesting objects is an instrument from the first quarter of the 20th century that uses the Fresnel lens, a type of composite compact lens originally developed by French physicist Augustin-Jean Fresnel for lighthouses.

The Fresnel lens is thinner and lighter compared to a conventional lens because it is divided into a set of concentric annular sections. It can capture more oblique light from a light source. The light from a lighthouse equipped with a Fresnel lens can be visible over greater distances.

Other important scientific instruments show the evolution of the clockwork engine deriving from the mechanics of tower clocks. The collection includes an example of a clockwork for rotating lenses, produced by Alfonso Curci e Figlio in Naples for the Italian Navy in the first quarter of the 20th century.

From the early 20th century, an independent flashing acetal or electromechanical headlight was also produced inItaly.

The collection also contains instruments which are examples of important European industrial history. There are several flashers and exchangers from France, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Germany.

One exchanger was produced by German manufacturer Pintsch Bamag. Founded in 1870 by Julius Pintsch, who was primarily known for the invention of Pintsch gas, this uses a compressed fuel gas for illumination purposes.

A propane flasher made by French producer Clesse Mandet (today Clesse Industries), whose long history originates with a laboratory founded by Georges Clesse in 1850.

Lonkero is a type of drink invented for a sporting ocasion - the 1952 Olympic Games held in Helsinki.

Sporting events are times for celebrations or commiseration, often marked with food and drink.

But in Finland, we find an example of a drink that was invented for a sporting ocasion - the 1952 Olympic Games held in Helsinki.

Lonkero is a Finnish term given to what are known as 'long drinks' - usually drinks mixing spirits such as vodka and gin with fruit-flavoured soft drinks.

In Finland, these popular drinks are sold in supermarkets, bars and restaurants. Gin and grapefruit soda is one of the most popular mixtures, but cranberry, lime and more flavours are available.

These drinks were invented for the summer Olympic Games which were hosted by Helsinki from 19 July to 3 August 1952 - 12 years after the cancellation of the 1940 Olympic Games which were due to be held in Helsinki.

Between 1919 and 1932, prohibition banned the sale of alcohol. This law was brought in as one of the first acts of the Finland as a republic following its independence from Russia. The law was overturned in 1932 following a referendum where 70% of voters chose to remove the restrictions.

Following this, a state-company called Alko was created to control the sale of alcoholic products.

However, with thousands of foreign competitors, media and sports fans coming to Helsinki for the Olympics, the Finnish state loosened the laws.

Alko introduced two pre-mixed, bottled, ready-to-consume long drinks - one with brandy and a fruit / berry soft drink flavour (which has since been discontinued) and the gin and grapefruit drink which continues to be popular today.

Both drinks were easy for bars to sell, as they were pre-mixed and they were developed to appeal to the tastes of foreign visitors.

One of the most popular brands sold today is by Hartwall, a beverage company based in Helsinki that was founded in 1836.

Iridescence and artists

Iridescence and Art Nouveau

Iridescence is a phenomenon where our eyes perceive spectrums of colours, based on how light falls on surfaces. We see iridescence in nature - it can be spotted on some minerals, feathers of some insects, birds, fish, shellfish, and as part of many natural phenomena such as oil films on water and soap bubbles.

Iridescent objects and products made by contemporary manufacturers of glass, ceramics, paint, cosmetics, and even textile might seem as a modern invention - but also reflect some eclectic lustre.

Iridescence can also be seen on specimens of archaeological glass. The phenomenon occurs on them naturally, due to their long time underground, or artificially, due to specific production techniques.

Light is composed of a full continuous array of the colours of the visible spectrum. Each colour surface reflects one part of this electromagnetic spectrum, while the remaining part is absorbed.

We can see this most clearly when white light passes through an optical prism. Each colour leaves the prism following its own wavelength, causing the light to separate into the colours of the spectrum. The colour of an object is determined by absorption, i.e. the reflection of wavelengths of a certain part of the spectrum characteristic of a specific surface.

Iridescence surfaces are usually composed of one or more (semi-) transparent layers.

When white light reaches a thin transparent film (layer or coating), one part of light is reflected from the upper surface of the film while the remaining part from the surface below the layer or layers. When the reflected rays merge (constructive interference), they create the effect of iridescence. What we see depends on our position, the angle at which we are looking at the object and the angle of the ray of light.

As it causes a sensation in the visual system, it is one of perceptual observations that aroused interest among applied artists. Ancient glass on which the phenomenon naturally occurs as thin flakes form on the surface resulting in an overflow of spectral colours have given a special impetus for the creation of the effect of iridescence.

In making glass and ceramics, iridescence can be ‘artificially’ formed by treating the surface with metal oxides and exposure to acid vapours in a reducing atmosphere.

Louis Comfort Tiffany (1848-1933) was an artist and designer, and son of the founder of the famed jewelry producer. He is credited for patenting the production of iridescent glass - Favrile glass (from fabrile, possibly denoting handcrafted origin).

He was influenced by the glass collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum (former South Kensington) during his visit in 1865.

Objects with iridescent properties from theMuseum of Arts and Crafts in Zagrebcollection were manufactured by a variety of designers, artists and glassworks from around Europe and beyond.

There are objects from Louis Comfort Tiffany from the USA, the Austrian firm Pallme-König & Habel, French designer René Jules Lalique, and two glassworks from Bohemia - Wilhelm Kralik Sohn and Löetz - as well as Croatian glassworks such as Osredek.

Lustrous glass objects designed by Croatian painter and sculptress Antonija Krasnik were produced at the Viennese glassworks Bakalowitz und Söhne. Each of these designers and manufacturers, experimenting with their own techniques, developed unique objects and effects.

Iridescence can also be present on ceramics such as the Art Nouveau facade ofKallinaHouse in Zagreb. The iridescent water lilies 'inked' on the building's tiles rise above floral wrought-iron balconies that overlook the street intersection.

However, this iridescent effect can be difficult to spot above the first floor level when standing in front of the building, and, given the effect is 'interactive', it can be difficult to photograph or digitise even in a controlled environment.

The Mostiștei Valley is located in the Southern part of Romania, in Călărași County. It is composed of the main river course and several tributary valleys. The Mostiștea river springs from North of Bucharest and flows into the Danube, after 98 km. Between 1960 and 1970, following an extensive archaeological field research project, over 540 archaeological sites dating from the Stone Age to the 17th century were mapped in the region, therefore the Mostiștei Valley became an incredible archaeological reservation on all its length.

This highly developed hydrographic network, in relation with the Danube river, transformed the micro-region into a very fertile area, creating highly favorable conditions for the development of human communities, even since prehistory. In particular, the most important factor for these conditions was the constant and low current of the river, which didn’t allow the erosion of the banks. Aerial and satellite imagery revealed there were no former meandering or paloechannels, but only a stable course maintained due to the lakes, formed around the river, which took over the higher flows, attenuating the current forming during the heavy rainfall season.

The situation changed starting with the second half of the 20th century. The Romanian Communist regime pursued the development of agriculture by also including in the agricultural circuit as many wet surfaces as possible. This was done by systemizing the river and drying out the puddles and lakes from the meadow area of the Danube. As a consequence, between 1970-1980, Mostiștea river underwent dramatic transformations because of shore embankments and partial river drainage. The accumulation lakes, made by river embankment, caused elevation of the water level, flooding in the lower parts of the valley and the widening of the riverbed, thus the archaeological heritage of the valley was a victim of this action. Because the landscape changed radically, in a very short amount of time, millennial traces of human and natural history disappeared or were put out of context.

Amid the remarkable archaeological sites located in Mostiștei Valley, there were seven multilayered Neolithic settlements, also known as tells, dated between 4500-3900 BC, that belonged to the Gumelnița Culture, also found in Greece, the Balkans and Romania (from the Danube up to the Carpathian Mountains), a predominantly pottery phenomenon. The settlements developed in direct relation with the river, along its course, being located on islets, terraces or into the Danube meadow, at an almost equal distance (around 12-15 km). The remaining tells are „La Movilă”, found at 200 m northeast from Măriuța village, on the right bank of the river and „Movila din cimitir”, found in the cemetery of Șeinoiu village, on the left bank of the river. The other five tells are close to the following villages: Măgureni (eroded), Gherghelăul Mare and Gherghelăul Mic, Vlădiceasca (both completely submerged at 8 m deep by Frăsinet lake), „Malu Roșu”, Sultana, located at 500 m north from the village (70 [%i]estroyed) and „Măgura Fundeanca”, Chiselet, located at 3,5 km away from the Danube.

The archeological sites have very thick deposit layers, measuring 2 to 5 m, and contain rich archaeological material consisting of ceramics containers, flint and bone tools and worship objects. The Sultana settlement offered the most outstanding artifacts in the whole area, such as the Lovers Vessel, the Anthropomorphic Vessel, the Tulips Vessel, the Duck Vessel, and the „Sultana Goddess”.  Also worth mentioning is the golden treasure, made up from five gold idols, a saltaleone necklace, a seven rings ornamental chain and a small ring.

The communist agricultural systematization brought all seven tells in an advanced state of degradation, with some of them lost and the surviving ones eroded, and threatened with destruction. Most probably, in the following decades, the last traces of a prehistoric landscape preserved for six millennia, will disappear.

How social changes of the 20th century have been reflected in Polish film

On the 27th of October, we celebrate the World Day of Audiovisual Heritage. In this blog, we take a peek not only behind but also in front of the scenes, investigating examples of how social changes of the 20th century have been reflected on pellicule.

Thinking about film as an observer and a witness, one can ask about the role of film in depicting and commenting on important social breakthroughs. It is a question not only about cinema itself, but also about its role in society and about ways of using moving images, especially in times of crisis or game changing moments.

In the case of Poland, it is clear that cinema is closely bound to social issues and that social changes translate directly into the history of cinema in an organizational but, above all, in an artistic sense. A good example is one of the trends for which the Polish cinema is known all over the world: ‘the Polish Film School’, created in the 1950s.



Film director Andrzej Munk and screenwriter Jerzy Stefan Stawínski receive a film critics award forEroica: a movie about the Polish concept of heroism, 1959. Filmoteka Narodowa, InC.

This artistic initiative, brought to life by an informal group of Polish film directors and screenplay writers among which Andrzej Wajda and Andrzej Munk, was cinema's response to the trauma of the Second World War. In their works, associated movie directors portray war not as a historical event, but as a struggle of ideas, a romantically understood clash between good and evil, in which man finds himself in a tragic position with no way out.

This was especially reflected in the visual identity of films, which referred to arts, literature, poetry, and any artistic realm expliciting emotional states.



Movie director Andrzej Munk filmingZezowate szczęście(‘Bad luck’), 1959. Filmoteka Narodowa, InC.

At the time, film became an exponent of the spiritual state of society suffering from or ascending after a great trauma. To reflect the emotional character, the Polish Film School was creating films of a metaphorical nature, with only limited interest in realism as such.

The reaction of Polish cinema to the experience of war was profound and multidimensional. Cinema was no longer just entertainment, but increasingly became a socially significant art in which directors actively took a stand in public debates. The hero in these movies was portrayed as a young, noble, spiritual man, with the disposition of a poet, devoting himself to the idea of a greater good.

The characteristics of such a protagonist insocialist-realist films(aka Socrealism) were clearly present in Andrzej Wajda’sMan of Marble(1977). Socrealism itself was the idea of a brave new world, built on the ruins of the old one, using youth as a symbol of a modern, progressive political system. Through artistic films of the Polish Film School, Wajda has shown the impropriety of that idea: young people, soldiers, in his films are the victims of the war, damaged by it and unable to find a place in this new world because they are treated like enemies and as representing the previous regime. That's why Maciek Chełmicki in Wajda'sDiamond and Ashes(1958)  dies in a garbage dump: a strong symbol of a wasted generation.

The reaction of Polish cinema to the anti-communist revolution of 1989 was similar: filmmakers again resorted to metaphors to show the spiritual dimension of this breakthrough, which interested them more than the realistic one. Examples include films by Wojciech Marczewski (Escape from the «Liberty» CinemaorThe Crowned-Eagle Ringby Andrzej Wajda.



From Wojciech Marczewski’sEscape from the «Liberty» Cinema, 1990. Filmoteka Narodowa, InC.

It remains a paradox that the use of the same procedure that created the Polish Film School, namely the use of metaphors, referencing the reservoir of spiritual culture, did not yield a similar result. To the contrary, the transformation of 1989, as a great social game changer, was not so much undertaken by artistic Polish filmmakers. The hero of the mass imagination became a hero as seen in commercial cinema, breaking ethos and rejecting values, bitterly experienced by life, violent, cynical, vulgar.



Scene from Waldemar Krzystek’s Ostatni prom, 1989. Filmoteka Narodowa, InC.

This paradox of Polish cinema as a reaction to social change remains a particular example of the complex nature of the relationship between social sentiment and the ability of filmmakers to create stories about socially relevant phenomena. And, above all, it helps to show the power of cinema to share and pass on meaningful stories.

Read about the prominent influence that Italian archeologists had in the local history and heritage of Dodecanese islands.

Discussing occupation of territory by foreign forces has always been a thorny, controversial topic to write about. This isn't any different when it comes to the Italian occupation of the Dodecanese islands. In the early 20th century, after the Italian-Turkish War of 1911, the Italian government occupied this Greek group of about 165 islands off the coast of Turkey. Most of the colonial forces settled on the largest islands: Rhodos, Kos, and the neighbouring Crete.

The Dodecanese had been occupied by foreign forces unbroken for 740 years when they were united with Greece after the Second World War, in 1947.  A lot can be said about occupation of the Dodecanese islands, but in this blog we'll focus on the prominent influence that Italian archeologists in the Dodecanese had in the local history and heritage of the island group.



Dodecanese, church, site unknown, M. Paolini. University of Bologna, InC-EDU.

Italian archaeologists contributed in no small part to the uncovering of many new archeological sites during their occupation of the islands. the historianGiuseppe Gerolawas commissioned to draw up an inventory of the ancient monuments discovered on the Italian-ruled Greek territories. During the two and a half years (early 1900 - July 1902) he spent there,  he collected a vast body of material, which he then edited between 1905 and 1932.



Giuseppe Gerola, University of Bologna, InC-EDU

In 1909 theItalian School of Archaeology at Athenswas founded with the aim of coordinating archaeological investigations in Greece. In 1914 the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs commissionedAmedeo Maiurito direct a permanent archaeological mission in the Dodecanese. Amedeo's quest was to discover and explore new monuments and artefacts as well as to protect and restore already uncovered heritage sites.



Rhodes, Lindos, acropolis (1912), University of Bologna, InC-EDU.

Maiuri led this mission for ten years, after which he would become the chief archaeologist at Pompeii and gained his fame in the revolutionary archaeological work he would do on the excavations of that city.

In order to promote the research activities in the Dodecanese, Italian institutions established study grants for young archaeologists, whose papers were published in scientific journals such as the “Memorie dell’Istituto Storico-Archeologico di Rodi”. In the early 1930’s, archaeologists asLuciano Laurenziand Luigi Morricone carried on significant research in Rhodes and in Kos. In april of 1933, a short but devastating earthquake shook the island of Kos, razing the city of Kos and claiming 170 lives. This earthquake did unearth a lot of old Greco-Roman archaeological sites. Laurenzi and other Italian archaeologists worked in tandem with the rebuilding effort to conduct significant archaeological excavations in the following years.

With the outbreak of WWII, most of the on-going investigations had to stop. During the following years the main purpose of the Italian scholars was to safeguard and to hide the inestimable finds they discovered there from the destruction of war. This courageous and risky mission showed its results after the end of the conflict, when the coordination of the research activities was given to Greek institutions and the good state of preservation of monuments and artefacts was verified.

Still today, traces of the Italian interventions of  preservation and promotion of the cultural heritage of the Dodecanese can be found in museums, restoration projects and depots all around the islands.

Learn more about seven smaller European towns that you may not already know

Europe's cities are famed attractions for visitors from around the world - whetherchic Paris, beautifulVeniceor historicBudapest.

Away from the cities, however, across Europe many smaller towns are home to beautiful sights and fascinating local heritage.

Let's learn more about seven smaller European towns that you may not already know.

Cariño is a town in the northwestern Spanish province A Coruña. It is a coastal town, located on a tidal inlet of the Ría de Ortigueira y Ladrido.

The coast nearby Cariño has some of the highest cliffs in Europe.

Kinsale, a town in County Cork in Ireland, is known for its restaurants and gastronomy.

Just outside the town, at the Old Head of Kinsale headline, stands a lighthouse - one of the first lighthouses to be built in Ireland following permission granted by King Charles II in 1665.

The name Edam is known around the world due to the cheese named after the town.

A regular cheese market has been held in the town for centuries, since Emperor Charles V first granted the right for this in 1526.

For centuries, the town, to the north of Amsterdam, stood on the sea coast of the Zuiderzee, with shipbuilding and fishing being an important part of the town's heritage. Since the early 20th century, the Zuiderzee has been enclosed to prevent flooding and is now an inland sea, the IJsselmeer.

Fiskars in the south of Finland is another place which has given its name to a company known throughout the world.

Fiskars developed around ironworks founded in 1649 which developed through the 18th and 19th centuries to become a world-leading company. Fiskars itself was the site of mills, workshops and factories.

The company is no longer located in Fiskars. Today, those buildings are home to artists, artisans and designers, and Fiskars is a popular tourist destination.

Bușteni is a small town in Romania, located in the Prahova Valley surrounded by the Bucegi mountains.

This gives the town spectacular views, and today it is a popular mountain resort for skiing and mountain hiking.

On top of one of these mountains stands the Commemorative Cross of the Romanian Heroes from World War I, a memorial which was completed in 1928.

Marsaxlokk is a vibrant fishing port in Malta, with a weekly fish market on the Mediterranean seafront.

The port has been inhabited for centuries and used by Phoenicians and Carthaginians. The name Marsaxlokk comes from the Arabic wordmarsa, which means port andxlokk, which is the Maltese word for south-east.

Perast in Montenegro is a town located on the Bay of Kotor.

Perast was an important trading town for the Venetian Republic, and is known for its baroque architecture. For a small town with one main street, there are 16 churches and 17 former grand palazzi.

Giovanni Battista Belzoni

Learn about the Italian Egyptology pioneers: Ippolito Rosellini, Giuseppe Angelelli, and the impressively named Giovanni Battista Belzoni.

If you think about archaeology, one of the first countries that might come to mind is Egypt. Italian archaeology pioneers and travellers helped rediscover Egypt and its ancient history in the 19th Century, making way for the thriving study of Italian Egyptology in the centuries to follow. Among these Italian Egyptology pioneers were Ippolito Rosellini, Giuseppe Angelelli, and the impressively named Giovanni Battista Belzoni.

The history of Ancient Egypt had been written and discussed in the Ancient Historical time period by Egyptians themselves, like the Egyptian priestManetho. Ancient Greeks and Romans referenced the Egyptian civilisations as well:Herodotus,StraboandPliny the Elderall described Egyptian culture at length. Egypt kept on being of interest to travellers and historians in the Middle Ages and Early Modern time periods, but Modern Egyptology as it is currently known originated in the 18th and 19th centuries. A rising interest in Ancient Egypt around the end of the eighteenth century pushed scientists, explorers, artists, adventurers to colonise and collect the treasures found in the Fertile Crescent, while establishing the basics of Egyptology.

In the nineteenth century several Italians became pioneers of colonisation and discovery that would shape the field of Egyptology for the coming centuries. The Italian Ippolito Rosellini is seen as the father of Italian Egyptology after publishingI Monumenti dell'Egitto e della Nubia. The book comprised 3300 pages of text and almost 400 illustrated plates.

A lot of the drawings and sketches in Rosellini's book were of the hand of Giuseppe Angelelli, another Italian whose paintings and drawings became important parts of the study of Egyptology. Angelelli's reproductions of Ancient Egypt were also, arguably, beautiful works of art.

Belzoniwas a pioneer of Egyptology, sometimes referred to as "the Great Belzoni". He studied as a hydraulic engineer but first earned his living in theatrical performances as a strongman. After that, he travelled through France, the Netherlands, England and finally to Egypt where he was immediately fascinated by the Pharaonic ruins.

He accomplished three archaeological trips to Egypt in 1816, 1817, and 1819. He was met with differing degrees of hospitality on these trips, sometimes easily establishing friendships and sometimes clashing brutally with diplomats, explorers and other archaeologists.

Belzoni's engineering knowledge came in handy when he came upon the task of removing and transporting a colossal stone bust weighing more than 7 tons from the Ramesseum in the plain of Deir el-Bahari near ancient Thebes. The bust had to be moved all the way to the Nile, about 1200 meters away, where it could be loaded onto a boat and shipped to England. It took Belzoni 17 days, 130 men, and several smart engineering tricks to drag the bust of 'The Young Memnon' to the river. The bust is still on display in the British Museum today.

Belzoni was the first to open up the tomb of Sethi I, father of Ramses II, in the Kings’ Valley, decorated with magnificent bas-reliefs and polychrome frescoes of which he made splendid graphic moulds. He was also the first to penetrate into the second pyramid of Giza, cleared the temple at Abu Simbel of sand, and discovered the ruins of the mythical city of Berenice on the Red Sea.

His journeys to Egypt were narrated in the bookNarrative of the Operations and Recent Discoveries Within the Pyramids [...], beautifully illustrated by the physician and artist Alessandro Ricci. Did you know that director George Lucas probably drew inspiration from the many-sided personality of Belzoni to give birth to the Indiana Jones figure? We don't know Belzoni's stance on snakes, and neither did he find the Ark of the Covenant on his travels, but Belzoni's last voyage could have been the subject of a Hollywood movie: he set out to find the legendary city of Timbuktu in Mali. This quest would be Belzoni's last, though: Belzoni died of dysentery in 1823, having gotten no further than the port of Gwato in the Gulf of Benin.

Looking at words and phrases used in languages across Europe to describe weather

Europe is a continent of complex and diverse geographies, with several different climatic zones and undoubtedly diverse weather across the region.

With changeable weather conditions across the continent, many unique words and phrases have developed describing weather. Let's take a look at these, and find some similarities between different countries and languages.

In Ireland, the beautiful expression 'a soft day' is used to describe a day of light, drizzling rain. If this is weather you particularly enjoy, you can declare it to be 'a grand soft day'.

Artists have been portraying stunning Dutch skies in paintings, drawings, photographs and more for centuries.

In some of these, we can see the Dutch expression 'een mager zonnetje', a pale powerless sun.

In Polish, the month of April is referred to in the phrase 'kwiecień plecień, bo przeplata trochę zimy, trochę lata': April is a plait, because it interweaves a little winter and a little summer.

Some expressions are more regional and local.

In the Erzgebirge region of Germany, the expression 'Dämse' is used for hot and humid conditions.

In Scotland, ‘dreich’ is used to describe dreary, bleak weather, while ‘haar’ is a sea fog specific to the west coast of Scotland and northern England.

A number of languages have phrases to describe when it is really raining.

In English, it is 'raining cats and dogs', but nobody is really sure where the phrase comes from despite a number of potential origins. While in Catalan, it rains in bottles and barrels - 'plou a bots i barrals' - old words for large receptacles signifying a large amount of rain.

In Dutch, when there's an actual downpour, some say 'het houdt op met zachtjes regenen...' - 'it has stopped raining softly...' . The phrase was introduced by an Amsterdam writer, Simon Carmiggelt, famous for his irony. In Scotland, 'stoating' rain is so heavy, it bounces off the ground.

Both French and Dutch have more descriptive phrases for real downpours: 'il pleut des cordes' (it is raining ropes) and 'het regent pijpenstelen' (it's raining pipe stems - literally the stem of a pipe that one smokes) - both describing the long shape of the raindrops during heavy rain.

Animals play a role in our language around weather, but sometimes in different ways.

In French, when it is cold, it is ‘un froid de canard’ - a duck’s cold. In English, wet weather is ‘good weather for ducks’.

In English, the hot height of summer is known as the dog days of summer'. That term is a loan translation from Latin 'dies caniculares' ('puppy days), which was a translated loan word from ancient Greek. In Finnish, ‘koiranilma’ is dog weather, when the weather is really bad - cold, windy, rainy. In French, those same weather conditions give us ‘un temps de chien’ - a dog’s weather. Both may originate from the times when dogs lived mostly outside our homes.

When the weather starts to improve, across Europe we start to spy swallows in the sky - though we shouldn't take just one swallow as a sign of a change in weather. In Polish, 'jedna jaskółka wiosny nie czyni' and in French, ‘une hirondelle ne fait pas le printemps’, one swallow does not make spring.

But in English and Dutch, 'één zwaluw maakt nog geen zomer' one swallow does not make the summer - it seems the swallows come later for some of us.

Archaeological highlights from The Hunt Museum's collections of antiquities, fine and decorative art.

Europeana displays the digitised collections of museums, galleries, libraries and archives from all across Europe - north, south, east and west. One of the most westerly museums featured isThe Hunt Museumin Limerick in the south west of Ireland.

The Hunt Museum opened in 1997 to display John and Gertrude Hunt’s collections of antiquities, fine and decorative art. The Hunts wished the collection to remain together and be accessible to the people of Ireland, to inspire an interest in cultural heritage.

Housed in Limerick’s Palladian Custom House, the museum features more than 2000 art, cultural and archeological objects spanning in age from the Neolithic to the 21st century. Let's explore some highlights.

Stone tools known as lithics form one group of objects - from tiny flint scrapers to polished stone axeheads. Many came from the landscape near the Hunt family home, at Lough Gur near Limerick City.

This polished porcellanite axehead highlights pre-historic Irish trade networks. Porcellanite has two sources in Ireland, both in the north of the island - Tievebulliagh in Antrim and Brockley on Rathlin Island, off the north coast of Ireland. Both were used in prehistory to quarry stone for axehead production.

This small, beautiful bronze socketed and looped axehead from County Armagh was possibly used for woodworking or carpentry. The axe displays significant developments in metalworking, which occurred during the Bronze Age. This style heralded the final phase of the Irish Bronze Age, The Dowris Phase.

International objects in the Hunt Collection include an intricately constructed bronze, spectacle brooch and a Roman gilt bronze brooch.

This spectacle fibula comprises a brooch made from a length of round wire gently worked and folded into two tightly wound coils separated by a tiny twisted figure of eight, in what is known as early Hallstatt style.

This Roman crossbow fibula represents the end of the chronology of Roman brooches. Such objects, while seemingly decorative, function also in representing social status and wealth of the wearer.

This Greek vase is in the shape of a hand clasping alekythion, a miniature oil jar (HCM 233). It is shaped differently to other Greek vases in the Hunt Collection. Despite its uniqueness, it belongs to a group of Greek vessels known as 'plastic vases' but made from clay and painted. Here the hand is painted white possibly indicating that it is female.

Explore vintage photographs of the Spanish island, Ibiza from the early 20th century

The Spanish island Ibiza is well known to tourists these days for its nightlife: exciting bars, daring nightclubs and soulful dance music.

Beyond the dance beats and beaches, history and heritage dating back hundreds and thousands of years is waiting to be discovered.

This blogs looks at vintage photography and artworks depicting Ibiza before tourism, exploring the Mediterranean island's past.

These photographs were taken by German Hans Praesent during a trip in 1909.

This view of the city and port of Ibiza was taken from the bastion.

This lighthouse was located in front of Ibiza city.

Ibiza is known as the White Island, now used as a tourist slogan, inspired by the island's white architecture.

Such buildings can be seen in these vintage photographs, which date from around the early 20th century, and are part of the collections of the Ajuntament de Girona.

Passeig de Vara de Rey is the widest promenade in the city, and dates from the late 19th century.

These houses are described as being typical houses in Ibiza at the time of the photographs being taken.

A woman walks among the buildings.

Estonian artist and drawing teacher Juhan Nõmmik produced these artworks depicting Ibiza architecture and landscapes in the 1960s.

Nommik depicts the white houses of Ibiza with a low horizon.

The artworks give a sense of Ibiza far from the tourist crowds.

Nõmmik's artworks are now part of the collections of the Tartu Art Museum.

This pair of lithographs feature the coast of Ibiza, and date from after 1896.

This artwork features the island's southeast coast.

This artwork features the north coast of Ibiza.

Whether short or long distance, running has multiple incentives and rewards

Since prehistoric times, humans have been running. In those days, while hunting animals, the main reward was catching the hunted prey.

Nowadays, however, when the main motivation is no longer subsistence, people have continued to race, with athletics coming to be considered the oldest organised sport in the world.

Running has multiple incentives and rewards, both physical and psychological. On the psychological side, we can find incentives such as beating a new personal best, enjoying a beautiful landscape, breathing fresh air in nature, winning a competition or simply finishing a race. As for the physical aspect, there are lots of health goals that can go from losing weight to lowering blood sugar levels.

Regardless of what each person's main incentive is, running will reward you with a sense of well-being and better sleep after reviving the body.

Long distance running race types are 5,000 metres, 10,000 metres and the marathon. The middle distance races recognised by the World Athletics are 800 metres and 1,500 metres.

In the first editions of the modern Olympics, Paavo Nurmi (1897- 1973) - known as the ‘Flying Finn’ - stood out. Nurmi was a specialist in medium and long distance runs. His childhood was spent in a small cabin in the woods, where he was forced to follow a diet based on vegetables and dried fish, which, together with the cold Finnish winters, was key to developing his great resistance.

Although he won many Olympic races, his prominent triumphs were in Antwerp 1920 (10,000 m), Paris 1924 (5,000m) and Amsterdam 1928 (10,000 m). Nurmi introduced the regular stride technique, setting the pace on the stopwatch and distributing his energy evenly throughout the races.

Another prominent athlete, Emil Zátopek, was nicknamed the ‘Czech Locomotive’. With 5 Olympic golds and 18 world records, he was a world star in the early 1950s. In the 10,000 metres, over the course of six years, he dominated and revolutionised his sport. His three golds in long distance running at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics (including his victorious marathon debut) is a feat that will unlikely be repeated in history.

In contrast to the privileged athletes who had previously dominated the Olympic competition, Zatopek grew up in poverty. His training system, developed by himself, consisted of a large volume of interval training. Although he was derided at first, his success transformed the training methods of long-distance athletes.

In athletics, the opposite of endurance races are speed sprints: 100, 200 and 400 metres, as well as hurdle races: 110 and 400 metres. The emotion generated in a few seconds attracts many fans to races.

In Europe, there have been great athletes who dominated these speed tests. Two stand out especially: the Italian Pietro Mennea, famous for his legendary world record of 200 metres which stood for 17 years, and the Ukrainian Valery Borzov, who dominated speed races during the early 1970s. Both were Olympic champions.

Since antiquity, women in sports events have been discriminated against and marginalised. At the ancient Olympics, women were prohibited from taking part - although there was a female-only version of the Olympic games called the Hereos Games (in honour of the goddess Hera).

It was not until 1928, at the Olympics held in Amsterdam, that women first took part in athletics competitions, with very few participants compared to men. Equality with men has not truly come to the Olympics yet - in the 2012 London Olympics, women were 45% of the participants.

European female athletes have stood out brilliantly on the world athletics scene, including the German sprinter Marita Koch, the Russian middle distance runner Svetlana Masterkova and the Portuguese marathon runner Rosa Mota, to name just a few.

Cross country (also called simply cross) is a form of athletics that consists of traveling distances in non-urban natural circuits, mountains, forests, etc.

At the beginning of the 20th century, it was within the Olympic program. It has become a very popular race, particularly at amateur levels.

Also, in recent times there has been a boom in popular, public races. In the 1970s, big cities began to organise large popular marathons where anybody could take part. Berlin’s marathon is one of the most prestigious. Its first edition was held in 1973 and, on average, around 40,000 runners take part.

Other well-known popular races are San Silvestres, which are run on December 31 in various parts of the world. It is worth noting that popular races are frequently used to promote solidarity or some commercial objectives.

The triathlon consists of three disciplines in a row in the same event: swimming, cycling and running. Specific distances and features may vary by tournament. The Ironman is a long distance triathlon that ends with a marathon race. It is a very hard test - just finishing it is already quite a challenge.

Within the Ironman, we highlight an exceptional case outside the professional elite of athletics.

Ramón Arroyo is a Spanish citizen who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2004 at the age of 32. After a few depressing years, he decided to cope with the disease through physical exercise, and managed to finish an Ironman in Barcelona in 2013. He has written an autobiography titled 'Surrendering is not an option' and, in 2016, his life was brought to the big screen with the movie '100 meters'.

Talented opera singer who enjoyed worldwide fame in the 19th century

In the 2017 Hollywood filmThe Greatest Showman, there is a show-stopping moment when the main character P T Barnum watches a musical performance by Swedish singer Jenny Lind.

While the film's story takes dramatic license with the story of Barnum's circus, the real Jenny Lind was a hugely talented Swedish opera singer who took the USA by storm in the 1850s.

Born in Stockholm on 6 October 1820, Lind's talent was discovered when she was over-heard singing by the maid of Mademoiselle Lundberg, the principal dancer at the Royal Swedish Opera. The maid retuned the next day with Lundberg who arranged for Lind to have an audition for the Royal Dramatic Theatre.

Aged 10, Jenny Lind started to play in more than 30 spoken roles, with her first starring role coming when she was aged just 17 - playing Agathe in Weber's Der Freischütz. By 20, she was a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music and court singer to the King of Sweden and Norway.

Throughout her teenage years and early 20s, Lind's voice became damaged, but studying with music teacher Manuel Garcia in Paris, she learned healthier and safer vocal techniques.

Through the 1840s, Lind toured extensively, performing in cities and countries across Europe - Denmark, Berlin, Vienna, London - becoming an international star with the nickname 'the Swedish Nightingale'.

In 1849, PT Barnum approached her with an offer to tour the USA.

Realising it could benefit her favourite charities in Sweden, Lind agreed. Barnum was a master of publicity, promoting her tour well before she arrived in New York. The tour was a huge success, with Lind performing 93 concerts for Barnum. After a year, she began to tire of Barnum's relentless publicity and parted ways with him, but continued touring under her own management for almost another year.

This is the tour depicted inThe Greatest Showman, but there's no historical evidence of a romance between Barnum and Lind (as implied in the film).

Near the end of the tour, in February 1852, Lind married her pianist and conductor Otto Goldschmidt. They returned to Europe, living first in Germany and, from 1858, in England. Between 1853 and 1861, the couple had three children.

From then on, she performed in concert halls rather than grand opera houses. In 1882, she was appointed professor of singing at the newly founded Royal College of Music.

In 1887, Lind died aged 67. The technology of the time means that, despite her long and successful career, no recordings of her voice were made or remain today.

Her talent and fame are remembered today in the name 'The Swedish Nightingale' and commemorated in music and films, placenames and statues and even toys, banknotes and ship figureheads.

Trude Pritzi

Richard Bergmann

Teenage table tennis world champions from Vienna

A table tennis hall in the heart of Vienna’s 8th district is probably the world’s oldest. The hall, at Lange Gasse 69, dates back to the 19th century - when men played table tennis in tail-coats.

With more than a hundred years of history, it was where several Austrian world champions trained and played.

This was where one of the most-known world champions, Trude Pritzi, learnt and revolutionised table tennis. In her career, Trude won 14 world championship medals - five golds, two silvers and six bronzes.

Aged 17, Trude Pritzi made it to the finals of the 1937 World Table Tennis Championship in Baden, Germany.

Her match against the reigning champion Ruth Aarons from the United States was defensive. Pritzi and Aarons played for 100 minutes with their extensive and exhaustive rallies forcing the jury to abandon the game and vacate the championship.

This was the first and only time such a decision was taken in competitive table tennis. The judges wished that table tennis be seen as an active and energetic sport, rather than merely defensive.

In March 1938, a few weeks before the Anschluss when Nazi Germany annexed Austria, Pritzi won her ‘first’ World Championship Gold Medal in Wembley, London - without losing a single set.

After the Anschluss, at the 1939 World Championships in Cairo, Egypt, Pritzi played for the team of Nazi Germany. There, she won four World Championship medals including silver in the singles and gold in the doubles.

After World War II, Pritzi resumed playing for Austria - winning a bronze and gold medal in the singles and doubles competitions at the 1947 championships in Paris. Her last world championship medal came in 1953 - a bronze medal as a member of the Austrian team.

In 2001, 33 years after Pritzi’s death, Pritzi and Aarons were posthumously named ‘co-champions’ of the 1937 championship by the International Table Tennis Federation.

In the days before World War II, Pritzi spoke of feeling like a professional sportswoman and continuing to play. After the war, Pritzi mentioned in interviews that she ‘was completely exhausted that many of her colleagues had to flee’.

Richard Bergmann was one of those who had to flee.

He had played in the same table tennis hall where Pritzi played and won an individual gold medal in the 1937 World Championships as well as a silver in the doubles competition. At 17, Bergmann was the youngest person to win a single world champion title - an accomplishment he still holds.

In 1938, following the Anschluss, Jewish Bergmann, like many other outstanding Jewish table tennis players, fled Vienna and went to London. Competing from then onwards for England, he won 16 medals over the remainder of his career - including two golds in the singles and doubles competitions at the 1939 World Championships.

Both Richard Bergmann and Trude Pritzi were just 17 years old when they won their first World Champion titles, with both beginning their careers at that same Viennese table tennis centre - a centre which continues to this day.

Champion of the world in the 1930s

German boxer Max Schmeling was one of the first Europeans to be world heavyweight boxing champion of the world, winning first in 1930. Through the 1930s, his successful boxing career ran parallel to the rise of Nazi Germany, with political overtones to his athletic achievements.

Born in September 1905, Max Schmeling was the son of a Hamburg sailor. He began boxing in amateur competitions. By 1924, he had won Germany's national amateur title in the light heavyweight division.

Embarking on a professional boxing career, Schmeling won and retained multiple German championships. In 1927, Schmeling won the European championship against Belgian boxer Fernand Delarge.

The following year, he retained his European and German championship titles and decided to compete for bigger matches and prizes in the United States.

By 1930, Schmeling had won the world heavyweight championship. His victory wasn't convincing, as he was the first boxer to win the title by disqualification, after his opponent Jack Sharkey, an American boxer of Lithuanian heritage, knocked him down with a low blow in the fourth round.

Nonetheless, Schmeling was the world heavyweight champion between 1930 and 1932. He lost the title to Sharkey in 1932, who won by a controversial decision.

In 1933, German Schmeling's match with American boxer of Jewish heritage Max Baer set the tone for the next decade of his boxing career. Schmeling became associated with the Nazi party's rise in Germany, with many seeing Schmeling as a puppet of Nazi Germany.

His matches against black American boxer Joe Louis in the late 1930s went far beyond sport, becoming stages where international politics and race relations were played out.

In June 1936, Schmeling knocked out Louis in the 12th round of their match. The Nazi Party attempted to capitalise on Schmeling’s victory for propaganda, promoting Schmeling as a representative of their ideologies. Films showed the match, Hitler reacting to the match, and Schmeling was hailed as a hero on his return to Germany.

However, despite meeting Hitler and Goebbels on multiple occasions and how he was viewed in the United States, Schmeling never became a member of the Nazi party and vowed to remain apolitical. He continued his professional relationship with his Jewish-American manager, Joe Jacobs, and even sheltered two Jewish boys (the young sons of his friend David Lewin) in his apartment in Berlin during the Kristallnacht in November 1938.

In 1938, Schmeling again faced Louis in an eagerly-anticipated match in New York.

Louis knocked out Schmeling two minutes into the first round. When it became clear that Schmeling would lose, the radio broadcast of the fight in Germany ended. Schmeling was taken to hospital, with two broken vertebrae. His return to Germany had none of the ceremony that had greeted him in 1936.

During World War II, Schmeling served with the Luftwaffe as a paratrooper. In May 1941, he was injured parachuting during the invasion of Crete in 1941.

After the war, Schmeling returned to boxing in 1947–48, winning three of five fights in Germany before retiring permanently in 1948, aged 43.

Schmeling later worked for Coca-Cola, which made him a wealthy man and he became known as a generous philanthropist. In the 1970s, he published his autobiography. Schmeling died in 2005 aged 99, the longest living heavyweight boxing champion in history.

The origins of the shipping company Cunard Line

The name Cunard is now known for sailing, with large liners crossing seas and oceans around the world.

Its origins stem to shipping magnate Samuel Cunard, who was born in 1787 in Halifax, Canada.

Emigration was part of Samuel Cunard's family. His mother's family were originally Irish and, on his father's side, he was descended from German Quaker emigrants to the United States.

Cunard later mirrored their journey by moving from Canada to London, and through his companies, contributed to making transatlantic travel more comfortable for future generations.

Cunard's father was a master carpenter. He joined his father in the family business, having already started in business in his teenage years. This enterpreneurial spirit led to Cunard expanding the family's enterprise into shipping.

From the 1830s onwards, the company moved into steam shipping, having managed a mail service for post along the east coast of North America. Increasingly, the company moved into Transatlantic travel, with regular passenger and freight services.

In 1838, when he was travelling to London, he discovered an advert calling for the management of the postal transport between the United Kingdom, Halifax and New York. The company he set up with several other businessmen won the right to run this mail service.

The Cunard company made ocean liners a success, with a good reputation for speed and safety - winning awards for fastest Atlantic voyages across several decades.

During the 1840s, Cunard moved from Canada to London permanently, where he lived until his death in 1865. The Cunard line went on to become a leading shipping company worldwide.

Sign languages are ways of visual communication using hand gestures and other types of body language. There are over 200 different sign languages and dialects in the world.

They are often less connected to spoken languages than one might think and have complex and rich histories, linguistics and grammar.

Every year on 23 September, theInternational Day of Sign Languagesis celebrated. This marks the day in 1951 when the World Federation of the Deaf was founded. It is a significant day inDeaf culture. The International Day of Sign Languages was first celebrated in 2018, as part of the International Week of the Deaf, which has been marked since 2009.

Even though these international organisations and events are quite recent, sign languages have existed for centuries. They sprang up out of necessity so deaf and hard of hearing people could communicate.

Most of the knowledge we have on historical sign languages is limited to manual alphabets, which were a way of translating between spoken languages and visual language. Some of the oldest preserved manual alphabets date from the 17th century.

A lot of remnants of these manual alphabets can still be found in modern sign languages. The vowels in British Sign Language, for instance, are still made by pointing at the tips of your fingers on the left hand.

Even though sign languages were largely developed organically by the users of those languages, throughout history some individuals have been instrumental in formalising and disseminating those languages.

The Spanish Benedictine MonkPedro Ponce de Léondeveloped a manual alphabet as early as the 16th Century.

The French abbotCharles-Michel de l'Épéepublished his version of the manual alphabet in the 18th Century, which has stayed largely unchanged in the current French and American Sign Languages. de l'Épée founded the first school for deaf children in Paris. One of the graduates of this first school went on to found the first school for the deaf in the United States.

Because graduates of the French school for the deaf imported their sign language to the United States, there still are a lot of similarities betweenASL(American Sign Language) andLSF(French Sign Language).

Since most sign languages develop and spread largely independently from spoken languages, there are a lot of differences between the geographical influences, geographical spread, grammar and linguistic traits of sign languages compared to spoken languages.

One of the biggest influences in the development and spread of a certain sign language is the founding of schools for the deaf.

An example of this is the influence ofCarl Oscar MalmandFritz HirnonFinnish Sign Language.

Finnish Sign Language developed fromSwedish Sign Languagethrough Carl Oscar Malm. Carl had studied at the Stockholm School of the Deaf, where Swedish Sign Language was taught. He took this sign language back with him to Finland, where he founded the first Finnish school for the Deaf in Porvoo in 1846. He later founded a second, state-sponsored school in Turku.

Fritz Hirn was a private student of Malm's, and later thought at the school for the Deaf in Turku.

The home of Fritz and his wife Maria Hirn quickly became a popular spot for the deaf community of Turku to gather. Out of these lively weekly Sunday gatherings, the first Finnish Association of the Deaf was born, mirroring the Swedish Association of the Deaf.

Fritz would go on to start formalising the Finnish Sign Language and found the first deaf kindergarten in Helsinki.

The Deaf community is richly varied, with dozens of different schools throughout Europe reaching different languages and dialects, but all united in serving Deaf and Hard of Hearing people.

The International Day of Sign Languages in 2020 has the slogan 'Sign Languages are for Everyone!' and the theme of the International Week of Deaf people is 'Reaffirming Deaf people's Rights'. Learn more about these celebrations on theWorld Federation of the Deaf's website, and support Deaf people's rights bysigning the WFD Charter.

Some of the images used in this blog use the word 'dumb' or 'mute' to refer to people from the Deaf community. Even though these words are used in their historical context, these terms are derogatory today and shouldn't be used to refer to members of the Deaf community.

The phrase Bulgarian, heroes! accompanies every sporting event that Bulgaria takes part in, and is well known to every proud Bulgarian.

The phraseBulgarian, heroes!accompanies every sporting event that Bulgaria takes part in, and is well known to every proud Bulgarian.



However, few know that this exclamation stems from the culture of 'Hero' gymnastic societies - youth organisations imbued with Bulgarian national ideals that played an important role in the patriotic upbringing of several generations of young Bulgarians.

The first 'Hero' gymnastic society was founded in Sofia on August 25, 1895 by Todor Yonchev. Swiss gymnastics coaches Louis Ayer, Daniel Blanchou, Alois Bunter and Sh. Shampo were invited to contribute to it by the Minister of Education Georgy Zhivkov.

Over the following three years, more than 20 organisatons were established. Members came from all parts of society - students and young people, intelligentsia and peasants. However, in the early years, women were not allowed.

The Union of Bulgarian Gymnastic Societies 'Hero' was established at the First Congress of Societies in 1898, the beginning of the sports movement in Bulgaria. This public organisation deals with the patriotic upbringing of young people with the motto: 'Hard and strong – altogether for the Motherland'.

Gymnastics were the main focus for this youth training, but it is fundamentally different from today's understanding of the sport. It was a complete system of exercises and activities through which, moral and ethical qualities - in addition to physical training - are cultivated for the benefit of the society.

Games and competitions were organised in the most advanced disciplines: athletics, wrestling and weight-lifting. There were also more theatrical performances, including gymnastic demonstrations, poetry, dances and talks.

Youth companies gradually set up the first halls and playgrounds, in Sofia, Varna, Burgas, Plovdiv, Stara Zagora and Ruse.

Spectacular national competitions were organised. By 1937, eight Youth Union Councils had been held.

The first was hosted by Varna Gymnastics Society ‘Black Sea Youth’ in 1900. There were 11 companies and 77 Youth Student Units, with about 800 participants and 560 players.

The Varna municipality, headed by the mayor Costa Rankov, built a stadium in the Sea Garden. Guest groups from Sofia and Ruse marched to the Sea Garden to start the gymnastics competition, followed by Varna's 'heroes'. A special hymn for the event was written by the Bulgarian composer Dobri Hristov.

The beginning of autumn is the time of the Jewish New Year

Happy New Year from Europeana! What…  you didn’t realize it was already the New Year? When most people think of September, thoughts of crisp autumn days and children returning to school come to mind. However, for Jews around the world, the beginning of autumn is also the time of theJewish New Year(or Rosh Hashanna in Hebrew), which typically occurs in September or early October.

Jews celebrate the new year in many ways, both at home and in thesynagogue, where a special prayer service of thanksgiving is held. Theshofar, a biblical instrument made from an animal horn (usually of a ram), is blown during the services to announce the coming of the new year and is meant to represent a spiritual awakening. Giving charity to people in need and buying new clothing is also often part of how Jews observe the holiday.

In the home, the Jewish New Year is a time for families to come together for a festive meal. Special foods are eaten to symbolize the hope for a “sweet new year”, including fruits from the autumn harvest. One specific tradition is to dip apples in honey.

Another popular activity is sending greeting cards to family and friends, particularly those who one will not see during the holiday. Handwritten Jewish New Year cards originated in Germany in the 1400s. In the 20th century, their popularity took off at the same time as Christmas, Easter, and Valentine’s day cards due to inexpensive colour printing and cheap postal rates. The selection of Jewish New Year’s cards below is indicative of the diversity of Jewish life throughout the 20th century, shifting artistic influences, linguistic diversity and the political events which marked the Jewish community in the modern era.

The most popular early Jewish New Year cards were printed and designed byHaim Goldbergin Warsaw between 1920-40. His cards depict different aspects of Jewish life in Eastern Europe, sometimes of a religious nature and other times humorous scenes accompanied by poems in Yiddish.

The two cards below touch upon the centrality ofZionismand the creation of the modernState of Israelwithin the 20thcentury Jewish experience.  The card from the early 20th century on the left shows a man and woman holding Zionist flags, whereas the card from the 1970s was made to promote Israel’s national airlineELAL.

The card below was printed in Germany, yet surprisingly does not contain any German. Instead, there is a mixture of English, Hebrew and Yiddish. Perhaps it was sent to family members who had emigrated to the United States?

The rare hand-drawn card below was made in the final year of World War II. The imagery is striking, in that it doesn’t include any traditional holiday themes or Hebrew. Instead, it focuses on the hope for liberation with patriotic Dutch motifs, although the wording is in English and French.

More recently, Jewish artists have been inspired to design stylized holiday-specific cards. Below is a modern and whimsical take on a New Year’s card by Dutch artist Eli Content: a block print in Hebrew with a fish on a Chinese newspaper. Perhaps it could also be used for Chinese New Year?

Throughout the 20th century, Jewish communities began to open up toward outsiders, as seen in the picture below of the Dutch royal family visiting the Spanish-Portuguese synagogue of Amsterdam in September 1904.

With recent technological advances, the Jewish community has also been able to open itself up virtually to non-Jews interested in learning about Judaism. These videos about Jewish New Year  are a good example; one was made for the French television show“La Source de Vie”in 1990, while the other aired onSlovenian national televisionin 1998. Both explain the holiday and show Jewish communities celebrating the new year.

Wishing everyone the traditional greeting of “L’Shana Tova,” which is Hebrew for “a Good Year.”

For centuries, people have been visiting a simple wooden home where Peter the Great stayed.

Long before the Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh museum and many other sights, one of the earliest tourist attractions in the Netherlands was a simple wooden house with an interesting royal history.

The Czar Peter House is the oldest preserved wooden building in the Zaan region of the Netherlands, a few kilometers outside Amsterdam.

In 1697, the house was a temporary home to Czar Peter the Great who stayed there for eight days to study shipbuilding.

Grand Duke Pyotr Alexeyevich Romanov had began his reign in 1682, and set about implementing reforms to modernise Russia. He introduced French and western dress to his court, re-organised the Russian army along modern lines and hoped to make Russia an industrial and maritime power.

Thus, 15 years into his reign, he travelled to Zaandam to study shipbuiliding as an ordinary ship's carpenter under the pseudoym Peter Michaeloff.

Built in 1632, the building was the home of blacksmith and craftsman Gerrit Kist whom Peter had met in Moscow. It was far from palatial, with Peter staying just for eight days. Later, Peter went to Amsterdam and on to London, returning to Moscow in 1698.

Peter's short stay made the humble cottage famous. He returned to visit again a number of times - his last visit was in 1717.

Having become famous, the house became a tourist attraction. Its visitors book contains thousands of names, including Emperor NapoleonBonaparte in 1811. Many Dutch and international monarchs have visited this simple house.

In 1818, in honour of the birth of his grandson, King Willem I bought the hosue as a gift for his Russian daughter-in-law Anna Pavlovna. Five years later, she paid for a stone arch to protect the wooden house. This has since been replaced several times by other structures.

Today, the house in Zaandam is part of the Zaans Museum and can be visited each day.

The Wachau as a summer resort

Conserving the Wachau

Extending 36 kilometres along the Danube, the Wachau is a landscape of stunning scenery

The cultural landscape of the Wachau region of Austria offers thousands of years of history, with the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage seal of approval.

Extending over 36 kilometres along the Danube between the towns of Melk and Krems, the Wachau is a landscape of stunning scenery.

Striking rugged cliffs, winding valleys, defence towers that have been built since Roman times through the early Middle Ages, medieval castles and fortresses, impressive baroque Benedictine monasteries and fields and orchards all combine to characterise the Wachau landscape.

For thousands of years, people have lived in the Wachau, attracted by its mild climate.

The name Wachau can be found in a document of Emperor Otto I from the year 972 - spelled as Vuachoua.

However, evidence of human settlement can be traced to the Stone Age. The two oldest archaeological finds in Austria - the Venus of Willendorf, which is around 30,000 years old, and the Venus of Galgenberg - were both discovered during excavations in the Wachau.

The area of the Wachau covers about 20,000 hectares, of which about 10% is used for wine-growing, which is essential for the region. Cultivation of fruit and wine has been an economic activity for centuries.

The Romans first brought the knowledge of this craft - with techniques such as grafting and cultivation and the ability to work vines to the area.

The Commemoratorium of St. Severin - an important source of Roman and early medieval everyday life - was completed in 511 A.D. It reports on vine cultivation and wine-growing in the Wachau, telling of weekly markets by the Rugier, an East Germanic people who settled in the area. During this time, the Romans lived in fortified settlements, which were extended and rebuilt from former castles in order to find protection from invading Germanic groups. In front of their walls, St. Severin describes cattle pastures, fields, orchards and vineyards.

Later, the large Bavarian monasteries built vineyards in many Wachau villages.

The wine-growing techniques handed down by the Romans have developed over the centuries, favoured by the mild climate, the special soil with its characteristic wine terraces on the slopes, which are very low at an altitude of around 200 metres and are well situated for sustainable cultivation and maintenance. This type of traditional cultivation and wine pressing techniques can also be considered part of the region’s intangible cultural heritage.

Even today, the names of some of the winegrowers' houses remind us of their historical origins: the work of the diocese of Freising is remembered in Freisingerhof, Carthusians and monastery farms also describe their original affiliation. Today, more than 200 vineyards cover an area of 1,344 hectares.

The most famous grape varieties are the Grüner Veltliner and the Riesling. The region also produces other fruits such as apricot and apple  - all of which develop their special taste in the Wachau region.

The Wachau has been a popular destination for guests looking for summer freshness for over 100 years.

It offers mild climates, good wine, fresh fruit, and many possibilities to explore its historically interesting places. The region can be explored by cycling, ferries or hiking trails.

From Weißenkirchen to St. Lorenz, one transport option is a unique experience: a ferry is pulled by a wire rope over the Danube to the bank. The force of the current can be experienced and in a few minutes you can reach the other side of the bank.

Arriving at the St. Lorenz ferry station, passengers are greeted by an excessively large nose sticking out of the ground. This nose - an art installation by the Gelatin Group - provides a multitude of interpretations and inspirations to the senses.

Noses are important to the region - needed to determine the bouquet of wine. The large nose is supposedly modelled on the son of the mayor of Rossatz . Its presence encourages visitors to concentrate on the different scents of the respective seasons. Thanks to its size, the nose is even accessible and can be explored from the inside.

The Wachau had been declared a landscape conservation area as early as 1955.

In the year 2000, the Wachau region in Austria was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List in the category ‘Cultural Landscape’ - one of 10 regions in Austria that are now part of UNESCO World Heritage List, a distinction shared with 1121 other sites in 167 countries around the world.

In addition to the Wachau cultural landscape, the Benedictine monasteries of Melk and Göttweig as well as the old town of Krems have also been included in the list as World Cultural Heritage sites.

By its inclusion, Austria undertakes to preserve and protect the region’s sites and monuments in accordance with the World Heritage Convention. Its special features and characteristics are to be preserved for future generations through national protection measures and appropriate care, administration and management.

The medieval archaeological heritage of eastern Andalusia boasts a range of highly valuable artistic, historical and touristic movable and immovable goods.

The medieval archaeological heritage of eastern Andalusia boasts a range of highly valuable artistic, historical and touristic movable and immovable goods in the upper Guadalquivir Valley and in the province of Jaén, Spain. This area showcases ten centuries of the history of the Iberian peninsula, from the 4th century to the 15th century, furnished with archaeological and architectural evidence of the late Roman and Visigothic period (4th to 8th century), of the Islamic period (8th to 15th century) and of the Christian period (11th to 15th century).

The late Roman and the Visigothic period

The late Roman period (4th century) witnessed the onset of transformations that became complete during the Visigothic phase. In eastern Andalusia, this showed in the transformation of towns and their gradual abandonment during this period. The local elites moved to the countryside and became part of the church hierarchy more and more often.

Christianity permeated throughout, as evidenced by the sarcophagus of Martos, the glass paten  of Cástulo (Linares), the Christogram burning lamp of Jaén, the hermitage of Valdecanales (Rus) and the graves goods of the cemetery of Cerro Salido, in La Guardia.

The Islamic period

The conquest of the Iberian peninsula in 711 by the Muslim armies triggered a political, economic, social and religious transformation. A centralized state based on taxes and on the urban world appeared and grew as the local population adjusted to the Arab and Islamic culture. Material evidence of this process and of its transformations through the centuries span from signs of political power (castles, mosques, coins, etc.) through everyday life items (tableware, pottery toys, jewellery, etc.). Examples of these are the emirate treasure of Marroquíes Bajos (Jaén), the castle of Baños de la Encina, the diadem of Charilla (Alcálá la Real), the baths (hammam) of the palace of Villardompardo (Jaén) and the butcher shop of Martos.

The conquest of the Christian kingdoms

This period incorporated both coexistence and open conflict for the conquest of al-Andalus. Castille’s military campaign intensified from the 13th century onwards: castles, walls and watching towers stand out as the most typical items of this period. Both sides built new fortresses and strengthened existing ones. As the conquest made progress, towns came into the Christian model by way, among others, of new churches, public buildings, squares and palaces with more and more remarkable fronts. Major examples of these are the Torre del Concejo (Jaén), the castle of Lopera, the castle of El Berrueco (Torredelcampo), the palace of (Baeza) or the churches of Santa Cruz (Baeza) and San Bartolomé (Jaén).

How did the Circulating Schools operate?

What were the Circulating Schools’ purpose?

Read about a Welsh minister and his circulating schools - best known for spreading literacy

Between 1731 and 1771,Griffith Jones's Circulating Schools managed to teach half of Wales to read. In the space of forty years, around 200,000 people had attended his three-month schooling programmes, including men, women and children. This was quite a feat as they were not government funded.

Jones’s endeavour radically transformed Wales in a spiritual and cultural sense.

The renowned preacher did not wish to create educated social climbers, but communities of pure Christians. In his view, the inability to read the Scriptures in an individual’s mother-tongue endangered one’s access to the eternal life.

Therefore, most classes under Jones’s system were held through the medium of Welsh. These short-term schools not only had a profound effect on literacy in Wales, but they varied the way people experienced the Welsh language. It was now practised more widely in textual and written form, as well as orally.

Across Europe, Jones’s schools were the subject of many a discussion.Catherine the Great, Empress of Russia, even commissioned a report on his charitable endeavour in 1764.

The schools circulated all over Wales and typically lasted three months at each location. Sessions were held at central community hubs: churches, chapels and sometimes farm barns.

Recruited teachers were often trained beforehand by Griffith Jones himself, at his base inLlanddowror, Carmarthenshire.

This charitable endeavour attracted financial support from far and wide. Patrons as far as London and Somerset donated towards Jones’s Circulating Schools.The Society for Promoting Christian Knowledgesupplied him with generous amounts of religious texts, especially Welsh Bibles, to be used as teaching material in the 'classroom'.

It’s worth noting that around two thirds of each classroom were adults.

Between 1710 and 1731 Griffith Jones worked avidly as a clergyman and preacher. He was fond of questioning his congregation on their morals and beliefs.

However, he quickly realised that a large portion of his rural congregation at Llanddowror were incapable of discussing such matters sophisticatedly. Quite simply, because they didn’t have access to an education. As a result, these folk were unable to develop their ability to read widely on religious subjects.

This inspired Jones to set-up his Circulating Schools. It’s no surprise that they placed great emphasis on reading and understanding the Bible, which, in Jones’s view, could save one’s soul.

By Griffith Jones’s death in 1761, a total of 3,495 Circulating Schools had been conducted all over Wales. These schools continued to circulate until 1771.

Polish Jewish migrant Tuschinski established several cinemas in the Netherlands

In the centre of Amsterdam, a beautiful cinema tells a story of Jewish life in the Netherlands in the early 20th century.

The Tuschinski Theatre - now known as Pathé Tuschinski - is now the only remaining venue of the entertainment empire of Abraham Icek Tuschinski who previously had venues in both Amsterdam and Rotterdam.

The Tuschinski was opened in 1921. Its interior and exterior are a mix of architectural styles - most often described as part Art Nouveau and part Art Deco.

Abraham Tuschinski was born near Lodz in Poland in 1886. Aged 18, he decided to emigrate to the United States with his wife Mariem Ehrlich. They followed a route taken by many at that time, travelling over land to the Netherlands, intending to cross the ocean on a ship departing from Rotterdam.

However, on their stop-over in Rotterdam, the couple decided to stay in the busy port-city. Abraham became a tailor, and later they both ran a boarding house mostly for Eastern European Jews, Hotel Polski.

Within a decade of settling in Rotterdam, Abraham had opened his first cinema in the city.

He converted a disused seaman's church to the Thalia cinema, which was open for 18 months until it was due to be demolished to make room for construction work.

Tuschinski moved this cinema to another location in the city, and within 13 years, he had built four cinemas in Rotterdam - the Cinema Royal, Scala and Olympia joining the Thalia.

In 1918, along with his brothers-in-law Tuschinski bought land in Amsterdam on which the Tuschinski Theatre was built. The cinema was palatial, with opulent interiors and stylish settings. Attending the cinema became a full evening's entertainment, and could be accompanied by a visit to the adjacent nightclub, La Gaité.

Following his flagship cinema in Amsterdam, Tuschinski opened another luxury cinema - the Grand Theater - in Rotterdam and another cinema in Amsterdam, the Roxy Theatre, as well as another in the town of Schiedam.

World War II in the Netherlands destroyed Jewish life. During the war, the Amsterdam cinema's name was changed from that of its Jewish founder to the name 'Tivoli'.

Abraham Tuschinski and almost his entire family were murdered in the Nazi concentration camps. The city of Rotterdam was destroyed by Nazi German bombardment - none of Tuschinski's cinemas in Rotterdam survived.

However, the Tuschinski cinema in Amsterdam remains with the name of its founder restored. The cinema now hosts blockbuster and arthouse films, as well as special events such as film festivals.

The story behind a viral photograph of Swedish artist Einar Bager painting naked

Recently this cheeky image of a naked artist painting a nude model was shared by the Instagram accountmuseumbums.

This isn't the first time this image has been shared online - it could be called a viral sensation, as it has been shared thousands of times on Tumblr and gained hundreds of likes on Instagram.

These accounts often focus on the homosocial aspect of the photograph showing two men naked together, and the unique situation of seeing an artist naked while painting a nude model.

But what's the real story behind the photograph?

In all the thousands of shares, the photograph is captioned as being Einer Bagner, but in fact the pert painter is Swedish artist and historian, Einar Bager.

Einar was a prolific artist, illustrator and historian. There are more than 1,000 images (sketches, drawings, paintings) attributed to him in the collections of the Malmö Museums. He was born in Malmö in 1887, the son of a prominent businessman.

The photograph shows the date 1910. Born in 1887, Einar was then 23 years old. By this time, Einar had studied art in Copenhagen, finishing his studies in 1909.

The photographer was Harald Bager. Sometimes this is credited as having been photographed by his brother, but actually Harald Bagar was Einar's father.

In 1918, he married Clara Persson who was 25 at the time.

Later in life, Einar focused on history, publishing many volumes relating to Malmö's history including many illustrations, sketches and drawings.

Einar's artworks include many paintings of people, including nude sketches, landscape scenes from the Skåne region of Sweden, as well as capturing the historic architecture of Malmö and its city life.

The photograph's caption says that Einar is painting on rocks near Mölle.

During the 19th century, Mölle, a small Swedish village to the north of Helsingborg, had become known as a resort town.

Nowadays, we think very little of everyone going to a beach. But in some societies in the 19th century, the notion of men and women, boys and girls bathing together was somewhat shocking.

By the end of the 1800s, Mölle was one of the first seaside resorts in Sweden - and was known as a place where mixed sex bathing could happen. Visitors came from across Sweden and other parts of Europe - there was even a weekly train service from Berlin to Mölle.

For the most part, men and women bathed together wearing swimsuits.

In the early 20th century, there was a belief that sunbathing and swimming in the sea was healthy, and restorative. Some paintings of the time capture this - Norwegian artist Edvard Munch's 1907 painting Bathing Men being one example.

This gives some context to Einar and his model. Sadly, there does not seem to be a digitised version of the painting that Einar is working on. The closest we have found is this coastal scene - very beautiful and serene, but without the male model that made the original photograph unique.

Perspective panorama were popular in the 18th century, the forerunners of visual entertainment tools

During panademic quarantines, we could experience online virtual spaces opening up infinite opportunities and worlds. Switching on our devices - laptops, smart appliances, televisions - we could be in the exhibition rooms of museums in far-away countries virtually or walk on the squares of unknown cities with online maps.

For our generation, it is increasingly difficult to imagine that things have not always been like this - not even 20-30 years ago, and certainly not in the baroque age.

Curiosity and the desire to know the world are deeply rooted in people. In the middle of the 18th century, this thirst created a genre called 'Guckkastenbild'.

Perspective panorama pictures became popular owing to optic innovations of the 18th century, and became the forerunners of visual entertainment tools. Picture demonstrators took their 'peep' boxes to fairs from town to town, and showed remote landscapes, beautiful street views, panoramas, and artistic buildings of far-away cities or battlefields, disaster scenes in three dimensions realistically to common people for some pennies.

The graphical collection of thePiarist Museum in Budapestcontains about 60 pieces of coloured perspective engravings, panorama views that have a unique cultural, media and art historical importance. These pictures played the role of the internet or television in the 18th century, taking viewers to far away, unreachable lands and cities, imitating the illusion of reality.

The engravings in the collection were published by specialised workshops all over in Europe, such as the publishers John & Thomas Bowles and the Robert Laurie & John Whittle in London and the printing houses of Basset, Chereau, Daumont, Hucquier and Mondhare in Paris. Georg Balthasar Probst's (1732-1801) printing-house in Augsburg in the Holy Roman Empire was one of the most productive, with a workshop in Italy as well.

These engravings are called 'Prospect' or 'Perspective View' in English, 'Vue d'Optique' or 'Vue Perspective' in French and 'Guckkastenblatt' or 'Guckkastenbild' in German. The engravings were placed in a closed box or peep box under a special appliance equipped with a magnifying lens called zograscope, which had a strong spatial effect in viewers.

Placing and subtitling pictures were done similarly by most publishers. Usually, the title is under the picture in one or several languages, depending on the depicted country or city they were written in Latin, German, English, French, Italian or Dutch. Sometimes, a short, mirrored text can be found above the picture as well, which was an explanation to viewers, because the zograscope showed both the text and the engraving mirrored.

Thus, Perspective Views gave the 'right' image through the zograscope if they depicted the mirrored image of reality in their original conditions.

Regarding their themes, variety is extraordinary in the perspective engraving genre. Most of them are city views with streets, ports, palaces, castles surrounded with parks. However, you can often find exotic landscapes or disaster scenes too. Besides these, historic scenes and other special events like land or sea battles, sieges and processions were also fashionable and even the dates of the events were written on them.

Alongside these popular topics, the collection has a special gem: an uncoloured series of engravings consisting of large sheets of paper with the title 'Seven Wonders of the Ancient World'. Its exotic theme was extremely beloved in the period. It was a social entertainment in wealthy families to watch pictures, but owing to showmen, common people could also experience them. For one moment, remote landscapes could come to life in front of anyone.

When did these perspective panorama pictures get into the collection of the Piarist Museum? Regarding the dating of the collection, the bracketing cover of the coloured engravings help us. The handwritten Latin inscription on the cover 'No. V. Cupra diversa illuminata' (Different coloured engravings) was written by Fr. Alajos Hegedűs (1761-1843), the secretary of the Hungarian Piarist Province, who made the detailed catalogue of the archives of the Order Province in 1809, which was already kept in Pest. According to the catalogue, the coloured engravings were in the 'internal archives' together with other engravings, draft plans and maps.

Fr. Alajos Hegedűs used a student's handwritten salutation addressed to Fr. Piarist Province Leader Imre Perczel (1733-1795) as a cover that can be considered as a calligraphy exercise. These imply that the collection was already stored in an ordered, systematized form at the beginning of the 19th century; and the collection itself could be composed by the end of the 18th century. Archivist Fr. Rezső Jászai (1871-1952) reorganised the archives after 1920; he made a new catalogue of maps and draft plans, and the engravings might have been moved to the collection of the newly established Piarist Museum that time.

Little Venice, London

Wrocław, Poland

Birmingham, England

Aveiro, Portugal

Giethoorn, The Netherlands

Colmar, France

Ålesund, Norway

What other places across Europe have been named after Venice?

Venice's reputation for beauty is world renowned. Its ancient history, canals and architecture have been celebrated by travellers, artists and writers for centuries.

OutsideItaly, there are many towns and cities across Europe that also share Venice's reputation. These canal-crossed communities can be known as Little Venice, Venices of the North or Venices of the East.

Let's explore some of Europe's 'other Venices'.

A neighbourhood near Paddington station in the west ofLondon, centred around the junction of three canals, is known as Little Venice.

A small basin is formed by the Paddington Arm of the Grand Union Canal, the Regent's Canal and a short canal that connects to the Paddington Basin. Regency architecture, with white stucco facades, line the nearby streets, while many houseboats are permanently moored in the area.

The origins of its name are disputed - some attribute it to poet Robert Browning, some claim it was coined by Lord Byron.

Wrocław, the fourth largest city in Poland, is surrounded by rivers and canals.

The city is built on 12 islands on the Odra river with more than 100 bridges, giving it the nickname the 'Polish Venice'.

In 2016, Wrocław was the European Capital of Culture along with San Sebastián / Donostia.

Birmingham is the second-largest city in England, booming and expanding during the Industrial Revolution.

By the 1820s, the city had constructed an extensive canal system. In fact, Birmingham has more miles of canal than Venice, although in Birmingham, the canals are less prominent.

Aveiro is a coastal town to the south of Porto in Portugal. It is known as the 'Portuguese Venice' due to a network of canals which was completed in the early 1800s.

Boats known as barcos moliceiros - once used for collecting moliço seaweed - now carry visitors on trips along the canals.

Countless towns and and cities acrossThe Netherlandsare known for their canals, with Giethoorn in Overijssel known as a village 'Venice of the Netherlands'.

This small village of around 2,600 people is crossed by picturesque canals and 150 bridges, with some parts only accessible by boat.

Colmar in the Alsace region of France is another town with an area known as 'Little Venice' (Petit Venise).

Formerly an area where butchers, tanners and fishmongers operated, it is crossed by canals from the river Lauch.

Ålesund is a town in the west of Norway, noted forArt Nouveauarchitecture.

The town centre is located across a number of islands with narrow harbour inlets, and though known to some as a 'Venice of the North', there are no actual canals.

The Grand Tour

Women's education

Memories of studying abroad

Erasmus in Rotterdam

Since 1987, more than three million students have participated in the EU’s Erasmus exchange programme, spending some time studying in another EU country. However, students spending some of their education abroad is not a recent phenomenon.

The Erasmus programme - now known as Erasmus Plus - has been running for more than two decades, facilitating students across the EU to study in another country.

For many European students, the Erasmus Programme is their first time living and studying in another country. The name is an acronym, deriving fromEuRopean CommunityActionScheme for theMobility ofUniversityStudents. It is also named after Renaissance philosopher and Christian scholar Erasmus of Rotterdam.

Grand Tourists like Joseph Addison (1672 - 1719) were an early example of travelling for educational purposes. Since the Peace of Münster in 1648 facilitated travelling more safely across Europe, it was popular among young nobles to tour around European countries for several centuries.

It was considered that travel and liberal education would open the minds of the youth. Important stations during their travel were amongst othersParis, Venice, Milan, Rome and the German-speaking countries.

During their travels, they took lessons in languages, arts and sports. As travelling was very expensive at that period, only noble families could afford a Grand Tour for their children. But some, like Joseph Addison and Finnish painter Alexander Lauréus, also found a rich sponsor.

Most of the Grand Tourists were young men, as women were excluded from formal education for a long time. With the rise of feminism in the 19th century, women began to fight for their right to education - one of whom was Sophia Jex-Blake.

She was born in 1840 in England and visited several private schools. After her studies at Queen’s College in London, she travelled to the US to learn more about women’s education. Being in touch with one of the first female physicians, she started to wish to be a physician herself. She started working as an assistant in Boston but wanted to study medicine herself.

She wrote to the President of Harvard University, but the answer was: ‘There is no provision for the education of women in any department of this university’.

After returning to the UK with an idea sparked, she fought all her life for her right to education. Her application to study at the University of Edinburgh was first rejected, but after a legal fight, she became one of the first female students to study there in 1869.

Despite this, she was not allowed to graduate in Scotland and was forced to travel to the University of Berne in Switzerland to finish her studies.

For many, their years studying abroad remain a cherished memory for their whole life.

This certificate of Carl Frithiof Mattsson hung in his horologist’s workshop in Uppsala, Sweden for all his professional career from 1915 until 1949. It states that he has studied at the British Horological Institute from 1906 to 1907 and gives reference to his achievements.

Students not only return to their home countries with new influences and ideas. They also left traces at their temporary homes.

An interesting example of international students' culture is this first edition of the newspaperThe Chinese Studentfrom 1921, edited by the Edinburgh Chinese Students’ Union. Until today, there is a non-profit organisation to help Chinese students in Edinburgh find their way.

A recent example for studying abroad was shared by Natasha at our Europeana MigrationCollection Dayin Brussels in March 2018.

Her mother is Danish and her father is Dutch. They met in Spain, and her father took his motorcycle from the Netherlands to Denmark to visit his future wife. From then on, he decided to stay. She herself grew up in Denmark and was then undertaking her Erasmus study in Rotterdam in the Netherlands.

She chose to study in Rotterdam over any other city because of its similarity to Copenhagen as a maritime city as well as studying in the country her father is from.

She told us: 'I saw a nice quote that fits how I feel studying here in Rotterdam: ‘Heel de aarde is je vaderland’. The literal translation is that the whole world is your fatherland. Erasmus also uses the same quote and I feel as if this speaks to me as I am in my father's country and I do feel at home.'

From medicinal benefits to scientific interest

Preserving plant specimens in herbaria

Collecting plants from all over the world

Serving the community

There are more than 900 botanical gardens in Europe

There are more than 900 botanical gardens in Europe, a type of garden designed for the study, cultivation and propagation of the both native and foreign plant species.

Botanical gardens can be run by the state, municipality, private owners. Some botanical gardens are affiliated to botanical research institutes of universities.

Let’s learn more and enjoy their beauty through paintings, photos and illustrations.

From antiquity through to medieval times, plants with health properties have been cultivated. During the Renaissance, these gardens became officially recognised institutions, often belonging to universities.

Gradually, botanical gardens started to include plants without medicinal properties but considered interesting or beautiful. They were cultivated by specially-trained gardeners, studied and classified.

Many botanical gardens maintain herbaria - collections of pressed and dried plant specimens used for research. Herbaria are essential for plant classification. That’s why it’s very important for the preserved examples to include as many aspects of the plant species as possible - flowers, stems, leaves, seeds and fruits.

Herbaria play a crucial role in recording the world’s biodiversity.

With the increase in overseas travel and trade in the 18th and 19th centuries, more and more species were brought back to Europe.

They needed specific conditions to be able to survive the European climate. This is how the first heated orangeries, palm houses and greenhouses became a part of many public gardens as well as private residences and palaces.

As technology developed, these greenhouses could accommodate the needs of an increasing variety of plant species. Interest in collecting plants from all over the world reached beyond purely scientific purposes. It reflected imperialist ambitions and was a tool of colonial expansion, aiming to enhance the cultivation of crops interesting for economic reasons.

Botanical gardens are now a green oasis in many cities and can be a great escape from the hustle and bustle. Some of them are also tourist attractions or event venues.

Botanical gardens play an important role in raising environmental awareness through educational programmes and their work with communities.

So whether you need a moment of self-care, feel like taking some pictures of lush greenery for your Instagram, would like to learn something new or help theenvironment, you don't need to travel far - just visit a botanical garden nearby.

How changes in aviation policies introduced art to the airport

In Michel Houellebecq’s acclaimed novel „The Map and the Territory”, Jed, the protagonist, is visiting the arrival hall of the airport in Shannon, Ireland. Triggered by the spatial corridors and smart design he tries to imagine the atmosphere of the building during its first years, back in the 1940s. He elaborates about its past visitors: members of the societal elite, managers, architects of the post-war world.

Back then, aviation was the privilege of the rich as, until the arrival of the first jumbo jets in the early 1970s, flights were exclusive and very expensive. Flying was also considered to be safe as aircraft hijacking hadn’t been that common before the late ’60s. In Jed’s mind, airports of the mid-20th century had a completely different vibe than they have today: no crowds, no security checks and, last but not least, no anxiety.

The improved affordability of flights from the Boeing era onwards wasn’t the biggest shift in the history of the airport, though. More impactful were the aforementioned terrorist attacks which resulted in more elaborate security measures, including luggage screenings, full-body scans, etc. Today it is hard to fathom that no more than a few decades ago, passengers could just walk straight up to the gate. In the United States procedures changed in 1973, when airlines were required to screen their clients and their carry-on baggage. The introduction of X-ray scans has indeed decreased the number of hijacked aircraft, but at the same time irreversibly changed the atmosphere of the airport.

Therefore, it shouldn’t be surprising that when Brian Eno came up with the idea of recording his masterpieceAmbient 1. Music for Airports, released in 1978, he did so mostly with a view to defusing the anxious atmosphere of the terminal. This album - arguably one of the greatest in the history of ambient music - was inspired by a visit to the Cologne-Bonn airport and was intended to induce calmness and create space to think.

Used as an installation at LaGuardia Airport, New York, in the mid-80s,Ambient 1. Music for Airportsis composed in a way that may reflect a variety of moods and atmospheres rather than to suggest any one in particular. The album not only became a starting point for the ambient music genre, but was also at the vanguard of another trend: that of increasingly integrating art in the airport landscape.

One could even say that, in recent years, many airports have turned into galleries. That makes sense for various reasons. Since 9/11 passengers – especially those on international flights – are required to be present at the airport much earlier for security reasons. Checking in takes more time also because of the larger number of operating airlines and their passengers moving around the terminals. Departure halls have become huge waiting rooms with not much to do. So why not encourage people to use the time to admire great paintings or sculptures?

Engaging with art makes for a positive and inspiring pastime and helps to relieve any tension a passenger might experience before the flight. This idea has been elaborated in both permanent and temporary exhibitions at airports such as Charles de Gaulle in Paris, Schiphol in Amsterdam and Copenhagen Airport.

A short history of working as a waiter in restaurants

When you last ate at a restaurant or cafe, how was the service? Slow or fast, attentive or more relaxed? We all remember good and bad restaurant experiences - but perhaps we should spare a thought for those working in these roles.

Waiting is a profession that goes back centuries. There's more to the simple act of bringing food and drink to the table than you might think.

Waiting staff follow rules and guidelines determined by the type of restaurant or bar in which they work. Waiting staff carry out many different tasks, such as bringing food to and from diners, greeting customers, cleaning and preparing tables in advance of new diners, polishing dishes and silverware.

During all this, waiting staff are expected to be polite, courteous and friendly.

In some eateries, waiting staff are tasked with upselling, encouraging diners to order additional or specific food.

Waiting staff first appeared in the 1620s in taverns serving drinks. Our modern concept of eating out originated with the first restaurant opening in New York in the 1820s.

Prior to that, in most cultures, women were expected to prepare and serve food preparation.

Most early waiting staff were men, who wore white gloves to show that their fingers had not touched the food. Many served food by silver service - where waiters transfer food from a serving dish to the guest's plate.

Nowadays, there's a huge difference between being a waiter in a 5-star hotel or prestigious restaurant and that of a waiter in a small local cafe.

Attitudes to waiting staff across the continent vary.

In some countries, being a waiter or waitress is a perfect student job, flexible and easy work while studying or preparing for other jobs.

In other countries however, a waiter or waitress is a professional, with a level of service achieved after many hours of training and perfecting skills.

In some countries, tipping is customary - an essential way for waiting staff to supplement their income or help it reach acceptable standards. In other countries, tipping is unusual.

For some, waiting may seem like a simple enough job, but it's not for everyone. In our Europe at Work project, we heard from Nancy who told us about her one and only night as a bartender.

Artists and writers have portrayed restaurants, waiters and waitresses in many ways: when they want to reflect on authentic manual work or comment on the gender and status differences between waiting staff and diners.

Ecotourism originated in the 1970s and 80s in the midst of the environmental movement. Growing environmental concern mixed with discontent around mass tourism led to an increase in demand for nature-based experiences.

Ecotourism can be defined as 'tourism that focuses on conserving nature and educating visitors on the local environments and natural surroundings'. It is one of the overlapping components of sustainable tourism, the other being Ethical tourism (Responsible tourism).

With an ever-growing interest in environmentally conscious travel and activities, many places are offering more eco-friendly destination packages to attract visitors whilst preserving their nature. We'll explore and highlight a few eco-tourism activities across four different European countries.

Ireland is one of the greenest destinations in Europe. TheGreenbox, an ecotourism project that ran from 2006-2009 was able to establish and promote the northwest of Ireland as an eco-tourism destination highlighting the area's offer in terms of clean natural resources.Sustainable Travel Irelandgrew out of this project and, in turn, continues to promote and train Irish businesses around responsible and sustainable tourism.

Ireland has a plentitude of remarkable landscapes that can be found all throughout the country. The Cliffs of Moher are extremely popular with visitors who come to see the vast beauty of the cliffs over the Atlantic Ocean. Further south, hikers enjoy the Ring of Kerry, which is a 179-km-long circular route that takes travellers around the Iveragh Peninsula, the lakes of Killarney and other unique places.

Crete has gained legendary status for its healthy lifestyle due to a diet made up of homegrown seasonal produce rich in vegetables and fruits. Enagron village in Crete, known as an ecotourism village, incorporates all traditional aspects of Cretan life for visitors to experience and learn from. Some of its activities include hiking excursions around the village to learn about the history of the area, traditional cooking lessons on the Cretan diet and botanical walks.

Crete’s thriving agriculture and livestock rearing helps the island to not be completely dependent on tourism, allowing ecotourism projects like that of Enagron village and other similar initiatives around the island to flourish.

Norway is a leader of ecotourism initiatives. Political leaders have encouraged their citizens to respect and preserve nature. One of Norway’s greatest, well known and popular attractions is the Geiranger Fjord.

Tourists can choose a cycling tour around the fjord, go hiking or admire its beauty from a boat.Romsdal Aktiv, situated in Åndalsnes, is one of the first ecotourism companies in Norway providing nature-based and responsible activities since 1982. They continue to offer various local rivers and fjord-based activities as well as cave visits.

Romania’s Ecotourism Association (AER) aims to improve Romania’s ecotourism services that contribute to the conservation of nature and sustainable development.Eco-Romaniaprovides an abundance of eco destinations across Romania with activities such as cycling tours, river rafting, horseback riding, and trekking around the mountainous area of Ţara Dornelor.

The Transylvanian Highlands provide rich biodiversity, historic fortified churches, and a traditional lifestyle that visitors can experience. Eco-Romania shares a unique way of experiencing the various luscious and green destinations Romania has to offer by giving visitors to their website close-up virtual tours of the diverse locations creating a feeling of physically being there without leaving your home.

The benefits of tourism based on eco-friendly activities that minimize the impact on natural environments are far and wide, not only for visitors and the natural surroundings but also for local communities who thrive on their land being unchanged whilst receiving better sustainable economic opportunities.

Molly Malone by Jeanne Rynhart

1916 Memorial by Dora Sigerson Shorter

Father Mathew memorial by Mary Redmond

Exploring public art in Ireland's capital city

When we look at statues commemorating the lives of famous - and infamous - people on streets across Europe, how often do we know about the sculptors behind the statues?

While it can berare to find statues commemorating women, it can be even less common to find the work of female sculptors.

On the streets of Dublin, Ireland's capital city, we find three examples of public art by female sculptors - let's explore.

A popular folk song about Dublin has the refrain 'In Dublin's Fair City, where the girls are so pretty, I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone'.

Molly Malone, a fictional character in the song, is a fish seller who sells cockles and mussels from her cart. The fictional Molly dies young from a fever, and is now commemorated with a statue in the centre of Dublin.

The statue - erected in 1988 to celebrate Dublin's millennium as a city - is an artwork of sculptor Jeanne Rynhart. It originally was located near the busy shopping street Grafton Street, and later moved nearer the city's tourist office.

Rynhart was born in Dublin in 1946, and studied in both Dublin and Coventry in the UK. Returning to Ireland, she established a gallery and sculpture workshop.

Her artworks can also be found in other cities and towns in Ireland: a statue of Mary O'Connor (known as the 'Rose of Tralee') in Tralee, County Kerry, as well as two statues of Annie Moore - the first Irish immigrant to the United States - in Cobh, County Cork and at Ellis Island, New York. Rynhart died in June 2020.

Glasnevin Cemetery in the north of Dublin is a large graveyard, with 132 acres. It holds the graves and memorials of notable historic figures from the history of Ireland.

One such memorial commemorates the Easter 1916 Rising - a sculpture by artist Dora Sigerson Shorter.

The marble sculpture is housed in a structure made of Irish limestone, and shows a man at the feet of a female figure.

The above two images are courtesy of theStatues of DublinInstagram account

Sigerson Shorter dedicated the memorial to the executed leaders of the 1916 Rising which had deeply affected her - so much so than when she died two years later, it was said she had ‘died of a broken heart’.

In addition to sculpture, Dora Sigerson Shorter was also a poet.On Europeana, you can read two anthologies of her poetry.

Several statues adorn Dublin's main street O'Connell Street. A memorial to Father Mathew now stands in the shadow of the 120 metre high Spire of Dublin (moved from a previous location on the street).

The large sandstone statue commemorates Catholic priest Theobald Mathew who found and led teetotal societies in the 19th century, espousing abstinence from alcohol.

At its height in the 1840s, the movement enrolled 3 million people - more than half the adult population of Ireland at the time. Today, streets, bridges, churches and more in Irish cities and town bear his name.

The statue on O'Connell Street, which was unveiled in the early 1890s, was the work of Dublin sculptor Mary Redmond who had won a competition to design the memorial.

Redmond had studied in Dublin and Rome and was known primarily for sculpting portraits and busts. In the same year her monumental statue of Father Mathew was unveiled, she married and moved first to London and subsequently to Florence.

Madame du Deffand’s Correspondence

Voltaire and Rousseau’s Letters to Panckoucke

The “Republic of Letters” was established in Italy with the first humanists. Their abundant correspondence, which included letters that were both personal and intellectual, continued to the Enlightenment.

The “Republic of Letters” was established in Italy with the first humanists. Their abundant correspondence, which included letters that were both personal and intellectual, continued to the Enlightenment.

The Italian scholar and poet Francesco Petrarca (1304-1374) was a towering intellectual and is considered the founder of Humanism. He was inspired by the writers of classical Rome, in particular Cicero and Virgil.

Petrarch’s corpus of letters is organised as an exchange of intellectuals in perpetual contact with other intellectuals without the recipients’ names.HisEpistolae familiaresdeal with family matters and theEpistolarum rerum seniliumcontains letters of old age and, in the last epistle, Petrarca’s autobiography.



Francisci Petrarchae poetae laureati Florentini Epistolarum rerum senilium libri XVII,ff. 1v, 2r, Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana, Firenze.

A letter in theEpistolarum rerum seniliumsent to Boccaccio a year before his death is emblematic of the artistic correspondence between the two intellectuals: it is a sort of spiritual testament. Boccaccio invites him to abandon his studies to save his strength, while Petrarca expressed the desire to continue his literary work, the true meaning of his life, to the end.

From the Middle Ages onwards, correspondence continued to forge links between different parts of society. During the Enlightenment, correspondence was a major part of social interaction among the elite, as important as cafés, salons and clubs. It was a way of continuing the conversations begun in person in a space that was at once intimate and intellectual.



Letter from d’Alembert to Madame du Deffand(Bibliothèque nationale de France - NoC-OKLR)

Madame du Deffand(1697-1780), a brilliant intellectual, opened a salon in 1740 where European aristocrats and the literary, scientific and artistic elite could meet.



Portrait of Madame du Deffand, in ‘Œuvres complètes de Voltaire’ (Bibliothèque nationale de France - NoC-OKLR)

She continued theconversationsheld in her salon inher lettersto the bright minds of her day. Hercorrespondentsinclude many well-known people, some of whom have since become important figures in the Republic of Letters, such as Madame de Staël, thePrésident Hénault,Montesquieuandd'Alembert. She is best known for her epistolary relationship withVoltaire, with whom she exchanged letters of over a period of nearly 50 years, and for herromantic correspondence with Horace Walpoletowards the end of her life.

Madame du Deffand's intelligence and conversational talents fascinated her contemporaries and her salon was known throughout Europe, particularly through Grimm's 'Correspondance littéraire’.

Voltaireis perhaps one of the best known figures of the Republic of Letters in the 18th century. In 1828, the letters that he andJean-Jacques Rousseauhad sent to Charles-Joseph Panckoucke, editor of the 'Encyclopédie méthodique', were published.

Voltaire and Rousseau's letters tell of news in the publishing world, intellectual life and the project to publish a supplement to the 'Encyclopédie', as suggested byDenis Diderot. These letters also show the friendship each of the philosophers felt for the editor.

The Republic of Letters made possible the diffusion of thought and created the cultural unity that has led to knowledge overcoming territorial and national borders.

Temporary triumphal arches adorned Lisbon to mark the occasion

On 12 August 1687, Portuguese King Pedro II married Maria Sophia of Neuburg in Lisbon amid great celebrations - with triumphal arches, fireworks, figures and statues, a labyrinth and a royal ship. An album of drawings by João dos Reis held by the National Libary of Portugal offer a detailed graphic record of these parties.

Royal weddings with foreign princes or princesses were mainly aimed at reinforcing alliances with other kingdoms, as well as ensuring lines of succession.

This marriage was no exception.

King Pedro II had been married before, but his only daughter Isabel Luísa, Princess of Beira, who was heir to the throne, did not have children. Marriage with her had been declined by many European sovereigns due to her ill health (she died in 1690, aged 21, from smallpox).

Maria Sophia came from a royal family in what is now Germany.

In 1685, her father Philip William of Neuburg became the Elector of the Palatinate, ruling a territory that was part of the Holy Roman Empire. Two of his daughters had married in important alliances - Eleonor Magdalene was the Holy Roman Empress, while Maria Anna became the Queen of Spain.

Thus the wedding of King Pedro II to Maria Sophia was an important marriage to be celebrated - hopefully ensuring royal succession and bringing the Portuguese crown closer to that of Spain.

The cover of João dos Reis' album shows  an allegorical design celebrating Portugal's alliance with Germany.

Maria travelled from Heidelberg to Lisbon in July and August 1687, arriving in Lisbon 12 August 1687 amid great celebration. The marriage was celebrated that day by the Archbishop of Lisbon at Ribeira Palace.

At the palace, a French garden from the Count of Ericeira’s palace had been recreated, with fountains, Italian statues, dolphins and fireworks.

The Queen’s fleet arrived in Lisbon on August 12, 1687. There were numerous boats along the river Tagus and anchored warships adorned with flags. At 3pm,  Pedro II embarked in the royal brigantine, entered the queen's chamber to greet her, and both came aboard the royal brigantine at the sound of the repeated volleys of the armadas.

The celebrations were not only marked by the royal family but also the whole nation. For this special occasion, Lisbon was adorned with temporary arches and other structures projecting an idea of ​​modernity.

The arch of the Germans exalted the Queen's ancestors, as well as the main German cities, with mythological gods in the mix.

The arches and porches were made of wood, covered with several layers of plaster and cloth which were then painted. Producing each arch was extremely expensive, so, at the end of the festivities, they were disassembled and stored to be reused on other occasions.

João dos Reis’ album consists of 30 drawings, 4 of which were in colour. He was a Jesuit mathematician, who had been born in Solothurn, Switzerland, with the German name Johann König. The manuscript belonged to the Library of the Counts of Tarouca and was purchased by the National Library of Portugal in 1971.

Other manuscripts representing these festivities are held in Ajuda Library and in the Library of the University of Coimbra, both with drawings by the architect Luís Nunes Tinoco.

Henri Cassiers' artworks promoted tourist locations in Belgium and the Netherlands.

When we think of the Netherlands and the lowlands, we often think of windmills, picturesque villages and canals.

This image is in part due to Flemish artist Henri Cassiers, whose artworks were ofen used for publicity, promoting tourist locations within Belgium and the Netherlands.

His art appears on posters, postcards and other advertising materials, as well as in guide books.

Born in Antwerp in 1858, Cassiers' career coincided with the rise of the tourist industry in which cities, towns and countries began to market themselves as destinations. The simultaneous rise of printing technologies meant his work was reproduced many times.

Cassiers' drawings and paintings show archetypal, idealised scenes of life in Flanders and the Netherlands - its countryside, villages and towns.

In particular, Cassiers was drawn to portray maritime life - shipping, fishing and boats. His illustrations for transatlantic shipping lines are vivid and striking, reflecting the look of early advertising through images with Art Nouveau influences.

Veils and drapery

Weeping willows

Obelisks

Broken columns

Urns

Ivy

Skulls

IHS

Chi-Rho

Scrolls

Sunbursts

What do the symbols on headstones, tombs and graves mean?

Visiting a cemetery is not always a sad and sombre occasion. Graveyards are filled with stories of historical people and their lives. Tombs and gravestones are small pieces of architecture, with symbolic meaning.

Let's explore the meaning behind some motifs found in cemeteries across Europe.

Drapery on a grave is a veil that separates the world of the living from that of the dead. Often used in conjunction with other motifs (urns, columns, Death’s heads, flowers), they symbolise the soul passing into the afterlife.

Funerary shrouds were used since prehistory to clothe and therefore protect the deceased on their afterlife journey. It’s this association with protection that is also present in Christian graves, an allusion to God’s protection until Resurrection.

Weeping willows are symbols of mourning and remembrance due to the forlorn drooping of the branches. Willows were associated with numerous feminine deities and the moon by pre-Christian religions in the Mediterranean and Central Asia.

The plant is also associated with immortality and rebirth given the hardiness of the family and re-emergence every spring of the fuzzy leaf buds. This motif is often used in conjunction with a female figure in mourning.

Obelisks became popular gravestone motifs in 19th-century Britain due to the discovery of the Rosetta Stone in 1801 and the English occupation of Egypt. To ancient Egyptians, obelisks were petrified rays of sunlight where the sun god Ra lived. In graveyards they symbolise ancient godliness, greatness.

Broken columns signify lives cut short: those who died young or in the prime of their life. Often these symbols have been used when the living died suddenly. The columns range from classical to modern designs, often combined with other symbols and decorative elements like wreaths, doves, urns, lilies.

Urns became a popular funerary motif in the 19th century. They represent immortality: containing the earthly remains of a body whilst the soul has ascended to the afterlife. Many urns are draped with shrouds, festooned with garlands, inspired by ancient Grecian and Egyptian designs.

Ivy on a gravestone symbolises immortality. The hardiness of the plants - the near impossibility of ridding your garden of the vines - makes them motifs for regeneration and endless life.

Skulls or death's heads are memento mori, reminders of our mortality. They were popular funerary ornaments in the 16th and 17th centuries, but fell out of fashion by the 1800s. Their use as gravestone motifs waned as they were considered morbid and the stuff of Gothic novels.

IHS is the Latin phrase ‘Iesus Hominum Salvator’ which means ‘Jesus saviour of mankind’. On a gravestone, it symbolises resurrection and the afterlife. The letters can be written in a number of ways, sometimes resembling $.

Chi-Rho (XP) are the first letters in the Greek word for Christ, Khristos. The symbol comes from Emperor Constantine’s vision instructing him to inscribe a 'heavenly divine symbol' on the his soldiers' shields. On a tombstone, it signifies the resurrection.

Scrolls symbolise a person’s life: the past rolled up, the present (moment of death) on display, the future in the afterlife yet to be revealed. Scrolls also signify honour and a memorial - and often represent the Bible and other sacred and ancient texts. Their use as gravestone motifs also reflect neoclassical and Egyptian revival trends during the 18th and 19th centuries.

The sunburst is a very ancient symbol simultaneously linked with death (sunset) and resurrection (sunrise). It speaks to the passing over from this life into the next.

Before the 19th century, most graveyards in the West were designed facing the east in view of the rising sun. The sunburst motif is depicted in numerous ways: as arrows and rays of light, in geometric patterns resembling many-pointed stars, flowers, and orange slices.

Stemming from the collection of Francesc Martorell i Peña who died in 1878.

The Martorell Museum of Geology in Barcelona was the first building in the city to be a public museum.

The museum is located inside Barcelona's Ciutadella Park, housed in an impressive building with large stone columns.

The museum stems from the collection of trader, archaeologist, scholar and collector Francesc Martorell i Peña.

Throughout his life, he gathered a large collection of objects, including specimens of natural history - zoology, botany, geology, fossils, archaeological objects, books and coins.

When he died in 1878, he left his collection to Barcelona City Council, together with his library and financial resources to build the museum.

On September 25, 1882 the museum was opened by Barcelona's Mayor Francesc Rius i Taulet, initially as a museum of archaeology and natural sciences.

The historic museum was the origin of the Barcelona's Museum of Natural Sciences. Since 1924, the museum has been dedicated entirely to geology collections.

Unfortunately, it's not currently possible to visit this historic museum - it closed for renovations in 2010 and has yet to re-open. But it can be seen from outside during a visit to Ciutadella Park.

Find inspiration for your holidays at home in literature

Have you ever been so consumed by a book that it almost felt like travelling to the story’s places?

Walking alongside the protagonist across a busy marketplace, glancing over their shoulders on snowy mountain tops or feeling the cold sea spray during a stormy ship passage?

Through literature, we can travel in our minds to places we might never see ourselves or that are fictitious in the first place. In times of the COVID-19 pandemic, discovering far-away places can be hard - so let’s travel to new horizons in Europe with the help of historic works of literature.

A prime example for getting to know new places through the written word is ‘The Wonderful Adventures of Nils’ by Selma Lagerlöf, one of Sweden’s most famous authors of the 20th century and the first woman to win the Nobel prize.

Her book takes you on a journey through all of Sweden’s historical provinces, following in the footsteps of Nils Holgersson, a naughty young boy from Southern Sweden who is shrunk to the size of a thumb and travels the country on the back of geese.

In 1902, Lagerlöf was commissioned by the Swedish National Teachers’ Association to write a geography reader for public schools in Sweden. At that time, she was already an acclaimed author having published several novels, such as ‘Gösta Berling's Saga’.

Although she only published her first novel at the age of 33, she had been a keen reader and poet since her early childhood. Although the family struggled with her father’s alcoholism and illness, Selma found her way as a teacher and became involved early with the women’s movement.

When she won a prize from the Swedish magazineIdun, focusing on women’s equality and literature, she was able to publish her first novel - immediately kicking off her career as an author.

For her novel about Nils Holgersson, she researched the Swedish geography and folklore, flora and fauna for three years.

Her protagonist lives among wild animals and follows the wild geese along their annual journey to northern Sweden, getting to know local fairytales and legends, meeting people such as the Swedish king and Selma Lagerlöf herself.

Cultural heritage plays an important role in the novel. Nils gets to know the regional highlights, such asVisby,Lapland,Karlskrona, thelandscape of Southern Ölandand theFalun Mine- which today are world heritage sites.

The contemporary newspaper ‘Ny Tid’ reviewed the novel enthusiastically after its publication in 1906/07:'It acquaints the children with Sweden’s nature; interest them in its bird world, both tame and wild; in its domestic and forest animals, even in its rats. It explains its vegetation, its soil, its mountain-formations, its climatic conditions. It gives you customs, superstitions, and the folklore in the different sections of the country. It takes in farming industry, manors and factories, cities and peasant-cabins, and even dog-kennels. It has a word for everything; an interest in and for everything.'

How the emerging travel industry inspired trends in fashion and accessories in the 20th century.

As travelling popularised in the 20th century, the importance of the journey as an integral part of travel rose significantly. All available means of transportation, from train and car to bus, boat or plane, called for infrastructures with a bespoke architecture allowing them to function efficiently as places of departure and arrival. They also spurred the demand for clothes that would be practical yet stylish enough to make people feel perfectly dressed for any adventure they might be embarking on.

In the 19th century, railway networks expanded significantly as travelling by train became more widespread. But being on the move very much equalled getting dirty and messy. This is why heavy overcoats and weather-proof outerwear were so popular and, indeed, necessary.

Travelling by car wasn’t much more convenient: vehicles often had open roofs and required drivers and passengers to be suitably geared up in long linen coats offering protection from wind and dust, as well as goggles, hats and gloves.

However, by the early 1900s, transportation options allowed for cleaner, more comfortable ways of travelling. This presented an opportunity to design more varied and fashionable travel outfits.

By the 1950s, overcoats and other protective items of clothing were no longer necessary, but were still being produced and sold as travel gear, becoming fashionable additions to many people’s wardrobes.

As for other means of transportation, from at least the 1920s onwards, fashion magazines such asVoguepublished articles advising women on the most stylish outfits to wear on boats and airplanes.

By the time commercial aviation came into its stride, travel gear had become a well-balanced mix of style and utility. The weight and capacity restrictions for luggage spurred designers to work with lighter materials and adapt their patterns to combine protection with comfort and style. The use of new synthetic fibres and fabrics, such as rayon, viscose and nylon, all extremely resistant and easy to carry around, became widespread from the 1930s onwards.

Another important trend was the use of zippers, making clothes easier to wear and allowing travellers to quickly add or remove garments during the journey.

The relationship between style and travel not only resulted in bespoke pieces of clothing. Another category of fashionable items that grew considerably owing to the development of new modes of travel in the 20th century was that of accessories. Travel bags and luggage, among others, became central to recognising the stylish traveller.

Bags had to be designed to protect and carry the valuable items people wanted to hold onto during their trips, yet soon stopped being mere containers and entered the realm of luxury, turning into symbols of status to differentiate wealthy people from ‘ordinary’ travellers.

This differentiation made the fortune of specialized brands, of which some are relevant to this day. That of Louis Vuitton, for instance, which was founded as a leather goods company in Paris at the beginning of the 1900s. And of Gucci, the Italian brand born thanks to the intuition of a former valet who used to welcome guests in a famous hotel in London.

As Europeans are rediscovering their local natural surroundings, confined to their immediate area due to lockdowns and travel restrictions, hiking and bikepacking have become prime holiday past-times this year.

But how did the sport of walking for the sake of walking come to be? When did the network of hiking trails criss-crossing Europe start popping up everywhere, and who put them there? This blog explores the history of hiking in Europe, from Wandervögel to Grande Randonnée.

The idea of walking for leisure, for introspection and to reconnect with nature resonated with the artists of the Romantic period, in the 19th Century.

Painters, poets and writers turned to woods and mountains to be alone, connect with their surroundings, and with their inner emotions. One of the main exponents of the Romantic era wasCaspar David Friedrich, famous for his 'Wanderer above the sea of Fog'. He and other Romantic artists used nature as a canvas for their own emotions and thoughts, constantly comparing and contrasting the relationship between humans and nature.

Romantic poets and writers turned to walking through nature and writing about their experiences and travels as well.Wordsworth,Keats,Coleridge,R.L. StevensonandHenry David Thoreauall undertook long-distance hikes or secluded themselves in nature. Travel writing about walking tours became a popular genre, spearheaded by Robert Louis Stevenson's 'Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes' in 1879.

'I travel not to go anywhere, but to go'

- R.L. Stevenson, 'Travels with a donkey in the Cévennes'.

The increasing industrialisation and urbanisation in the 19th century resulted in more and more people wanting to escape the polluted, over-crowded cities to enjoy exercise and fresh air in the countryside.

Soon, organisations sprung up that functioned as hiking clubs. Most of these clubs originated in the second half of the 19th Century, like theRamblersin the UK, TheNorwegian Trekking Association, theSwiss Alpine Club, and the GermanWandervögel.

Most of these clubs intended to organise hiking outings in groups or advocate for walkers' rights.

The German Wandervögel were unique in different ways, mainly consisting of youths and focusing heavily on German nationalism. The Wandervögel protested the on-going industrialisation by championing a frugal way of life, decrying authority and top-down governance, and valuing a return to nature as well as their Teutonic roots. Groups of Wandervögel often carried musical instruments with them, reviving old German folk songs while hiking through nature.

Marking paths and tracing routes specifically meant for hiking became more and more popular in the 20th Century. A lot of the hiking clubs created in the 19th Century started building and maintaining their own hiking trails.

As the 20th Century progressed, more focus went towards building long-distance trails: hiking paths spanning hundreds of kilometers that could be walked in sections or braved in a single multi-day trek.

The first long-distance footpath in Europe was theHungarian National Blue Trail, inaugurated in 1938. At the time, it covered almost 1000 km of Hungary's natural landscape.

About ten years later, in 1947, the first French long-distance trail was created. In the 1930s, France had introduced the concept of paid vacation, which suddenly gave workers free time to spend however they wanted.

Jean Loiseau, a Frenchman inspired by his experience in scouting and hiking clubs, decided to start marking long-distance footpaths so people could go on multi-day treks throughout the French countryside during their vacations. In France, long-distance hiking trails were calledGR paths, which stands for Grande Randonnées, or'long walks'.

GR paths and organisations maintaining those paths can today be found in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, Germany and the United Kingdom.

The longest and most recent long-distance hiking trails in Europe are theEuropean long-distance paths, or E-Paths.

These Paths often partly follow and connect national GR paths and pass through many different countries. The E-paths are maintained by theEuropean Ramblers' Association. European long-distance paths became possible after the formation of the European Union, resulting in open border crossings that allowed anyone to freely move between countries.

Currently there are 12 E-Paths, covering more than 70,000 kilometres.

With tens of thousands of kilometres of hiking paths available in Europe, most Europeans won't have to look far for a trail to trek. If you're looking for an escape to nature this summer in your own area, why not look up which hiking paths you could take?

A group of Scandinavian artists gathered in Skagen in the 19th century

When summer comes, we often leave cities and head to the countryside and seaside with friends.

Nowadays we maybe go to Ibiza or Provence, but a group of artists and their families in 19th century Denmark headed for Skagen, a fishing village in the north of Denmark.

The Skagen Painters were a group of Scandinavian artists who gathered there from around the 1870s to the end of the 19th century.

Holidaying in Skagen, they were inspired by the village's scenery, landscape and fishing community - all of which were captured by their many paintings.

Though rooted in the specifics of Skagen, their artworks also capture many universal summer activities - taking long walks on the beach, swimming in the sea, soaking up the sun, enjoying picnic, walking in the woods - all the things that make for enjoyable summer days.

The artworks of painterP.S. Krøyerparticularly capture this. They feature the white sandy beaches and beautiful blue skies of Skagen, where at its peak in June and July, the sun rises around 4am and sets around 10pm.

These artists' depictions of Skagen are summer memories made in paint. We hope you enjoyed this short selection of Skagen paintings - you can learn much more about theSkagen Painterson Wikipedia.

Symbolising the games, host cities and sport

Throughout the history of the modern Olympic Games, designs and posters have been used to symbolise the Olympic movement, host city and country and sporting ideals. Let’s look at some examples from the archives.

There was no poster used at the first Olympic Games in Athens in 1896, but the cover of the Olympic Games program was used.

The inscription ‘776-1896’, the horseshoe-shaped Stadium, the Acropolis, the Koris - the personification of the Goddess Athena - ready to offer the crown of victory, symbolise the connection between the ancient Games and those of the modern age.

The Stockholm Games were the fifth occurrence of the modern Olympic Games. One of the most important advertising measures taken was the adoption of an official Olympic poster.

Known as the ‘Swedish Masterpiece’, the 1912 Olympics were the best organised and most efficiently-run Games to that date.

The Swedish Olympic Committee chose a design by Olle Hjortzberg, a member of the Royal Academy, a multi-talented artist best known for his Christian art. With strong influences from Art Nouveau, the poster depicts a naked athlete in the center, in a classic Greek Olympic pose, raising the Swedish flag while behind him other athletes raise flags of their countries, representing nations moving towards the common goal of the Olympic Games.

The central figure's nakedness reflected the Ancient Olympics when athletes were competing naked, but was criticised so Hjortzberg covered the athlete with decorative ribbons in Art Nouveau style.

The poster was printed in 15 different languages ​​and sent around the world to promote the Games.

The 1936 Olympics were held in a tense, politically-charged atmosphere. The Nazi Party had risen to power in 1933 and its racist policies led to international debate about a boycott of the Games.

Fearing a mass boycott, the International Olympic Committee pressured the German government and received assurances that the Games would not be used to promote Nazi ideology. Adolf Hitler’s government, however, routinely failed to deliver on such promises.

Pamphlets and speeches about the racial superiority were held. The Reich Sports Field, a newly constructed sports complex that covered 325 acres and included four stadiums, was draped in Nazi banners and symbols. Nonetheless, the attraction of a spirited sports competition was too great and, in the end, 49 countries chose to attend the Olympic Games in Berlin.

The Games were televised for the first time, transmitted by closed circuit to specially equipped theatres in Berlin. The 1936 Games also introduced the torch relay by which the Olympic flame is transported from Greece.

The poster - by artist Franz Würbel - aimed to do three things: show the importance of the Olympic Games, call attention to Berlin as the host city and publicise the Games in an effective and internationally understandable manner.

The poster depicted the Brandenburg Gate as a landmark of the host city, in front of which stands a monumental figure of a crowned winner, in a classical realism style which was popular with Hitler. The five rings in their original colors blue, yellow, black, green and red are depicted on the background and at the bottom the dates of the Games.

Graphic art was the communications vehicle for the Olympics in Mexico City in 1968, the first time a Latin American country hosted the Games.

The poster was designed by Lance Wyman and Peter Murdoch.

Pedro Ramirez Vázquez, an architect and humanist, was president of the organising committee of the Mexico City Olympic. He led a communication campaign with the idea of the Games leaving a legacy of peace where young people will focus on what unites us and not on what separates us, in the spirit of the Ancient Olympic Games.

In the tumultuous atmosphere of 1968 - with student protests and clashes with police in Mexico and around the world and the Civil Rights Movement in the United States - Ramirez Vázquez fought to have the iconic moment that shocked the world included in the Olympiad official video, when the two black athletes, Tommie Smith (gold) and John Carlos (bronze) rose their black-gloved fists in solidarity with the anti-racism movement in the United States.

A wide selection of posters for various posters was developed for the Olympic Games in Munich.

Numerous posters were produced for special occasions (pre-Olympic-exhibitions, the torch relay, etc.) in addition to those for sports and cultural events.

There were also posters with photos or just lettering; diagrams, maps or charts and tables were also given the character of posters. The sports and cultural posters formed the focal point, using different methods within the limits of the elements determining the image of the Games.

The twenty-one sports posters were intended to be intelligible in a majority of international cultures and appeal to most people throughout the whole world.

The Munich posters intensified the use of photography as a way to promote the Olympic Games, but expressed in form and colour over in addition to the Olympic logo. Great care was taken to select typical athletic situations for the photographs.

Each poster had a left-to-right motion, with horizontal lines. Another important feature of every sports poster is its form consisting of cut outs. Thus almost every figure and other elements were bled into the page, suggesting action.

Thus by focusing on typical aspects of each sport, the posters became symbols which could be comprehended immediately by each viewer. The use of various posters together also increased the effect of the individual poster. Colours and signal effects mutually complemented each other.

Rarely has an Olympic logo provoked as much debate and controversy as that of the 2012 London Olympics. Designed by creative company Wolff Olins, the London Olympic Committee named the logo a symbol for ‘Everyone’s Olympics’.

The design of the logo rejects traditional typography, preferring an abstract form of 2012.

Critics argued that it seemed to have been adapted for a younger audience, seeking inspiration from the graffiti language - a style that excludes older people.

For the Olympic posters, 12 British artists were invited to design their own version of a poster for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, expressing what the spirit of the Games means to them.

The artists were: Tracey Emin, Martin Creed, Rachel Whiteread, Chris Ofili, Gary Hume, Anthea Hamilton, Howard Hodgkin, Bridget Riley, Fiona Banner, Michael Craig-Martin, Sarah Morris and Bob and Roberta Smith.

Read about one of the most famous and lavishly illustrated manuscripts made in England in the Romanesque era.

Thanks to the patronage ofThe Polonsky Foundation, the Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF) and the British Library have established an unprecedented partnership in the field of medieval manuscripts. 400 manuscriptsheld by the BnF, and 400 held by the British Library were selected because of their importance for the history of French and English relations in the Middle Ages, as well as for their artistic, historical or literary value. Written between the 8th and the 12th centuries, they represent the variety and spread of the intellectual production of the early Middle Ages and the Romanesque era.

TheCanterbury Psalter (BnF, Mss., Latin 8846)is one of the most famous and lavishly illustrated manuscripts made in England in the Romanesque era. It was produced in the late-12th century and illuminated around 1200 in the scriptorium of the Benedictine monastery of Christ Church of Canterbury, an archiepiscopal seat and one of the richest ecclesiastical houses in England.

The Canterbury Psalter is extraordinarily rich textually as well as visually. It includes two Latin versions of the Psalms along with theHebraicum, a translation made from Hebrew that was never used liturgically. Moreover, there is a fourth version present in the interlinear translation of the Psalms into Anglo-Norman French, written above theHebraicumtext. A few lines of Old English are also included in the Psalter. As such, it embodies an attempt to embrace all available knowledge on the Psalms, each translation contributing to the understanding.

The illuminations of the Psalter illustrate how manuscripts and their models travelled in the Middle Ages. A single artist presumably painted the eight full-page prefatory images of the biblical story and 47 large illustrations for individual Psalms. The artist was apparently following the iconographic programme found in another Ppsalter copied in the same scriptorium in the mid-12th century by a monk named Eadwine. TheEadwine Psalter, which now belongs to Trinity College, Cambridge (MS R.17.1), is itself an adaptation of a Carolingian model, theUtrecht Psalter(Utrecht, Universiteitsbibliotheek, MS Bibl. Rhenotraiectinae I Nr 32.), which was at Canterbury for a period in the Middle Ages. The artistic style of the Canterbury Psalter is similar to two manuscripts:Oxford, Bodleian Library, Auct. E. inf. 2andBnF, ms. Latin 10433.

The Canterbury Psalter is also called the “Anglo-Catalan Psalter” because its text and its decoration were completed in Catalonia where the manuscript travelled during the fourteenth century. 52 miniatures and several historiated initials have been linked to a Catalan workshop of an artist called the San Marco Master, who was active in Barcelona around the mid-14th century.

One indication of the great interest in the manuscript is its eventful history. After its stay in Catalonia, it arrived in the library of Marguerite of Austria, then in that of her niece Marie of Hungary, the queen of Hungary and Charles Quint’s sister. After her death, it joined the collections of the Burgundian library in Brussels that were acquired by the French national library in 1794.

More than 60 cities across Europe have held the title.

For the past 35 years, more than 60 cities and regions across Europe - from Paphos to Porto, Reykjavik to Riga - have been named theEuropean Capital of Culture.

The title celebrates a city's heritage and its contribution to European culture. Each year is marked with exhibitions, artistic programmes, theatre shows, dance, opera, music and other projects specific to individual cities.

In 1985, Athens in Greece was chosen as the first European City of Culture.

The initiative was launched by then European Community based on an idea from Greece's Minister of Culture Melina Mercouri and her French counterpart Jack Lang, to highlight and celebrate the richness ofEuropean culturein an annual programme.

Initially known as European City of Culture, from 1999, the title European Capitals of Culture has been used.

The idea was to highlight the role of cultural connections and the importance of culture in European integration, which had previously largely been focused around economics and financial benefits.

At the end of the 1980s, Florence,Amsterdam, Berlin andParisfollowed Athens as European Cities of Culture.

In 2000, to celebrate the millennium in a special way, nine cities - Avignon in France, Bergen in Norway, Bologna in Italy, Brussels in Belgium, Helsinki in Finland, Kraków in Poland, Prague in Czech Republic, Reykjavík in Iceland and Santiago de Compostela in Spain - were chosen to hold the title, including two in states that were to join the European Union in 2004.

Since the beginning, cities in every EU member have held the title.

In 2004, a rotation system was introduced to ensure that each EU member state holds the title. From 2007 to 2020, two cities in different countries have held the title. From 2021 onwards, a third city will be added every third year from a country that is not an EU member.

Cities are chosen through a bidding process, in a similar way to how sport competitions and other cultural programmes are selected. An international panel of cultural experts assess individual cities' proposals according to criteria, and choose a winner.

Competition for the title is now strong. In 2016, 16 cities applied when Spain was due to hold the title. 15 Italian cities competed to host the event in 2019, with Matera winning.

In 2020, the title is held byGalway in Ireland and Rijeka in Croatia.

Holding the title can bring tourism andmedia attention, as well as funding to create or consolidate cultural networks and advocacy within a city.

Some cities have seen great, long-lasting benefits from holding the title - local pride, increased investment in the arts, increased tourism - while others have been criticised due to lack of local involvement, inclusion and long-term impact.

The idea has also inspired other regions of the world - since the 1990s, the Arab League of UNESCO have chosen an Arab Capital of Culture, with an American Capital of Culture initiative beginning in 1997. Similarly, the European Union have chosen a European Youth Capital title since 2009. Several nations - including Italy, Lithuania and the United Kingdom - now also hold national 'Capital of Culture' initiatives.

Madame de Sévigné's Letters to her Daughter

Read about the famous epistolary cases from 14th and 17th century when private correspondence entered public life.

Read about the famous epistolary cases from 14th and 17th century when private correspondence entered public life.

The merchant society Ricciardi of Lucca went bankrupt at the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries. The correspondence of this company consists of sixteen letters written between 1295 and 1303; they are kept at The National Archives in London.

This corpus deals with the default of the banking company. It is exceptional in that the initially private correspondence about internal disagreements rises to the level of a public exchange. This was due to the introduction of thearbitration commissionelected by the City of Lucca toreview the balance of the company.

They were unable to meet the cash needs of the most important clients, King Edward I of England and King Philip the Fair of France. Pope Boniface VIII interceded for the merchant society around Europe throughpapal legates.

Edward I and Philip the Fair then ordered theclosure and seizure ofRicciardi di Lucca’s books and the closure of their British and French offices, jeopardizing the fate of the company to the point of failure.

The letters have given modern historians a glimpse of the merchant reality of the High Middle Ages and the relations between the pope, great ecclesiastics, public bodies and branches of the company scattered throughout Europe.

Look no further for more information on thecirculation of precious fabrics,events linked to clashes between white and black Guelphs in Tuscany,ambassadors on behalf of the town of Luccaand other activities that show the relevance of this corpus of the largest bank in Western Europe in those years together with theGran TavolaofBuonsignori of Siena.

Madame de Sévigné’s correspondence provides one of the best examples of the balance between courtly writing and individual expression.

Marie de Rabutin-Chantal, marquise de Sévigné(1626-1696) began a diligent correspondence with her daughter,Françoise Marguerite, when the latter moved away in 1671 after marrying Monsieur de Grignan, the King's lieutenant governor in Provence.

This epistolary relationship went on for 25 years, at a frequency of several letters a week. They tell of events related to life at the court ofLouis XIV, such as the notorious suicide ofVatel, maître d'hôtel to the Prince of Condé, as well as theGrande Mademoiselle's marriage and the arrest of Lauzun.

Despite the Marquise's complaints to the contrary, mother and daughter saw each other quite often. Madame de Sévigné gradually became aware of the literary power of her writing, which led her to exaggerate her feelings: "So, my daughter, I enjoy writing to you: what a terrible thing, as it must mean I enjoy your absence!"

While it was understood that the letters would be passed around a select circle of acquaintances, these private letters later became public when some of them were published. In the1725 edition, the selected letters presented a chronicle of public events, while the1726 editionrevealed more personal aspects of the correspondence.

Pauline de Grignan, the Marquise's granddaughter, later gave Perrin all the letters to be published in two editions (1734 and 1754). These letters were censored and reworked to make the contents more tasteful and less daring.Marcel Proustwould later connect Madame de Sévigné's work with his own: in 'In Search of Lost Time', the grandmother is a devoted reader of the Marquise.

Over the centuries, and especially with the rise of individuality during the Renaissance, the focus of letter writing shifted from chronicling events and relating facts to a more personal expression that still included the reporting of events, but with personal affairs becoming more and more prominent.

Tourism is one of the world's fastest growing industries and a large to almost sole source of income for a number of countries.

Like many forms of development, tourism is the cause of problems such as economic dependencies, ecological degradation, loss of cultural heritage and social issues. Ironically the natural environment that tourism in many instances relies on is also destroyed by tourism.

2020 has been the year in which, due to COVID-19’s travel bans and restrictions, many countries are struggling financially and the tourism industry has been hit extremely hard. Yet, undeniably, it has also had a positive impact on natural landscapes, resulting in cleaner waters and bringing back certain species to certain areas.

Increasingly, people are becoming aware of their contribution to some of the negative impact on the places they visit and are looking for more responsible holidays. This is where sustainable tourism has really started to shine.

Tourism that takes full account of its current and future economic, social and environmental impacts, addressing the needs of visitors, the industry, the environment and host communities

World Tourism Organisation

In essence, sustainable tourism should help in conserving natural heritage and biodiversity by making use of environmental resources.

It should also respect the host communities' socio-cultural authenticity in conserving their cultural heritage, traditional values and contribute to cultural understanding and lack of prejudice. It needs to secure long-term economic functions, fair distribution of socio-economic benefits to all stakeholders (communities, tourists, NGOs, governments, employees, suppliers, education, small businesses, transport etc), stable employment and job opportunities, as well as contribute to the reduction of poverty.

Some examples of the impact of tourism when not operated sustainably in Europe are:

These are but a few of a growing number of problems that affect a high number of European cities and natural landmarks as well as many other places around the world.

Due to these environmental, social and economic dependency concerns, some countries and organisations have implemented sustainable tourism methods in certain cities or areas.

Within Europe,Sloveniahas one of the best protected natural habitats in the world and takes great care of its biodiversity. Many of the hotels in Ljubljana offer electric scooters as well as green food in order to reduce the environmental impact.

The Eden Projectin Cornwall is an educational charity that demonstrates the importance of plants to people and the vital intertwined relationship between the two.

Between 2017 and 2020, Finland has invested millions of euros into developing sustainable tourism in Lapland and has anextensive guide on their websiteon how to travel responsibly with lists of sustainable hotels and activities.

Many other places across Europe are paying more attention to the needs of their locals and their environment whilst still wanting to find a healthier balance with tourism.  For this to work and be sustainable, three pillars of impact need to be implemented: economic, social and environmental impact.

These days, with a quick online search, it is extremely easy to find out which places nearby and overseas offer sustainable tourism, and how you can be more mindful of your impact on locals and the environment you plan to visit.

The effect of war

Competing systems – arbitrary or alphabetical signs?

Embossed type in Scotland

The rise of Braille

In the nineteenth century innovations in raised type allowed  the written word to became accessible to visually impaired readers for the first time.

In the nineteenth century innovations in raised type allowed printers to create embossed texts that could be read through touch. For the first time the written word became accessible to readers with blindness and visual impairment.

It was only in the late eighteenth century that education for the blind began to include literacy as well as vocational skills.  At the Royal Institute for Blind Youths in ParisValentin Haüyexperimented with embossed plates and wet paper and produced the first tactile text in 1786.

Haüy’s experiments were hindered by the French Revolution but the Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815) revived interest in embossed printing.Charles Barbier, an officer in Napoleon’s army, had invented a writing system of raised dots to help armies communicate in the dark. War left many soldiers with visual impairments caused by injury and disease. Barbier realised that his 'night writing' could help them, and many others with similar impairments, to read. In 1821 he presented it at the National Institute for Blind Youths in Paris. One audience member was a young Louis Braille, who would become the father of tactile type as we know it today.

The road to braille was not straightforward andseveral competing typesappeared in first half of the nineteenth century. Should the raised letters reflect the alphabet or should abstract symbols be used instead? There were arguments for both sides:

The first embossed type in Britain was the 'triangular alphabet' designed by James Gall, a founder of the Royal Blind School in Edinburgh. Gall made the letters out of angular lines so that they could be understood by blind and sighted people alike. Gall claimed that his students could read slowly after only an hour’s practice but he made little progress outside Edinburgh.

In 1832 The Society of Arts for Scotland held a competition for the best embossed type. There were 15 entries but Edmund Fry’s alphabetical system of roman capitals triumphed. Shortly afterwards John Alston began printing at the Glasgow Asylum for the Blind using a slightly modified version of Fry’s design. 'Alston type' proved popular and inspired similar forms across Europe and North America.

In Paris, Louis Braille had adapted Barbier’s designs so that each symbol could be recognised with one fingertip. In 1829 he published the first braille alphabet. It was popular with students at the National Institute but was not officially adopted there until 1854.

In Britain, braille was even slower to take hold but campaigners likeThomas Rhodes Armitageand the British and Foreign Blind Association were gaining influence. Armitage insisted that:

the question must not be settledforthe blind, butby the blind themselves.

By 1870 the existing systems had been tested and the BFBA judges (all blind themselves) concluded that braille was the best. There were still many years and revisions to go but the reign of alphabetical embossed type was over. In 1882 Armitage announced that outside North America 'there is now probably no institution in the civilized world where braille is not used.'

Today braille is instantly recognisable as the writing system used by the blind and visually impaired.

Holidays that preserve rural communities

Agriturismo involves bringing visitors to a place used primarily for agricultural purposes. The history of agriturismo in Italy began in 1965. In 1973, the official agriturismo farmhouse designation was created so tourists could stay on farms and learn from farmers about rural life.

Agriturismo started as an effort to stop people moving away from rural villages after World War II, since the country was withdrawing from its rural past.

Due to some areas having low amounts of arable land and due to high costs of labour in European countries, it can still be difficult for families to stay on farm lands handed down to them through generations.

EU member states have enhanced their national policies to encourage agriturismo as a method to revive rural areas by diversifying the country’s tourism sector, increasing farm income and creating jobs in rural communities.

Italy’s agriturismo is heavily regulated and somewhat restricted due to concerns of hotel and restaurant sectors. Farmers can provide one of three levels of services: snacks and light meals, full course meals or farm holidays which includes meals, accommodation as well as recreational activities. Farmers providing farm holidays can have a maximum of 30 guests per night for up to 160 days a year.

In certain regions, farmers need a license to take part in Agriturismo, which includes things like courses in law, hospitality, financial accounting, hygiene and sanitation.

Eating and sharing meals plays an important social role in Italy, so the link between agriturismo and local produce continues to attract consumers interested in an alternative touristic experience where they receive more information about the food they consume, the environmental impact and animal welfare.

Because of Agritourism, the Italian countryside has been able to save a significant number of valuable historic farm buildings and preserve traditional agriculture.

Documenting changes in a Swedish province's rich cultural and natural heritage in the 20th century

Having grown up in the Swedish province Hälsingland, the photographer Hilding Mickelsson spent his life documenting the region’s rich cultural and natural heritage. In his work, we see how landscapes and the built environment change gradually in the 20th century.



His photographs capture the strong connection of the artist to his home region and his mission to preserve and promote its heritage.

The 20th century transformed rural Sweden. Economic development and agricultural politics changed daily life. People started working in industries, farms grew bigger and artificial fertilisers began to have an increasing impact on the environment.

In the 1950s and 1960s, awareness of environmental or climate issues was not common at all -  especially in small villages, where farmers were dependent on growing revenues.

However, farmer’s son Hilding Mickelsson spoke up. He engaged in discussions in newspapers about local factories polluting the water. His early active engagement for the environment created tensions in his hometown. However, his most important medium was not his words - it was his photographs.

Hilding Mickelsson, born in 1919 in Ollas, Sweden, had a close relationship to his home region Hälsingland his whole life. His father, a hunter, took him out into the forest regularly from the age of three and taught him how to mimic birds. Mickelsson later said: ‘You are never lonely in the forest. There’s always something new to learn or something you’ve never seen before.’

He began taking photographs in 1934, the start of a lifelong passion and career.

Hälsingland is the common theme in his more than 150,000 photographs. He captures how he perceives his environment: holistically. He does not separate or favour the material over the intangible, nor nature over culture.

When you look at his images of hundreds of historical farmhouses,the hälsingegårdar, you could get the impression that he sought to document them. He systematically explored the region’s villages by bicycle, talked to the people living there, and even moved furniture to explore hidden relics of the richly decorated wooden walls that are typical for the region.

His photographs are in many cases the only evidence left about these _Hälsingemålning_ar, examples for a specific style of painting. Hilding Mickelsson had a specific perspective, an artistic gaze that lifts his photographs above merely documenting.

His mission was not only to document the traditional arts and craft. In the 1960s, many of these historical buildings were torn down as people wanted modern houses. They wanted to exchange the old and traditional for the practical and new.

By taking photographs of the farmhouses and their rich interiors, Mickelsson wanted to preserve them and raise awareness for the value of Hälsingland’s heritage and built environment. He travelled Sweden to show others the specific techniques and patterns – also to persuade the people back home of the importance of preserving what they perceived as worthless.

How important his relationship and his knowledge about his home region are for his artistic work becomes evident in one of the recurring topics: birds.

He would leave in the morning with his camera, and vanish into the woods for days or weeks, waiting for the right moment to capture the beauty of these birds. He could mimic them so well that they let him come closer than usual. As he says, ‘it takes 90% patience and 10% camera skills’.

Two of his most famous works focus on owls. LIFE magazine featured ‘The great grey owl attacks’ on its front cover in the 1960s. Hilding Mickelsson took it when he and a friend were ringing birds in the forest. The circumstances were quite dangerous, as the owl wanted to protect her chicks. Another famous photo series has two small protagonists: a small owl and a kitten, growing up together in his family’s yard.

His family was an important part of his work, enabling him to follow his passion as he did. His wife Adéle especially supported him wherever she could. Their son Olle described their partnership later: ‘Without her, my father could have never been the person he was.’

Hilding Mickelsson was more than a photographer.

He perceived his environment, both culture and nature, as a whole and transformed it into art. ‘Art means learning to really see’, as he described it. He raised awareness for the specific value of the built environment and art in Hälsingland through his photographs, travels and books.

Furthermore, he saw common ground in nature and culture, the immaterial practices and material relics. Due to his close connection to his home region, he was aware of the changes and warned of negative impacts, no matter what consequences it had for himself.

Known as ‘Camera Mickel’ to his friends, Mickelsson took one of his last photographs in 1999, three years before his death. It depicts a rainbow over his red farmhouse in Hälsingland, with the forest in the background - nature and culture combined.

Edward Williams (Iolo Morganwg)

The invention of a tradition - Gorsedd of the Bards of the Isles of Britain

James Macpherson – translator or forger?

The romantic legacy of Morganwg and Macpherson

Learn about literary forgeries in 18th century poetry celebrating Celtic cultures in Scotland and Wales.

Romanticismbreathed new life into late 18th-century European literature as it emphasized the importance of expression and individuality.

Poetry and song were used to celebrate Celtic cultures in Scotland and Wales and literary myth-making fostered a new sense of identity amongst indigenous cultures.

Edward Williams, better known by his bardic name Iolo Morganwg, was a Welsh historian and antiquarian. He is still the most controversial writer in Welsh history.

Ink and wash portrait drawing ofIolo Morganwg, ‘Bardd Braint a Defod’, (ca. 1800), National Library of Wales. Public Domain.

He was an accomplished Celtic scholar and poet who epitomised Romanticism. Coupling knowledge with an innovative instinct, he combined past and present culture with fabrications to develop a powerful new concept of Welshness.

Iolo presented the Welsh as the most important people in Britain and the earliest defenders of the Celtic world against Roman invaders. He ‘revived’ a Druidic circle calledGorsedd of the Bards of the Isles of Britainto promote and enrich Wales’s cultural heritage. The Gorsedd became Welsh poetry’s court of law, training poets in their craft, and regulating the order of Welsh poetry.

The Gorsedd first met in London in 1792 and solidified its position in Carmarthen in 1819 where it became associated with theeisteddfodicinstitution.

The Ossian cycle is one of the most significant literary forgeries of all time.James Macpherson’s epic poems were hugely popular but his claims that they were translations of Gaelic verse by a 3rd-century bard called Ossian caused immediate controversy.

As gross an imposition as ever the world was troubled with.

Dr Samuel Johnson

Many challenged the authenticity of the poems, especially Dr Samuel Johnson who in hisJourney to the Western Islands of Scotlandcalled Macpherson a fraud. Macpherson was so outraged that he even challenged Johnson to a duel!

Macpherson denied that he had invented most of his translations but he repeatedly failed to produce the original manuscripts. Some of the poems have roots in genuine Gaelic manuscripts like theBook of the Dean of Lismorebut it is widely accepted that they are largely fabricated.

It was only after Macpherson’s death in 1826 that scholars discovered that many of Iolo’s findings were also forgeries, but despite the controversies the work of both men had a profound cultural impact.

Iolo’s influence is still evident in the opulent Gorsedd ceremonies, which are an integral part of the annualNational Eisteddfod of Wales. Today he is a legendary figure in his own right.

The ‘chairing’ of the winning bard was an integral part of Iolo’s Gorsedd ceremonies. This illustration can be found in “The Royal National Eisteddfod of Wales, Corwen” events’ programme (1919), p. 210. Copyright: Eisteddfod Genedlaethol Cymru.

_Ossian_’s romanticised vision of Scotland shaped the way people imagined its landscapes and inhabitants. Translations in a dozen languages stimulated national revivals and inspired art, literature and music across Europe.

Morganwg and Macpherson sparked fresh interest in native Celtic cultures that survived all accusations of forgery. Their mythical works helped define the Romantic Movement and continue to inspire ideas about national identity.

Discover the history of a modern dance theatre that helped propel stories of a nation to the world

The Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre has gained worldwide recognition from its origins as a small, all-Black dance theatre.

It was founded in 1958 by dancer and choreographer Alvin Ailey (1931-1981) who wanted to create a space for Black dancers, who oftentimes were at the forefront of discrimination. In its early stages, it consisted of seven dancers. By 1963, Ailey began to expand the dance company to a multi-racial group to counter the secludedness he felt he had created while trying to be inclusive of ethnic minorities.

The company performances were focused on Black experiences - 'sometimes sorrowful, sometimes jubilant, but always hopeful' - with unique interpretations of gospel music and original music compositions like 'The River' by Duke Ellington which Ailey and Ellington collaborated closely on for the choreography (of the same name).

In 1960, Ailey produced 'Revelations' which became a hit as a signature work for The Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre company.

The piece displays the history, beliefs and traditions of African-American culture while also telling the story of perseverance from slavery to freedom through dance placed to gospels, spirituals and blues music. It has been performed at the White House several times and was also part of the opening ceremony of the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City.

They started their first international tours in the 1960s. In1966, the company performed at the first World Festival of Black Arts in Dakar, Senegal alongside participants such as writers Aimé Césaire and Amiri Baraka.

Their hit tour of Russia in the 1970s was broadcast to over 22 million viewers and, on their closing night, the audience's continuous clapping led to over 30 curtain calls.  This led them to selling out shows on their return to the US, making the company a tremendous success.

In 1971, Judith Jamison, a dancer and Ailey’s muse, premiered 'Cry' Ailey's signature ballet solo dedicated to his mother as a birthday present and to all Black women everywhere. The piece takes its audiences on a journey of sorrow, cruel hardship and joy.

'In those days, none of us could shop at Tiffany or Bloomingdales, so Alvin decided the nicest present he could give his mother was a ballet.'Judith Jamison

The dance company has been a safe haven for a lot of Black dancers of all sexual orientations. Alvin Ailey himself was gay during a time when being gay was even less accepted in the Black community, thus he was extremely private about his personal life. Before his death on 1 December 1989, from an AIDS-related illness, he had asked Judith Jamison to take over as artistic director.

In August 2019, Ailey was honoured in the Rainbow Honor Walk in San Francisco noting LGBTQ people who have made significant contributions in their fields.

Ailey had always insisted that the company perform choreographies other than his own pieces and, to this day, the Alvin Ailey Dance Theatre continues Ailey’s legacy by performing important works of the past and continuing to commission new ones.

One of the most successful female impersonators in the early 20th century

'Every man can learn the art of being a beautiful woman,' said John Lind, one of the most successful female impersonators in the early 20th century. He became one of Sweden’s most famous stars in international show business, playing effortlessly with society’s norms about gender and sex.

Coming from a small town in Sweden, John Lind advanced to a regular guest on stages across the world, from the Moulin Rouge in Paris and the Colosseum in London to the Broadway in New York. This career in the performing arts made him - born as John Lindström in Vissefjärda in 1877 - an early 20th century star, touring across Europe, the Americas and Africa.

John Lind was attracted to standing on stage and performing for his audience for his entire life.

Growing up and going to school in Karlskrona, he organised and took part in theatre plays. His group soon earned some money with entrance fees. When a theatre director travelled through Karlskrona saw him performing, she recommended him to the Tivoli in Stockholm.

When he left Karlskrona, at the age of 17, the local newspaper wrote: ‘Already as a young boy, L. has shown great attraction to the theatre and has performed successfully with several performances... Lindström is now planning to travel to the capital to become a stage artist, a career for which he seems to have a natural talent and invincible passion.’

This is how John Lind himself described his first time in Stockholm in 1895:

'At the Alhambra I danced both as a boy and a girl. But I was so nervous when I was standing on stage in the skirts, that my ballet master had to stand behind the curtain, next to the stage and show me the different figures. Right next to the Alhambra was Kristallsalongen, where they also had ballets and the like. One evening, a girl in the ballet got sick, people came rushing in and asked me to stand in, and before I even realized it, I was there. And then I became seriously involved with ballet. No one in the audience thought that not everyone on stage was a girl.'

He was later part of a duo, known as Fanny and John Lind, and performed both in female and male roles.

In 1896, the newspaper Hvad Nytt in Stockholm wrote about the two:'From the dance duet Fanny and John Lind, I recognise the latter, since he danced into everyone's hearts at Tivoli last year. The boy was then the most beautiful of all the ballet girls. God certainly made a mistake when he made John Lind a boy...'

The theatre and ballet scene in Stockholm started to notice his talent and people persuaded him to study ballet professionally.

At the same time, he danced and sang in revues and variety shows, mostly in female roles. However, in 1896, shows like these were forbidden. He was invited to Helsinki, Finland, to train with a ballet master and tour with a group through Finland and Russia. One of the institutions where he performed was the Swedish Theatre in Helsinki. He later travelled to Germany, where he worked together with Paul Schneider-Dunker and learned to sing as a soprano.

In the last decade of the 19th century, John Lind’s career took off and he started touring all across Europe. Because of his hard training and skilled performances, the audience often did not realise that he was not the girl they thought he was:

'At that time, no one knew I was a boy, everyone thought I was a girl. In Kronstadt, all the officers ran down right after my performance, grabbed me and lifted me up. Of course, I was terrified, but above all, I kept my hands on my wig so that it would not fall off and reveal me. If they had known the truth, they would have certainly beat me up.'

He shared several stories which reveal the dangers that he as an artist experienced because of the lack of understanding and acceptance in society.

The years 1902 and 1903 were especially busy for John Lind.

He toured in Italy, Spain, France, Hungary, Austria, Switzerland and the Netherlands, and spent more than a year in Great Britain, where he performed on several stages in London. He could have become a British citizen but decided to stay Swedish - although he was denied the popularity and success in his home country that he experienced in many other places around the world.

He became especially famous in the US where he debuted in Chicago and toured along the East Coast. When he came to New York and performed at the Hammerstein’s Theatre, he met his future wife, Stephanie. She went on travelling the world with him, tailored his dresses and supported him to get into the shape needed for his performances. He had a detailed beauty regime, and it was she who helped him with his make-up, skincare and even developed a method to remove his leg hair regularly.

His shows soon became legendary, multisensory experiences for his audiences. He developed techniques to impress crowds with scents, light effects, mirrors and incorporated both taste and sounds in his shows.

John Lind paid a price for his life on stage. Due to his extensive travels, the strict beauty regime, and the corset he wore that bound his waist from 95cm to 55cm, he suffered from several diseases in his late years. He described the pain of his performances:

'My work was often very tiring. The wig was pinching my head, the shoes were several numbers too small and the corset tight. With all those things torturing me, I had to dance, sing and look happy - but when I won the applause, I forgot all the pain and tiredness.'

After a trip to Buenos Aires, he and his wife decided to return to Sweden to live in Karlskrona. John and Stephanie bought a house and stayed there for the rest of their lives. After John’s death in 1940, Stephanie lived alone until the 1970s. Although John tried to perform in Sweden, the Swedish audience did not accept his art and he only made a few appearances.

Although John Lind described himself as a female impersonator and dancer, his legacy later inspired drag queens around the world, such as Danny La Rue. In the international community, he is still counted among the most famous Swedes - while being almost forgotten in his home country.

Discover the favourite reading material of monoglot Welsh speakers right from the 17th century.

Almanacswere the favourite reading material of monoglot Welsh speakers right from the 17th century!

Affordable literatures, such as the almanac, were particularly popular with the lower classes, which made up most of Wales’s population. Between c. 1545 and 1801, the population of Wales saw a staggering increase - in fact, it more than doubled. Most of these people were monoglot Welsh speakers.

But what exactly is analmanac, and what made it such a favourite?

The defining feature of an almanac is itsannual calendar, and in this sense, its history predates the printing press by several millennia. The near East produced texts considered to be almanacs as long ago as 500 B.C. However, it was only after the development of printing that almanacs truly began to gain popularity.

The first printed almanac was produced in Europe in 1457. Yearly almanacs were printed in England from the late 16th century and these became bestsellers during the succeeding century. The first Welsh-language almanac was soon to follow.

It is withThomas Jones(1648-1713), a tailor’s son from Tre’r Ddôl near Corwen, that the story of the Welsh almanac begins.

In 1679, when he was eighteen, Jones was granted a royal patent for writing and publishing an annual Welsh-language almanac. These were published in London, under the title ‘Newyddion Oddiwrth y Sêr’ (‘News From the Stars’).

Jones’ almanacs were between 20 and 24 leaves in length. They contained, along with the typical yearly calendar, material that was directed at their intended readership.

The first Welsh almanacs featured:

Jones’ almanacs were useful resources for the poor Welsh, particularlyfarmers; consider, for example, their environmental and weather related content.Astrological featuresalso fulfilled the folk’s superstitious beliefs. Jones was a known supporter of amateur Welsh writers and he gave them a printed platform through his almanac.

Thomas Jones’ almanac remained one of a kind until 1695, when thePrinting Act(which had restricted book-publishing to London, Oxford and Cambridge) came to an end. From then on, the printing industry spread throughout England and Wales, resulting in an increase in the number of Welsh almanac titles. Their contents, however, strayed little from Jones’ original format.

The Welsh almanac stands apart from its European cousins. Their contents varied from the medical lore of England’s medieval almanacs to the administrative organisation of France; as featured in the French ‘Royal Almanac’, founded in 1683. That the Italian ‘Barbanera’ (first published in 1762) is today included inUNESCO’s ‘Memory of the World’Registergives a clear indication of an almanac’s value.

The Welsh almanac is certainly no exception. It is a valuable resource, not only in terms ofliterary, vernacular, and social history, but also as a work of greatheritagesignificance.

Is utopia the best possible place possible or possible at all? Is one person's utopia another's dystopia?

Today we often hear the words utopia and dystopia used in informal conversations and in the media. But what do these words really mean? To find out, let's trace the ideas behind utopia and dystopia through the history of literature and thought.

Utopia(from the Greek for ‘no place’ or the good place’) was coined for the first time in 1516 by the English philosopher and lawyerSir Thomas More.

Published by his close friend Erasmus of Rotterdam, another famous humanist, More's novelUtopiais ‘a little, true book, not less beneficial than enjoyable, about how things should be in the new island Utopia’. In fact, it is a satire describing a fictional island’s social and religious structure, which interestingly includes slavery as an unavoidable consequence of its functioning. Influenced by the discovery of the new continent by Columbus and the possibilities for the foundation of a new world order (which resulted in one of the most horrific genocides and the beginning of European colonialism), the book gave rise to a literary genre which features ideal places and well-organised societies.

Some of the classical examples are theNew Atlantis(Francis Bacon),Erewhon(Samuel Butler), orCandide(Voltaire).

In the 18th century, the French Revolution and its American counterpart brought the idea of universal rights and the need for political and social transformation to the utopian movement.

But it was during the 19th century, a prolific period for philosophical and technological changes due to industrialisation and great advances in science (Darwinism, railroads, telegraphs), that utopian literature as a genre started to flourish. Movements against slavery and for women's rights began to be prominent.

Regardless of these scientific and humanist advances, the society of that time remained one of great social injustice and economic inequality. Thinkers and philosophers were interested in how the extreme labour conditions of the emerging working class could be improved.  Debates emerged about how to implement the ideas of utopian socialists like Charles Fourier, Étienne Cabet, Robert Owen or William Morris.

The textile designer, poet, novelist, translator and socialist activist, William Morris was deeply concerned with environmental degradation and overpopulation in cities.

Unlike the utopians, Karl Marx - the most important figure for socialism - advocated for a more egalitarian, communal, and meritocratic world using science and technology as driving forces.

At the end of the 19th century, Marx as well as author H. G. Wells were able to imagine the huge impact of new scientific developments for future societies, and thus ignited a turning point for utopian literature: the beginning of science fiction.

H.G. Wells and Jules Verne are considered among the fathers of the science fiction genre. Wells was an exceptional writer who was nominated 4 times for the Nobel Prize. His novels foresaw some of the breakthroughs of our modern society like space travel, nuclear weapons, satellite television, and the World Wide Web.



Jules Verne Magasinet. 1973. Jamtli. CC BY-NC-ND. 1973

Wells was also interested in biological engineering, particularly eugenics, controversial practices of that period that inspired some of the Nazi's racial policies and experiments.The Time Machine(1895),The Island of Doctor Moreau(1896) andA Modern Utopia(1905) are the best examples of his imaginary future world.

In his novelTime Machine(spoiler alert), set in the futuristic world of Elois and Morlocks, Wells suggests that by creating a utopia for some, we may subjugate others to live in a dystopia.

This reflection – which has been shared since in many books and films (for example:Blade Runner, Matrix, The Truman Show) – brings us to some crucial questions: ‘Is there a real chance for the betterment of humankind and the design of fairer and more equal society? Are we condemned to live perpetually in the ‘best’ place possible? Do we live in a utopia for a few or a dystopia for many? And very pertinent now, are technology and science a positive or a negative enabler?'

A different chapter in the utopian genre is represented by feminist utopia, which is especially concerned with the role of women in the power dynamics of a patriarchal society.

Charlotte Perkins Gilman and Lady Florence Dixie were important authors in the early movement at the end of the 19th century. Both have influenced the work of more contemporary writers like Margaret Atwood and her popular book and (later) television seriesThe Handmaid’s Tale.

The 1950s marked another crucial moment of the genre with what scholars consider the ‘dystopian turn’. The world then was divided into two geopolitical areas and the threat of a nuclear war, but at the same time has started to experience the pleasure and immediate rewards of consumerism. Many artists, philosophers, writers, politicians, and thinkers are beginning to debate overpopulation and environmental devastation.

Aldous Huxley’sBrave New World(1932) and George Orwell’sNineteen Eighty-Four(1949) are two well-known examples of dystopian literature.

Orwell based his novel on the experience of communist dictatorships and repression. Huxley understood that in the future, the control of the state and other hegemonic forces were going to be deployed through leisure and entertainment, instead of violence and censorship. He envisaged the reality we currently live in, where we all gladly exchange freedom for security and we ignore the truth to live in our happy bubble or ‘utopian island’.

Tracing the development of tourism from the 17th century to the present-day

People have always had a need to travel, be it to explore and discover new lands or for our own enjoyment. Tourism covers precisely the latter.

We can trace the origin of the modern concept oftourismback to the 17th century, when young nobles from western and northern European countries made what was called the Grand Tour - a trip around Europe (usually coveringFrance,Germany,ItalyandGreecewith the main purpose of soaking up history, art and cultural heritage. It was considered a perfect way to be educated.

By the 18th century, this custom was widespread among wealthier classes and it spread to other parts of the world, such as America. Similarly, religious pilgrimages that were already popular during the Middle Ages continued during this period.

The Industrial Revolution, which began in the second half of the 18th century, produced a major economic, social and technological transformation that would spread to the rest of the world. As a result of these changes, there was an exodus from rural regions to growing big cities, which needed labour for the new industry.

Therefore, new social classes appeared. Developments in transport were also key.

The improvements in freight and passenger transport contributed to the birth of leisure, new forms of entertainment and travel. People travelled mainly by train, taking advantage of the fact that railway networks connected the destinations in Europe and other parts of the world.

The 19th century saw the creation of the first travel agencies. One of the pioneers was Thomas Cook & Son, which was the first to offer excursions and holidays for groups, which included transport, accommodation and food tickets, thus making costs cheaper.

This would be the origin of what we now know as package holidays.

In the first half of the20th century, the tourism industry continued to grow thanks to the mass production of buses and cars.

Coastal tourism began to gain importance and, afterWorld War II, the Mediterranean coast quickly grew in popularity. Also, improvements in air transport (charter flights) as well as progress in labour legislation and a growth in social welfare led to a boom in tourism.

The tourism sector transformed during a recession during the 1970s, mainly due to the energy crisis which led to lower costs and prices. That's when mass tourism emerged. Travelling went from being something only for an exclusive group to become a leisure activity within the reach of many.

In the following decades, there was a progressive internationalisation of hotel companies, travel agencies and airlines. New products and new leisure activities were also offered, revolving around sports and health, among others.

Today, the tourism sector has become one of the great economic engines in many countries, forming part of the international political agenda.

In recent years, with low-cost flights and the existence of alternative accommodations, managed by online companies, it is much easier for tourists to afford to travel and they can design their itinerary and experiences to their liking.

Tourism not only impacts the local economy, but it is also starting to affect the social structures, culture and lifestyle of the destinations visited. Therefore, the challenge now is to provide solutions by developing a tourism awareness that is respectful with the environment and the local way of living of its inhabitants.

Yugoslavia’s avant-garde invented a new language and orthography in the early 20th century.

Yugoslavia’s avant-garde invented a new language and orthography in the early 20th century! The movement was at the forefront of the aesthetic revolution of the time and  demanded an aesthetic re-evaluation of the world. This was kick-started in Zurich in 1916 with the appearance of the art form Dadaism as a reaction to the civic aesthetic forms of pre-war art and literature.

Early avant-garde periodicals in Yugoslavia were related to the cultural climate of post-war Zagreb and Belgrade.Zenit (Zenith)magazine (1921-1926) was launched in Zagreb by the avant-garde artist Ljubomir Micić (1895–1971). In 1926 it was banned and the editor was forced to go into exile.

Adopting the basic postulates of the European avant-garde, Ljubomir Micić founded an authentic Yugoslav avant-garde movement calledZenitizam(Zenithism).This represented a unique blend of Russian Futurism, German Expressionism, Dada and anti-Dada with traces of Balkan Luddism. It was reflected in the figure ofBarbarogenius, whose purpose was to decivilize Europe and pave the way for new values.

Other avantgarde periodicals includeDada Tank(1922) andDada Jazz(1922), published by the avant-garde artist Dragan Aleksić (1901–1958) andDada Jok(1922), edited by Branko Ve Poljanski (1898–1947).

A unique blend of poetry and pictures, signs and their negations, different scripts and languages, as well as poetry, painting and architecture marked the artistic concept of the magazine. Issue 5 ofZenit(5 June 1921) containedZenitistisches Manifest, written in German by the French-German poet Iwan Goll (1891-1950). TheManifestointroduced the quest for theNew Manand abolished the division of people into nations with the exclamation:We are all Europeans, Americans, Africans, Asians and Australians!

The examples have been selected from the tradition of historical avant-garde. At the beginning of the 20th century, this movement was still not clearly defined but merely followed the postulates of radical negation, confrontation with tradition and the establishment of a new connection between signs and images.

Traditional games have played a part of Portuguese children’s education for generations, a valuable part of cultural and social heritage.

Throughout its history, sport in Portugal has seen several influences, mainly based on militarism, gymnastics and health.

Due to the dictatorship in Portugal up until 1974, sport underwent several changes - both political and social. At the time, Mocidade Portuguesa - Portuguese youth organisations with a military character - were intended to separate children, younger men and women to not allow interaction between them. Currently in Portugal, this no longer happens with children of all ages and genders involved in sport.

Traditional Portuguese games play a fundamental role in children's lives. They were designed so that children playing them will develop skills, such as: cooperating in game play, following guidelines and rules, mastering movements and gaining knowledge of how games are won and lost.

By playing traditional games, children also develop physical, intellectual, emotional and affective skills.

There are several traditional games in Portugal, including Cat and Mouse, Target Shooting, Elastic Jumping, Bag Racing, Blind Goat.

In The Blind Goat game, one of the players is designated as the ‘blind goat’ - blindfolded and trying to catch the other players who are in a circle around the goat. The player caught by the goat then becomes the ‘blind goat’.

Other traditional games that are also very popular in Portugal are the Toothpick game, Handkerchief game, skipping rope game, hoop game, the Rooster, spoon With potato, game of chairs, rope in the line, game of mesh.

In the game of mesh, players throwing metal discs or stones towards a pin or a stick placed at a certain distance, aiming to  knock over the pin or land the discs as close as possible to it. It is a traditional game widely played in several towns in Portugal, either with two players competing against each other or with double (two against two) or larger teams.

Traditional games are part of the first cycle of basic education in Portugal, taught in Physical Education classes. Lessons are designed to make students aware of the importance of the learning process, as well as of the knowledge of the playful culture of their parents' generation.

These lessons are important in providing students with knowledge of game types, fundamental so they better understand their national game culture. In this sense, traditional games promote physical and cultural learning, as well as encouraging the students to work in teams.

Throughout the world - not solely in Portugal - traditional games should always be present in children's learning, because in addition to promoting their physical, psychological and social development, they provide moments of fun.

For these reasons, playing games is beneficial and contributes to improving both children and adults’ well-being and quality of life. Traditional games are thus shared from generation to generation, as they carry a valuable cultural and social heritage that must be preserved, valuing the past and building a better future - despite the political and social changes that can occur over time.

Spas and wellness resorts in the 20th Century

The healing power and beneficial effects of water have been known since prehistoric times. The emergence of spa resorts at locations giving access to river-, lake- or seawater rich in minerals is directly related to this belief. An important part of today’s wellness industry is taken up by wellness resorts boasting a wide range of facilities and treatments involving water. These kinds of resorts boomed in popularity throughout the previous century.

While drinking and bathing in source and sea water have been common practices for many centuries, dedicated spa resorts centered around water wellness only started to emerge in the 18th century. By the early 20th century, spas were equipped to cater for a complete wellness experience.

Apart from complex bathing procedures resort guests were often offered to follow a strict diet, or were even required to follow one. These diets often made the most of the beneficial qualities of the  locally sourced water these resorts were built around.

The mud acquired at the resort location was also put to good use: covering the body with mud allowed for its thermal, mechanical and chemical effects to fully exert its beneficial effects.

European Jewry contributed to the medical, economic and cultural development of the spa and spa culture in Europe. Popular centers for the Jewish bourgeoisie in the beginning of the twentieth century included resorts, such asKarlsbad (Karlove Vary),Marienbad (Mariánské Lázně)andFranzesbad (Františkovy Lázně).

Spas were places to be seen and became an important space for socializing and culture in the twentieth century. In 1911, the authorSholem Aleichempreserved this spa culture in one of his last booksMarienbad, which lampoonsPolish Jewssummering at wellness resorts.

Where thermal spas sprung up around naturally occurring water sources, the popularity of spas resulted in wellness centers opening up in the 1970s in locations without a natural healing spring. These wellness resorts would still offer a wide range of treatments and water-related facilities, such as saunas.

Pioneering countries such as Finland and the Baltic States helped to popularize sauna culture all across Europe. From the 1940s onwards, soldiers who had fought alongside the Finnish during theContinuation Wartook the custom home with them.

Modern wellness centers take the basic principles of hydro- andbalneotherapyto an unprecedented level. Today, these centers provide not only baths, therapeutic treatments and saunas, but a plethora of other facilities:contrast baths, wave pools, hot tubs,hammamsandfloating tanks- both challenging the body and relaxing the mind.

From the very start of the 20th century, nutrition was considered as essential to well-being as physical exercise, with food being seen as a key to good health.

From the very start of the 20th century, nutrition was considered as essential to well-being as physical exercise, with food being seen as a key to good health. While experts have generally agreed that the main dietary guideline should be ‘moderation in all things’, throughout the century more radical approaches resulted in a wide variety of diets.

In America, since the 1860s,John Harvey Kellogghad been stressing the importance of a healthy diet in his Michigan sanitarium. About three decades later, while experimenting to develop a soft breakfast product, he unintentionally ended up with crispy ‘granose’ cereals, later remarketed as ‘Sanitas Toasted Corn Flakes’. The invention of Corn Flakes marked the start of a dietary rage that would go on to take Europe by storm.

In the 1920s, doctors prescribed cigarettes to overweight patients, advising them to smoke when the urge to eat set in. In the 1960s, Robert Cameron devised an alcohol diet requiring drinks to be consumed with every meal, and, in 1975, Sanford Siegal developed a regime based on eating six cookies a day.

A popular formula that grew into a global movement is that ofWeight Watchers: a variant of the 1950s ‘Prudent Diet’ based on regularity of food intake, weighing of portions and healthy food choices.

Inventor and New York housewife Jean Nideth added the elements of group support, a reward system for accomplishing milestones and regular weigh-in sessions to the existing dietary plan. By the end of the 1970s, Weight Watchers International Inc. had become a thriving business which was sold to the Heinz Company for 72 million dollars.

More questionable shortcuts to a healthy lifestyle are the pills, potions and food supplements claiming to offer an easy answer to issues of wellbeing. In the early years of the 20th century, a tapeworm in pill form was advertised as a miracle cure, allowing people to eat more while still losing weight.

Strychnia (commonly known asstrychnine) is definitely not a sensible option, but at the beginning of the 20th century the poisonous substance was the crux of the sales pitch of this tonic promising to aid digestion.

Tonic and elixir advertisements could claim - without any real proof - to relieve any range of illnesses and discomfort: from colds and chest pains to nervousness, sleeplessness, as well as  loss of appetite and ensuring a safe birth and decrease in labour pains.

As formal medicine testing and a crackdown on advertising false medical claims became more widespread, medicinal quackery slowly died out as the 20th Century progressed.

Selling products that promise increased health is far from over, however. In the end, the adage put forward by health experts in the last century still rings true: moderation in all things, variation, and a balanced diet.

Roots

A toned body, an agile mind and tons of energy: who wouldn’t sign up for that? A state of complete contentment - ‘eudaimonia’ as the ancient Greeks called it, or ‘wellness’ as it’s been known since the 1950s - has been at the pinnacle of human aspirations for many centuries.

From the early 1900s onwards, this very ambition began to spin a billion dollar industry, offering services, facilities and products to the health-conscious consumer. In this blog we revisit revolutionary 20th-century ideas to bolster physical fitness and a fit physique.



Search the internet for ‘wellness’ and 859 million sites offer to guide you to a world of bliss. Whereas the term became mainstream only in the late 20th century, the concept is as old as humanity.

Thousands of years ago, Chinese traditional medicine aimed at addressing aspects of both physical and mental health. In Ancient Rome and Greece too, it was the norm for men as well as women to frequent gymnasiums and take care of their body as a prerequisite for sanity of mind.

In the Middle Ages, Sephardic Jewish philosopher Moses ben Maimon - commonly known asMaimonides- explicitly championed physical activity as a means to achieve ‘genuine wholeness’, or knowledge of God. Taking care of the body was regarded as generally beneficial, but essential to spiritual development in particular.

From the beginning of the 20th century onwards, going to the gym and engaging in indoors and outdoors activities gained momentum. This was partly due to a rise in people working in specialised professions, which allowed for more time to pursue healthy and rejuvenating activities.

The industrial revolution had brought about a more sedentary lifestyle and with it an increased awareness that this could have negative effects on the body.

With the emerging body culture, the focus on exercising grew stronger.

As sports and leisure activities became more widely accessible, the veneration of those excelling in physical activity and demonstrating an exceptional physique boomed as well. Being muscular now equated to being beautiful, and beauty was considered healthy.

Bodybuilding competitions were organized as early as 1901: the year of the ‘Great Competition’ at London’s Royal Albert Hall. The show, in whichSir Arthur Conan Doylesat as a member of the jury, was an immense hit, with a sold out venue and disappointed, turned-down visitors as a result.

The number of bodybuilders and competitions steadily rose in the next decades, exploding in the 1950s and 1960s. Bodybuilding magazines started to appear, federations and specialized organizations were established, and food supplements aiding to achieve that perfect shape were introduced to the market.

For the less ambitious, the integration of body exercise in the office environment or a dedicated sports holiday were viable strategies to increase mobility and counter weight gain.

A new boost in the wellness industry occurred in the last quarter of the 20th century, when the baby boomer generation started to explore ways to stay active and youthful. This generated a continuous demand for new products and services: from personal trainers to superfoods and from self-massage devices to infrared sauna cabins.

History of Karagiozis shadow theatre, a staple summer evening entertainment for many in Greece

Shadow puppet theatre is a staple summer evening entertainment for many in Greece, with what’s known as Karagiozis shadow theatre a childhood favourite.

Shadow theatre is popular in many lands - from China, India, Persia, Indochina and Asia Minor.

It seems to have come to mainland Greece, probably from Asia Minor during Ottoman rule. As the Ottoman Empire grew, the shadow puppet theatre tradition spread, evolving and adapting according to local customs, languages and stories, becoming a favorite folklore entertainment of the diverse cultures of the Ottoman Empire, including Greeks, Jews, Albanians, Turks and Arabs.

Within this multicultural society, shadow puppet theatre became multilingual and transnational, and was instrumental in keeping languages, folklore and cultural traditions alive.

The moral tales enacted by the puppeteers feature satirical observations about the social and political issues of the time - a form of social commentary understood by people of all classes.

The central character is Karagiozis, whose name now represents the genre.

Karagiozis is poor and uneducated, relying on his cunning and wit to extricate himself from precarious situations. He is a Greek folk hero for children and adults. Karaghiozis often mocks the various characters and includes them in his desperate adventures.

Although uneducated, Karaghiozis manages to bluff his way into different jobs, allowing the puppeteer to satirise prominent figures, professions and contemporary issues.

The puppet theatre uses figures as archetypes representing the various ‘classes’ or characters of the time.

‘Hammer and sickle people’ represent the craftsmen of the city including Karagiozis himself.

‘Sword people’ are represented by Veligekas, the Albanian brute who often beats Karagiozis up for no reason.

‘People of the pen’ includes members of the Muslim and Christian hierarchies, clerics and diplomats, represented by Hatziyavatis, Karagiozis’ ‘frenemy’.

The puppet show is usually accompanied by a singer with a small group of musicians as well as enough shouting, noise and witty dialogue keep the audience laughing.

While some scenarios and plots are familiar, the puppeteer improvises and adapts storylines according to the audience, enhancing them with impromptu wise cracks and bawdy remarks.

The puppets are traditionally made from translucent camel or donkey skin. Worked until it is semi-transparent, the hide was cut into the desired shape with a special knife and painted with vegetable pigments.

The joints were made by threading strings of gut through perforations made with a needle. Some of the puppets have many joints, and are usually 35-40 centimeters high. The multiple joints allow the puppets to jiggle, dance and make gestures.

The puppeteer moves the puppets using detachable rods. Between the figures and the player (who was invisible), were candles or lamps that shed light to the figures and made their silhouettes visible to the audience through the cloth.

The hilarious movement of the characters - the innocent beatings, the strange and ragged clothing, the cunning word games and numerous linguistic mistakes - are what gave Karagiozis a special place in the hearts of Greek audiences for decades.

It is interesting to compare similar children theatres across Europe. In Germany, for example, in the late 18th century, in Nuremberg, a city that traditionally produced toys and had great lithography artists,Papiertheaterwas produced as a packed toy for children.

Based on a kids favourite, the travelling peep-show, a series of paper cut images of figures were positioned one after the other like an accordion. The set included a printed ‘stage’ of buildings and settings and simplified scripts for the children to re-enact the story. The stories were classic fairy tales, like Sleeping Beauty or adult plays adapted for children. The key attraction was that the children themselves put the play together, assembled the stage and acted the script.

Probably around the same time that shadow theatre found its way from the far east to the Balkans, 16th-century Italian commedia dell'arte legacy travelled north in Europe and found roots in localised versions. One of those were 'Punch and Judy', which emerged during the Restoration Period in Britain and became popular in France and other countries.

The figure of Punch is derived from the Neapolitan stock character of Pulcinella, a subversive character who acts as 'the voice of the people', something he and Karagiozis have in common, as well as the appearance: they are both hunchback with a huge hooked nose.

In fact, Karagoz, the Turkish version of Karagiozis, is said to be the integration of Pulcinella/Punch character into Ottoman culture, alongside his European 'cousins',such as Kasperle in Southern Germany and Austria, Polichinelle in France and Petrushka in Russia, even though the technique differs: the former is shadow theatre whereas the latter uses puppets.

Punch and Judy shows were traditionally marionette shows when they were brought over from Italy and intended for an adult audience, but were later reinvented in the glove puppet style to accommodate the characters' movements without the obstruction of strings and established primarily as children's entertainment during Victorian times.

Read about adventurous Serbian journalist and his journey around the world at the beginning of 20th century.

A veil of mystery surrounds Serbian journalist and writer,Milorad Rajčevićand his journey around the world at the beginning of 20th century. Rajčević was born in a small town in south Serbia at the end of 19th century. As a young man he came to Belgrade to study to be a painter and was soon presented with the opportunity to travel to Vienna. There and then he realised that instead of painting, his one andtrue calling was travelling. Young Rajčević made a bet with the owners of Belgrade dailyMali Journalthat he wouldtravel the world in two yearson very modest resources. Very soon he started travelling across Europe as a correspondent for theMali Journal.



Milorad Rajčević, before departure,Belgrade, 1910. from the book “At the Far East” (“Na Dalekom Istoku”), p. 24, National Library of Serbia, PDM

Over a 20-year period Rajčević visited almost every continent; unfortunately Australia remained out of his reach. Everywhere he travelled, he was greeted by people there, news articles were published about him, and he even had poems written to honour him.

His adventures started in 1910, when the young globetrotter travelled from Serbia via Montenegro to Italy, and from there through the rest ofEurope: Switzerland, France, England, Germany, Belgium, Holland, Sweden, Norway, and Russia. Articles about his journeys and adventures were regularly published in dailyMali Journalthroughout 1911 and 1912 as a feuilleton entitledThe Journey around the World.

In 1924, Rajčević published the first part of histravelogueto Africa, followed by a sequel in 1925 (From Torrid Africa 1 & 2). His journey to Africa began in 1922 with visits to Egypt, Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, Zanzibar and even South Africa. He travelled by train, with caravans and on foot. He sailed on the Nile and went hunting for crocodiles. The deeper Rajčević travelled into theAfrican continent, the more he was fascinated by African tribes. He wrote extensively about their customs, laws, and ways of life, which were unknown to many readers of Rajčević’s articles and books back in Serbia.

A travelogue about his journey toAsia and the Middle EastentitledIn the Far Eastwas published in 1930, although he actually visited Asia before venturing to Africa. The book gathered stories about his adventures in Siberia, Japan, China, Thailand and India.

Rajčević spoke five languages and knew his way about. When given the chance, he also gave lectures on a variety of topics. Handsome and charismatic, Rajčević’s was popular and welcomed by many. Most of the time Rajčević travelled alone, but he did call on famous people residing in places he visited. In 1932, he published abook of autographshe had collected from famous people he had met on his travels (Autographs of  famous people of 20__thcentury).

Rajčević brought a lot of souvenirs home as proof and they were exhibited in a shop in the Belgrade city centre. His globetrotting adventures made him very popular both in Serbia and around the world. The prefaces of his books state that he also traveled through North and South America. However, since no books or newspaper articles recorded those travels, we have to take Rajčević at his word on this account. [efn_note]Unfortunately, the National Library of Serbia was ruined in WWII and therefore there are no preserved records about books published before the war. The catalogue was never fully recovered.[/efn_note]

135 years of history of the Dutch baking company Verkade

Windmills, cheese, clogs and coffee shops: a handful of words painting a picture of an entire country. Yet for the Dutch themselves, their most outstanding national icon might just be a crispy treat: the Verkade biscuit.

The Dutch baking company Verkade is not only a staple of industrial heritage but also epitomizes the hospitality and conviviality The Netherlands are known for.

In this blog, we stroll through 135 years of sweet success, with extraordinary stories that will leave you stunned as to the innovative spirit of this food industry giant.

Founded in 1886 byEricus Gerhardus Verkade, a former oil trader with no baking experience, the company started out as a factory producing steamed bread under the name ‘De Ruyter’ (the horseman).

Referring to a windmill that was located at theirZaandamfactory site, the horseman was used on packaging from early on and still features in the company logo today.

With its large-scale production processes and goods targeted at a rural population, the factory received heavy resistance from artisanal local bakers, who dropped their prices even lower and sold substandard bread branded as Verkade.

As price margins were narrow to begin with and a new law in 1919 prohibited bakers from working night shifts, Verkade soon stopped its bread production line.

This could have been the end of the story. But a forward-looking disposition and the use of high-risk strategies saved Verkade from ruin.

Its mere existence was rooted in the industrial development of the Zaan region, which had become derelict in the 19th century. As a new canal opened up a gateway to the sea and thus international trade, Ericus Verkade saw the low capacity of artisanal bakers as a unique business opportunity and ventured the gamble.

Next, he rose to the occasion of conquering a very different market. His son-in-law Morris Fowler sold him a patent for 'waxine' - a brand that would soon became synonymous with tealight candles. In 1898 Verkade became the first producer of waxine lights in the Netherlands. Only in 1991 was this part of the company sold to a specialised manufacturer.

In the meantime, Verkade had turned another opportunity into a blooming business.

Making use of the heat left in the oven after baking bread, he started producing biscuit rusk. World War I only enhanced Verkade’s entrepreneurial vigour and the factory’s focus on crispy bakes. As the import of English biscuits was no longer allowed, Verkade’s revenue between 1913 and 1918 jumped from 132,000 guilders to almost a million and a half.

Yet by the end of the war, supplies of yeast and flower grew thin.

Now led byEricus Verkade Jr., the company started focusing on 'suikerwerk' (confectionary) as sugar stocks were still high. Out of this activity a lucrative business branch producing toffees and chocolates arose, resulting in the construction of a new factory with state-of-the-art machinery in 1937 and a quadrupling of revenue in the next three years.

After having gained the epithet 'Koninklijk' (Royal) in 1950, Verkade continued its streak of success throughout the 1960s, among others introducing Knäckebröd to the Dutch market and supplying the government with 'emergency biscuits' to be distributed in case of war.

In the wake of the Cold War, many people bought their own tins of life-saving cookies, supposed to last for a couple of years. To this day, untouched packages are still being found in attics and cellars across the Netherlands.

Apart from venturing risks with regards to production processes and capacity building, Verkade’s success owes a lot to its dauntless marketing strategy.

As a pioneering example of guerilla advertising, the company employed a dedicated designer as early as 1923. Cornelis Dekker would go on to head the advertising department for 30 years and developed many of its iconic packings, often featuring blushing children with a cookie at hand: an image imprinted in the minds of many generations of Dutch people.

Yet it didn’t stop with colourful campaigns, clever imagery and catchy slogans. The Verkade brand was promoted via a wide range of merchandising, mostly directed towards children.

A board game was launched at the occasion of the 1934MacRobertson International Air Racefrom England to Australia. The game was dedicated to the victorious Dutch team, flying a KLM Royal Dutch Airlines DC-2, that came second in the race but won the handicap prize for best performance.

Sticker albums were Verkade’s most successful marketing idea. Books about nature, landscapes and fairy tale figures could be completed with stickers found in Verkade products. Even today, the 30 albums produced between 1903 and 1940 and the 5 volumes issued after 1965 are collectors’ items.

The 'Verkade girls' form a distinct and unique part of its history.

As early as 1891, six young women were employed by the Zaandam factory to clean the company trucks. From 1900 onwards, their number rapidly increased - to quickly surpass that of male workers - and their duties shifted to the production halls, where their fine fingers and gentle hands were regarded as highly beneficial for sorting, packaging, dipping biscuits in chocolate or unpicking cherry stalks.

Unfortunately, the women’s wages were lower than men’s, so the company would have also had a monetary benefit from higher female employment.

Still, at the time, it was highly unusual for companies to employ women as they were expected to focus on family, and in turn would have been wary of getting compromised in a predominantly male environment.

Verkade made maximum efforts to alleviate those concerns. Male and female workers had separate canteens (the female one boasting fine porcelain plates and luxurious cutlery), used different flights of stairs, and even travelled to the factory in separate train compartments.

The company also offered perks to make up for the harsh working circumstances and monotonous production processes. During summer, Verkade girls could enjoy breaks in a garden with swings and carousels. A drumming band provided musical distraction, while cooking courses, sewing lessons and childcare facilities made for a better work/life balance.

With its female-friendly policy, Verkade lived up to the high expectations provoked by its recruitment motto: 'Girls, come and join the Verkade workforce. And please: bring your mother!'.

Four firsts from the Eurovision Song Contest's six decades long history

The Eurovision Song Contest has been entertaining audiences across Europe for more than 60 years.

The first Eurovision Song Contest was held in 1956. Since then, much has changed: many more countries taking part, new rules, new voting systems, bigger stages and more shows with two semi-finals.

This blog looks at some Eurovision Song Contest firsts, with stories from across the decades Eurovision has taken place.

Dutch singer Jetty Paerl was the first singer on stage at the Eurovision Song Contest. When she stepped onto the stage, she probably didn't know the history she was making.

The Eurovision Song Contest in 1956 was a much smaller event than it is now. It was mainly a show for radio, though was filmed for those who owned televisions. Only 7 countries took part, compared to around 40 these days.

The Contest had come about as a way to improve and showcase new radio and telecommunications technologies. Inspired by theItalian San Remo song competition, the idea was that friendly competition between countries, broadcasters and artists would help to heal wounds and bring together a continent that just over a decade previously had been torn apart by war.

That war had played a large role in Jetty Paerl's life.

Born in 1921 in Amsterdam, by 1956, she was a popular singer. At the outbreak ofWorld War II, she escaped to the United Kingdom where she volunteered with the Dutch army's Voluntary Women's Auxiliary Corps.

In London, she became involved with Radio Oranje, which broadcast news and entertainment shows from London to the Netherlands, then occupied by Nazi Germany. After the war, it emerged that many of her Jewish family inAmsterdamhad not survived the war.

During her wartime broadcasts, she became known as 'Jetty from Radio Oranje', a name that stayed with her into the 1950s when she performed regularly on the radio.

Her Eurovision songDe Vogels Van Holland('The Birds of Holland') was written by Annie M.G. Schmidt, a well-known Dutch author.

In 1956, each country sent two songs to the Contest. The singer of the second tune from the Netherlands was Corry Brokken. The following year, she went on to win the Contest, held in Frankfurt, with the songNet Als Toen.

Another difference in the 1956 Eurovision is that we only know the winner - the other positions were not announced. Switzerland took the prize - the songRefrainwas sung by Lys Assia, the first Eurovision winner.

Dutch singer Anneke Grönloh was the first Asian performer to take part in the Contest. Grönloh, who was born in Indonesia, moved to the Netherlands with her family after World War II. Her singing career started in the late 1950s, having won a talent competition.

She represented theNetherlandsin the 1964 Eurovision Song Contest. Her songJij bent mijn leven('You are my life') placed joint 10th with the Belgian entry.

Two years later, Milly Scott was the first black singer to perform in theEurovision Song Contest.

Milly Scott was born in 1933 in the Netherlands to a Surinamese family. By the 1960s, she had built a successful jazz career. In 1965, she had her own TV show which led to her taking part in the Eurovision Song Contest the following year.

She took part in the 1966 Contest in Luxembourg with her songFernando en Filippowhich placed 15th (out of 18 entries).

Today, Eurovision is known for being celebrated byLGBTQ+ audiences. Through the 2000s and beyond, an increasing number of drag performers took part in Eurovision (including Slovenia in 2002, Denmark in 2007) with Conchita Wurst winning the Contest in 2014.

This was not always the case. The first drag performer on stage in Eurovision was in 1986. Jonny Nymoen, a performer from the troupe Great Garlic Girls, was a backing dancer for Norway's entryRomeosung by Ketil Stokkan.

Films and photographs from backstage at the Eurovision Song Contest

For most of us, the Eurovision Song Contest is a show we tune into once a year, one Saturday in May. But the Contest is much more than that.

During the week preceeding that Saturday, two semi-final shows are broadcast (on the Tuesday and Thursday). Two weeks of rehearsals take place beforehand. Eurovision host cities often stage concerts, special events and other celebrations to mark the occasion. Preparations for the show start nearly a year in advance - not least selecting the songs and singers, which usually takes place in the early months of spring.

For some fans, Eurovision is all year round. With films and photographs from cultural heritage instutitions across Europe, let's go backstage at the Eurovision Song Contest.

Following their win in 1970, Ireland hosted the Eurovision Song Contest for the first time in 1971. This film reports from behind-the-scenes the day before the Contest.

Juries are an important part of the Eurovision Song Contest.

Nowadays, juries are made of 5 people with music industry experience, whose votes are combined with those of us at home. Previously, juries have been made up of a mix of professionals and music fans.

This report from Belgian broadcaster RTBF shows how the Belgian jury vote was arranged for the 1976 Eurovision Song Contest.

In the early 1990s, in the wake of the fall of the Iron Curtain and the dissolution of Yugoslavia, many countries wanted to compete in Eurovision for the first time. To keep the final to the three-hour timeframe, a pre-qualifying show was held in which 8 countries competed for three places in the final.

Performers from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia took part in the show in April 1993, which was staged in Ljubljana.

This report includes rehearsal footage and interviews with performers from the show.

Corsica

Autun and Brienne

Paris

Elba Island

Saint Helena

Discover the story of Napoleon Bonaparte and his many stages of isolation.

An eagle flies from island to island, as far as the arid hilltops of Saint Helena. Throughout his life, Napoleon often found himself rather isolated - both physically and socially.

Born in Corsica in 1769, and having left by the age of ten for France, Napoleon returned during its revolution in 1786. He attempted to rally Corsica against France, during a sort of failed rebellion, which led him to feel alone and isolated in his own country. He then fled the island for Paris, returning to the France he hated.



Door of the Brienne college, 1780, August -Jacques Régnier, Bibliothèque nationale de France, No copyright- other known legal restrictions

In January 1779, Napoleon was sent to Autun to begin his education. In school, he had to learn French. Only speaking Corsican, he was the victim of xenophobia. His comrades ridiculed this barely French boy who, along with his brother Joseph, shared few of their habits.

He entered Brienne in May 1779 to start his military training, which did not improve his situation. At that time, Napoleon was fiercely a Corsican nationalist. In his correspondence to his father, he asked for  ’_An Account of Corsica_’ by Boswell. He planned to write his own account of the island, and continued to blame the French for the submission of his homeland.

Before entering the seat of power in 1804, Napoleon saw Paris as the capital of his pain. The distance that cut him off from his family and his homeland obsessed the young Bonaparte.

Paris embodied, as the philosopher Emil Cioran liked to quote_,_ ‘a coat made of lead’ which deprived Napoleon of the simple and bourgeois life he dreamed of during times of crisis, while knowing full well that this type of existence wouldn't suit him.

On 4 May 1814, Napoleon, exiled by allied powers, landed in Porto-Ferrajo on the Island of Elba.

He was devastated by the death of his ex-wife Josephine on 29 May, the wait for his wife Marie-Louise and their son, who never came, then the very brief visit of Princess Walewska, his mistress, and their son.

In addition, his presence, a few kilometres from Italy and France, particularly worried the English and Louis XVIII, who considered exiling Napoleon to a small island in the Atlantic to prevent him returning to power.

During the journey from France to Saint Helena, on board two ships, Bellerophon and Northumberland, Napoleon started working on his journalThe Memorialwith author Emmanuel, comte de Las Cases. This would become a reference to his exile on Saint Helena.

The emperor's last home was also his longest and most painful confinement (16 October 1815 - 5 May 1821, date of his death). By the end of his life, he was a fallen Napoleon, weakened by illness and unable to get up from his bed. He spent hours reading and sleeping, and was slowly running out of breath. Never had an exile and confinement become so legendary.

Saint Helena represented the necessary distance that enabled Napoleon to have an air of mystery and suffering that raised him to the level of a god.

Take a look into a dynamic life of a naval officer at the beginning of the 19th century.

Between 1819 and 1844 Dutch navy officer Marcus Wels (1794-1865) took his album amicorum, or autograph book, with him on his travels overseas.

The album is now in the possession of the Koninklijke Bibliotheek in The Hague. It gives us an insight into the dynamic life of a naval officer at the beginning of the 19th century.

It is the 5th of February, 1831. A shrill, cold north-westerly wind is blowing over the river Scheldt near Antwerp and commanding officer Jan van Speijk has trouble maneuvering his ship away from the shore.

Van Speijk has been stationed in the harbour of Antwerp since September 1830 with his gun-boat Zr. Ms. No. 2, fighting revolutionaries who want to separate Belgium from the recently unified United Kingdom of the Netherlands.

Van Speijk cannot prevent his ship from being blown against the embankment and Belgian rebels jump aboard. In the gunpowder room of his ship, he signs his own death warrant and that of his crew, by lighting a burning cigar to a fuse and blowing up the whole ship.

Not far from the disastrous scene, lieutenant Marcus Wels (1794-1865) is sailing on board the frigate Zr. Mrs. Euridice, a small battleship of the Dutch navy. Like the Zr. Ms. No. 2, the Euridice is part of the Dutch war fleet in Antwerp from 1830-1831.

The self-sacrifice of Van Speijk in the harbour of Antwerp caused great admiration in the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

As a commanding officer, Jan van Speijk already had a fierce reputation before his illustrious death. It is therefore no surprise that his name can be found in the album amicorum of Marcus Wels.

Wels started to collect signatures when he was 25 years old, at the beginning of his career as a naval officer. He took his album on his sea voyages and many of his colleagues wrote a contribution in the booklet.

The curious contribution of Van Speijk in the album amicorum by Marcus Wels not only stands out because of his reputation but also because of the lack of any text, date or place. Van Speijk only inscribed the page with the text 'Uwe Gehoorzame Dienaar J.C.J. van Speijk ‘[Your Faithful Servant, J.C.J. van Speijk].

Did the impatient Jan van Speijk not have the time or inclination to write a personal contribution for a colleague? Did he want to avoid the chore by quickly writing his signature? Or was this scribble the start and was he planning to add text later?

None of the above. If one investigates the paper and the signature closely, one notices that the contribution of Van Speijk has been written on different paper, paper which was mostly used for letter writing.

In all likelihood, Marcus Wels managed to get his hands on a message Van Speijk had sent to the frigate Zr. Mrs. Euridice. Sometime after the heroic death of Van Speijk, Wels decided to cut out his signature and add Van Speijk’s illustrious name to his own album amicorum. The paper even has the folds which indicate its former use as a letter.

This would also explain the lack of a personal contribution. Because of his celebrity status, Van Speijk’s personal effects were much sought after and Marcus Wels’ album suddenly became a treasured possession.

It is more than likely that Marcus Wels showed his album amicorum to his family and told stories about his life as a naval officer and his adventurous trips to Suriname and the Mediterranean. One can image that the sheet of paper with the signature of Jan van Speijk gave rise to an epic story about that stubborn patriotic commander in the harbour of Antwerp in 1830.

It remains unclear, however, if Marcus Wels actually knew or ever met Jan van Speijk personally.

Spreading diseases

Beda Hallberg

International aid

Mayflower memories

Mayflowers today

Swedish woman Beda Hallberg started selling paper flowers to raise money for those with tuberculosis

How can you encourage people to donate money for a good cause? At the beginning of the 20th century, Beda Hallberg, a young Swedish woman, struggled with exactly this question. She wanted to raise funds for people suffering from tuberculosis – a small paper flower was the answer to her question.



Tuberculosis is a severe infectious disease that mostly affects the lungs. In the 19th and early 20th century, it was a widespread disease in Europe, especially among poorer people in urban areas.

After the Industrial Revolution, growing industries and the need for workers in factories led to mass migration to cities. Populations in cities and other centres of industrial production expanded, leading to catastrophic housing conditions for workers and their families. With many people living in small apartments or in the same rooms, it was difficult to prevent diseases from spreading. Tuberculosis thus led to 1 in 4 deaths in 19th century Europe.

Throughout Europe, different organisations and groups started to campaign against the spread of tuberculosis and in support of the urban poor. In Sweden, private initiatives first raised funds to send people to sanatoria and raise awareness around how to limit the spread of the disease.

Beda Hallberg was an active member of Gothenburg’s charity movement.

Born in 1869, she was the youngest daughter of a captain and a farmer’s daughter. Her father left the family one year after her birth to emigrate to the US. Her mother and her four siblings lived in really simple conditions. Nevertheless, her mother tried to help poor and ill neighbours.

From the age of 12 on, Beda lived with her aunt in Gothenburg, where she later married a tobacco dealer in 1888. From the 1890s on, she volunteered for an organisation that took care of the poor in Gothenburg and visited families in their homes – where tuberculosis was a wide-spread issue. She realised soon that more money was needed to help them - and that traditional ways to raise funds - such as bazaars - were not enough.

In 1906, her daughter Margot came home with a little paper badge commemorating Gustavus Adolphus Day. That gave Beda the idea of selling small paper flower pins in exchange for a donation towards people suffering from tuberculosis in Gothenburg.

She founded a committee includingFrigga Carlberg, a feminist social worker and writer, as well as the municipal physician K. J. Gezelius. Despite others doubting her idea, she ordered 100,000 blue-coloured paper flower pins and decided to sell them for 10 Öre each (around 50 cent today), so that nearly everyone could afford to buy one.

Her campaign became a tremendous success. Around 139,000 Mayflowers were sold on the 1 May 1907 in Gothenburg – exceeding even Beda’s expectations.

A local newspaper wrote the following:

'The blue flower has won. The whole city celebrates it. You see it everywhere, wherever you come, on lapels and coats, scarves and shawls. Businessmen, civil servants, workers, old men and children, tram conductors, police officers, kayakers, drivers – they all carry the flower and feel that everyone is happy to be involved. It is the ideal of ideas: simple, enthusiastic and poignant.'

Other countries soon became interested in Beda Hallberg’s initiative.

Just two years later, Mayflowers had spread to all Nordic countries, and later to the Netherlands, Belgium, Russia, Germany, England and France. Even Algeria, Cuba, the USA and India started selling Mayflowers to support the fight against tuberculosis.

Children were at the focus of Beda Hallberg’s work.

From her visits to families’ homes, she knew that children were especially at risk to infect with tuberculosis and become severely ill. The money she raised with the campaign was hence used to send children to sanatoria and summer camps to protect them from the spread.

Building on her friendship with the founder of the Swedish scout movement, Ebbe Lieberath, she involved schoolchildren in selling the flowers, raising also their awareness for the conditions of poorer children.

Helene, who was born in Finland in 1941 and emigrated to Germany later in her life, shares her memories of selling Mayflowers during her childhood:

'On the First of May, the scouts always had a parade all the way to the Cathedral. We had to wear the scout uniform all week, both when we were in school and when we sold the Mayflowers. And we had to sell at least ten – I always tried to sell them to my family and relatives. Later, I was always happy to have Mayflowers.'

Her granddaughter Flora, who grew up in Germany, received Mayflowers from relatives in Finland and recalls: 'Mayflowers have an almost identity-establishing effect on me: wearing one abroad reminds me of this tradition of solidarity even outside of Finland'.

With the rise of vaccines and treatments and a rise in living quality in the second half of the 20th century, cases of tuberculosis decreased rapidly. In most countries, Mayflower initiatives disappeared.

Only the Nordic countries and Estonia still hold the tradition of selling and wearing Mayflowers dear. Today, the raised money is donated to poorer families and children in need.

Beda Hallberg was awarded theIllis quorummedal and the Order of Vasa by the Swedish king in 1914 and 1931. She became the chairwoman of the Swedish National Association against Tuberculosis in 1919 and travelled through the US for five months in 1931 to promote Mayflowers among Swedish emigrants.

She died in 1945, having become internationally known for her charity work.

Marbling techniques made endpapers beautiful and artistic, as well as a practical bookbinding tool.

Have you ever opened up a book and discovered that the inside of the cover had a beautiful illustration, colour or pattern?

The double sheet of paper partly glued to the inside of the cover of a book is called an endpaper - the first and last sheets of paper in a book, dividing text from cover.



Historically, endpapers were often simply blank pieces of scrap paper, parchment or vellum that were used to keep the text safe from wear and tear. They might contain a bookplate showing ownership, or some scribbles where someone had tested a newly cut pen.

Decorated endpapers became popular from the 18th century, inspired by paper marbling techniques originating in the Middle East and Asia.

Marbling made the endpaper more than just a practical solution in bookbinding, but a place for beauty and art. Paper can be marbled using a variety of different techniques and styles. The result is always completely unique, no two marbled papers will ever be exactly the same.

Paper marbling is achieved by putting paper on top of patterened paint sitting on the surface of water.

Even though every piece of marbled paper is different, some simple patterns were very popular in the 18th and 19th centuries, acting as starting points for more intricate and unique designs.

A nonpareil pattern (nonpareilis French for 'without equal) is one of the basic patterns in paper marbling. It is made by using a comb-like implement to pull streaks across the marbling paint.

The Turkish pattern, or 'stone' pattern, is one of the most used basic patterns in marbling. Bristles or a brush are used to sprinkle different colours of paint down on the surface of the water.

The different colours push each other away, creating a swirled, earthy look.

The 'Italian pattern' was most-likely named as it resembles the patterns found in real Italian marble.

While printing technology advanced throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, endpapers became more lavishly decorated with different kinds of patterns and illustrations.

Marbled paper increasingly became machine-made, with other types of illustrations - such as floral or geometric patterns - began appearing on endpapers.

Endpapers are also a good place to put maps. They can cover two full pages at once, or even folding out to show things on a larger scale.

Marbling paper is an easy and fun activity to do at home, so if you feel creative you can go look up one of the many tutorials online on how to marble paper!

With repetitive patterns, embossing and gilding, marbled paper is just one of the myriad ways to decorate endpapers today. However, generally, Books printed today make less use of endpapers.

Now and then, you'll open up a book and be pleasantly surprised by the decoration of its endpapers.

Meet four people from history who reacted to the negative changes in their environment.

Environmental awareness is nothing new. A 2018 Greenpeace article on the history of environmentalism mentions that the first human recording of ecological awareness appears 5,000 years ago. An ancient city around that time in modern day Pakistan called Mohenjo Daro, was known to practice waste management and already recognised the effects of pollution on health.

Figures throughout history have reacted to the negative changes in their environment - this blog introduces some of them.

Hippocrate’s bookAir, Waters, and Placesis said to be the earliest known surviving European work on human ecology.

In a period when people thought sickness was caused by gods, Greek physician Hippocrates (460 – c. 370 BC) became one of the most remarkable figures of the history of medicine. He detailed that people’s health was affected by not only what they consumed, but also the environment in which they lived.

John Elevyn (1620-1702) was an English writer and gardener.

In 1661, he publishedFumifugiuma letter addressed to King Charles II, which outlined the effects of air pollution caused by sea-coal burning. Said to be one of the earliest known works on air pollution, it discusses problems with London’s air dating as far back as medieval times.

He proposed planting large gardens to further improve air quality. He also recommended moving industries known for causing high levels of pollution - such as fabric dying, soap, salt and brewing - to areas outside the city of London.

American artist George Catlin (1796-1872) was known for his paintings of Native American life.

In 1832, a New York newspaper published articles by him. One specifically called for the creation of national parks in an effort to preserve American wilderness and the Native American communities who depended on them. His campaign was widely acclaimed - but not taken seriously until soon after his death.

Controversially, the first national parks created lead to further removal of Native Americans from their lands.

Rachel Carson (1907-1964) was an American author, marine biologist and conservationist whose poetic bookThe Sea Around Uswas a best seller and launched her into the public eye.

Silent Spring, her best known book, brought her most critical acclaim.

The book discusses the harmful effects of pesticides on the environment. By the 1960s, this was already a documented issue. Her skills in combining poetry and science helped her reach a much broader audience, and she is credited for helping to launch the modern environmental movement.

Looking at these four historical figures, it can be daunting to realise that the environmental issues they highlighted are still something to this day that we are tackling - in one form or another - throughout the world.

Though we may have come a long way from the time of Hippocrates, we still have a very long way to go to restore a more sustainable way of life not just for our own benefit but for that of the earth and all living species.

Read about Božidar Knežević, one of the most significant Serbian philosophers at the turn of the 20th century.

How can someone be born to be forgotten? They can be forgotten by the general public, even though their birth or death anniversary is commemorated. This is precisely the case with Božidar Knežević (1862-1905), one of the most significant Serbian philosophers at the turn of the 20th century. LikeBranislav Petronijević(1875-1954), he was born in Ub, a little Serbian town located some 60km south-west of Belgrade. His stepfather was a petty trader, just like Knežević’s birthfather. Knežević graduated in history and philology and worked as a high school teacher, from 1902 in Belgrade. He took part in the Serbian – Bulgarian War of 1885 and died in 1905 of a lung disease contracted in the war.

During his studies, he taught himself English. Through his translations, he acquainted the Serbian cultural public with contemporary British historiographical works such asOn Heroes, Hero-Worship and The Heroic in Historyby Thomas Carlyle.

Knežević’s best known work isPrinciples of History (Principi istorije), published in two volumes (1898- 1901). In Knežević’s own words, it was poorly read and received. Following Petronijević’s advice, Knežević tried to familiarize readers with his work with the help of aphorisms, which he published in the work entitledThoughts (Misli).Thanks to it, thePrincipleshave not been completely forgotten. History forms Knežević’s philosophy. He sees it not just as the history of humanity, but also as the supreme philosophy and science, encompassing the history of the universe and nature since its creation. The history of mankind cannot be understood separately from the history of nature. Building on Darwin’s and Spencer’s evolutionary theories, Knežević introduced two main principles: the law of order and the law of proportion_._ According to the law of order, once every being is in harmony and takes up exactly as much space as required, everything will cease to exist. Therefore, the world and everything else can be created and can disappear only once, so there is no going back to the beginning. The principle of thenecessityof things is crucial, as things come into existence because they are needed and in the order in which they are needed.

His work is fundamentally original, but experts cannot agree on the nature of his philosophy: he was deemed a religious philosopher, a metaphysical idealist, a pantheist, a deist, a theist, and a materialist.

The National Library of Serbia possesses several Božidar Knežević’s manuscripts. Among them,The Notebookis particularly important. In it, Knežević describes his travels throughout southern Serbia in 1896, as well as the visit to Rijeka and Opatija at the end of 1897. His daughter Milka gave a touching account of Knežević’s private life and his family in her manuscript calledMy parents’ life, which is also held at the National Library of Serbia.

Božidar Knežević’s works were first presented abroad thanks to the efforts of George Vid Tomashevich who translated the abridged edition ofThe Principles of Historyinto English in New York in 1980.

Hero and Leander

Tristan and Isolde

Two stories from classic literature of lovers separated by forces outside of their control.

Inpart 1of this blog series we highlighted two stories from classic literature, and depictions of those stories in art, of lovers separated by forces outside of their control.

Here are two more stories of classic star-crossed lovers, with beautiful illustrations found in Europeana. Read the first two stories inPart 1.



Greek mythology is filled to the brim with tragic tales of love.

The myth of Hero and Leander has them not separated by differences in social status or pre-existing marriages, but simply by physical distance. Hero, a priestess of Aphrodite, lives in Sestos at one side of the Hellespont. Leander lives in Abydos, at the other side of the strait of water.

Madly in love with each other but not able to meet, Leander's desire to see Hero was so strong that he would swim across the Hellespont every night. Hero would shine a light in the darkness from atop her tower to guide Leander across the waters.

On a blustery winter night, the wind blew out Hero's light, and Leander was tossed by the waves, disoriented. Leander drowned in the Hellespont, and upon seeing his body Leander threw herself off of her tower to join Hero in the sweet embrace of death.

The final star-crossed couple we're highlighting in this blog series are Tristan and Isolde.

In some version, their story ends in a happy ending instead of in mutual suicide, as in others. The original legend of Tristan and Isolde (their names have a lot of different spellings: Tristram, Iseult amongst others) has both of them surviving, marrying, and living a happy life together.

The story of Tristan and Isolde has many different versions in different languages and time periods. The Arthurian legends of Lancelot and Guinevere were most likely influenced by Tristan and Isolde.

Tristan and Isolde as told by Wagner in his opera of the same name casts both lovers back into tragedy. Depictions of Tristan and Isolde after 1865 often reference Wagner's play or at least show Wagnerian influences.

In Wagner's retelling of Tristan and Isolde, Tristan is transporting Isolde to Cornwall where she has been promised in marriage to king Marke. Isolde despises Tristan, for he is the murderer of her former fiancée, Morold. Her hate for Tristan runs so deep that she orders her handmaid to create a poisoned drink that she can give to Tristan.

Accepting that he should die because of what he did to Morold, Tristan drinks the poison. Isolde, not seeing any future in her forced marriage with the king of Cornwall, drinks the other half of the poisoned drink. It is then that they discover that the handmaiden had given them not poison, but a love potion.

Isolde is married to king Marke as planned, but the love potion drives Tristan and Isolde to meet in secret.

When the king is hunting at nightfall, Isolde calls Tristan to the castle where they declare their love for each other. Their passions continue throughout the night, both of them ignoring the cries of the handmaiden warning them of daybreak. King Marke catches Tristan and Isolde red-handed, entwined in embrace.

In medieval versions of Tristan and Isolde, at this point both are sentenced to death - but the lovers manage to escape together. They are once again discovered hiding in the forest together by the king, but succeed in making peace with the king. Tristan and Isolde travel to Brittany, where they marry and live on happily ever after.

Wagner's version is much more tragic. After a swordfight with the king's entourage Tristan escapes, alone, to Brittany, waiting for his lover to arrive by ship. Just as Isolde's ship arrives in the harbour, Tristan succumbs to the wounds he sustained in the swordfight. Isolde collapses next to her true love, and dies.

The meaning behind the acronyms and abbreviations used to describe firms and organisations across Europe.

Across Europe, there are many acronyms and abbreviations used to describe the legal status of firms and organisations.

But what exactly do these all mean and what's their significance? Here's a short explainer on what some of these mean, why, when and where they are used.



These abbreviations, mostly used before and after the names of firms and companies, tell us how the organisation is owned and funded.

Specific details vary across Europe, but broadly can be divided into whether stocks and shares in the company can be traded publicly (for example on the stock exchange) or are owned privately.

The legal statutes of many companies also indicate that they are limited liability - in other words, their shareholders' liability in the firm is limited to a fixed sum, most often their investment.

So here are some of the more common abbreviations that you may recognise, with examples of how they are used fromEuropeana.

A.B.

AB stands for Aktiebolag, denoting a limited company. It is used mostly in Swedish-speaking countries. Examples includeAB EricssonandAB Scania.

A.G.

AG stands for Aktiengesellschaft, a German word for a corporation limited by share ownership. Examples includeVolkswagen AGandSiemens AG.

GmbH

GmbH stands for Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung, meaning a company with limited liability. It's used in German-speaking countries.

Ltd.

Ltd stands for Limited, used in United Kingdom and Ireland to denote a private limited company

S.r.l.

Let's explore Spijkennise - a small town in south Holland, home to Eurovision winner Duncan Laurence.

Though now cancelled, the 2020 Eurovision Song Contest was due to be held in the Netherlands, thanks to Duncan Laurence's victory in 2019.

In his songArcade, Duncan, who was born in the small town of Spijkenisse, mentions his home town, singing about being 'a small town boy in a big arcade'.

But where is Spijkenisse and what's to be found there? Let's take a virtual trip to this town in South Holland through digitised cultural heritage.

Spijkenisse is located on a creek of the Oude Maas river. Its name comes from the words spieke (spit) and nesse (nose) meaning 'pointy nose' referring to a spit of land along the river.

There's evidence that the areas around Spijkenisse have been populated for centuries, with a farming and fishing village growing alongside the creek.

This part of the Netherlands, in particular, is a delta. Railways, motorways, tunnels and bridges link areas that are separated by seas and water. The Spijkenisse bridge was first built in 1903, primarily as a railway bridge.

The oldest building in Spijkenisse is the village church, built in the mid 15th century.

Windmills are a symbol of the Netherlands. Spijkenisse is home to the Nooitgedacht flour mill, which was built around 1840.

From the 1960s onwards, Spijkenisse grew from a small village to a large town, in part due to it being nearby the port of Rotterdam. Through the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, thousands of homes were built, and the Rotterdam metro reached the town.

The proximity to water and Delta Works - a series of construction projects in the region to protect land from the sea - and the fact the town developed in the latter half of the 20th century, has led to interesting examples of 20th century architecture in the town's public and civic buildings.

The Spijkenisse public library, called De Boekenberg, is shaped like a pyramid or mountain.

Pyramus & Thisbe

Aeneas & Dido

Today we bring you the first two of five stories of love made impossible by physical distance - stories of longing, heartache, and yearning in European literature and art.

Love thwarted by outside forces is a common literary theme. It can be found in many cultures and time periods - fromEurope,IndiaandChinathroughSouth Americatothe Middle East. Often these tragic relationships are forbidden by parents, existing marriages, differences in social or financial status, warring countries, or fairytale barriers.

We will highlight five stories of love made impossible by physical distance - stories of longing, heartache, and yearning in European literature and art - a feeling a lot of us might get to know well in these times of quarantine and social distancing. Today we bring you the first two, and next week we'll feature two more love stories.

The story of Pyramus and Thisbe is often seen as the blueprint for the classic play Romeo and Juliet. Shakespeare coined the termstar-crossed lovers- Pyramus and Thisbe were prime examples.

Pyramus and Thisbe live in neighboring houses. Their parents have a long-standing quarrel with each other. This dispute does not prevent Pyramus and Thisbe from falling madly in love with each other. Their only way to communicate is through a small crack in the wall adjoining their houses, through which they profess their love for each other.

As with most tragic love stories, this one doesn't end well. There are not many depictions of Pyramus and Thisbe showing how they whispered to each other through the wall. Most focus on how they both take their own lives.

In the Aeneid, the Ancient Greek epic, we find yet another love story ending in tragedy.

Written by Virgil in the 1st century BCE, it follows the story of Aeneas, a Trojan hero, who - by the fates of the god - becomes enamoured with Dido, the Queen of Carthage. A storm has just wrecked Aeneas' fleet, and he meets Dido and wins her favour in the temple of Juno in Carthage where Aeneas has taken shelter. Aeneas spends time with Dido and recounts his past travels and adventures to her, making them fall in love.

This is where the story ideally would have ended, but that would not have taken the jealousy of King Iarbas into account, whose love for Dido stayed unrequited. Iarbas prays to his father, the god Jupiter, cursing Dido for not answering his love but falling head over heels for Aeneas instead. Jupiter answers Iarbas' prayer by ordering Mercury to send Aeneas to conquer the lands of Italy.

Aeneas, dutiful as ever, begrudgingly follows Mercury's guidance and leaves by ship in the night. Some accounts say he was too heartbroken to actually tell Dido he had to leave. Others show his tearful goodbyes from Dido.

Dido's insurmountable sadness leads her to build a funeral pyre for herself and stabbing herself to death with a sword given to her by Aeneas.

Supermarkets have been the main way we shop for groceries in Europe since the 1950s, giving us more freedom by allowing us customers to choose our products.

When you last visited the supermarket, did you notice who was working there and what they did?



Most likely, there was someone at the cash desk whom you paid. Perhaps there were some people stocking the shelves, ensuring fresh and plentiful produce to buy. Perhaps too there were people selling or serving fresh produce - a butcher, fishmonger or baker?

There was once a time, when grocery shopping, that customers asked shopkeepers for each item to be fetched from the shelves. Many products were measured and weighed for the customer’s wishes, as goods were not individually wrapped or packaged. This made shopping a slower process, and, as more staff were involved, more expensive.

Supermarkets have existed in Europe since the 1950s. In the early half of the 20th century, various self-service store models began emerging in the United States, which in turn moved to Europe.

Tesco in the United Kingdom, Delhaize in Belgium, Carrefour in France and Spar from the Netherlands are among the early examples. Existing organisations changed their store models to self-service supermarkets.

As consumer-culture and car ownership grew through the 1950s and 1960s, so too did the model of supermarkets - increasingly to larger self-service all-purpose super-stores that shoppers drive to on the edges of towns and cities.

Today, supermarkets are arguably the main way we do our grocery shopping in Europe.

Supermarkets gave us more freedom, allowing us customers to choose our products, and, by or large, keep these private without the whole store hearing our choices.

Increasingly stores offer services beyond groceries: for example, banking, post offices, alcohol sales, clothing.

Supermarket brands have become multinational brands operating in many countries. This has led to criticism of supermarkets as a business model. Their interactions with suppliers, the necessity to have additional packaging as well as their food waste from their product distribution models can be questioned from environmental and ethical standpoints.

In supermarkets, we find lots of regional variety and differences. Many of us know the feeling of 'exploring' a supermarket in a foreign country - finding new products and brands we’ve never seen before. And also discovering familiar similarities - brands sold across several European countries.

Next time you are grocery shopping, perhaps you’ll remember this blog. For while we tend to think of culture as being about great works of art, hopefully this shows that cultural heritage can be found in everyday places such as the supermarket.

Richard Lepsius, a Prussian  archaeologist, is seen as a pioneer of German Egyptology, for dispelling the idea that Ancient Egypt was a static unchanging culture.

Prussian egyptologist, archaeologist and head of the Egyptian museum in Berlin in the 19th century, Richard Lepsius had a fundamental influence in the way Egyptian history is depicted and exhibited in museums.

He was the first to show the historical changes of Ancient Egypt by ordering Egyptian artefacts in chronological order instead of thematic order. By dispelling the idea that Ancient Egypt was a static unchanging culture, Lepsius is seen as a pioneer of German Egyptology.

Prof. Richard Lepsius,1868. Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Germany, CC BY-NC-SA

Some of the major European historical museums have impressive collections dedicated to the history of Ancient Egypt. They were often created in the 19th century through expeditions of colonial explorers and later Egyptologists.

In 1823, the first Egyptian department opened up in the British Museum in London displaying the collection of Henry Salt. The first museum especially for Egyptian antiquities opened in 1824 in Turin. Egyptian departments in the Louvre and Leiden were following in 1826.

All of these collections were arranged thematically - objects of the same type were put together to emphasize the comparison between similar objects. The exhibitions should be symmetrical and aesthetic, not chronological. Egyptian art was seen as static with no discernible development.

A few years later the Prussian King Frederick William IV sent an expedition to Egypt led by the young researcher and Egyptologist Karl Richard Lepsius from 1842 to 1845. His aim was to bring important sculptures and architectural elements to Berlin as well as plaster casts of original objects and papyri.

Lepsius travelled from Memphis and the pyramid fields to Luxor, then further south along the White and Blue Nile to Central Sudan, finally to the Red Sea and onto the Sinai.

Suddenly the Royal Museum had one of the largest collections of Egyptian antiquities in Europe that would no longer fit into the Monbijou Palace.

Since 1841, the Spree island should be transformed into a 'sanctuary of art and learning' and the second museum, the Neues Museum, was built in 1843 to 1855. The Neues Museum would host the Egyptian department. While the Neues Museum was being built, Lepsius was still busy collecting artefacts during his expeditions in Egypt.

Although he was not the director of the Egyptian department, Lepsius wrote during the Egyptian expedition to the director general of the Royal Museums how the rooms of the Egyptian department in the Neues Museum should be designed. He wanted them to be painted with landscape scenes from Egypt and Sudan, as well as with scenes from Egyptian graves with the same richness of colour that he had seen in Egypt. The paintings should be supported by the architecture of the rooms, which should take up the different architectural styles of the different times.

Lepsius was the first to discover an evolution in the Egyptian art and architecture and pointed out three periods of development.

This is why he saw the chronological arrangement of the objects as the only correct one - unlike the director of the Egyptian department, Giuseppe Passalacqua. By placing the objects in front of the painted backdrops, Lepsius wanted to create a historical understanding of Egyptian art.

Finally Lepsius prevailed against Passalacqua's antiquated ideas and was appointed co-director of the Egyptian department in 1855. He would go on to publish multiple seminal works on Egyptology, influencing the field further. He was especially interested in language, creating a standard alphabet for transliterating African languages, and coining new terms such asTotenbuch, literally translated as 'Book of the Dead'.

One of the great achievements that we owe to Lepsius is that we have given Egyptian art a place in the cultural history of Western society andthat we can tell stories and show narrative through the beautiful historical artefacts collected in our museums.

Mostly known as an author of the beloved books for kids around the world, Astrid Lindgren was also an outspoken supporter of children rights and animal protection. Learn more about her life in this blog.

Astrid Lindgren is mostly known as the author of beloved books for kids. From ‘The Children of Noisy Village’ to ‘The Brothers Lionheart’ and ‘Ronja, the Robber's Daughter’ Lindgren’s brave and smart characters inhabited the imaginations of millions of children around the world. Born in a small village of Näs in Sweden, her happy childhood inspired many of her future works. Time spent outside when helping her family on the farm and playing with her siblings awaken her love and curiosity of nature.

It may come as a surprise but Lindgren never aspired to be a writer. When she was at school, everyone expected her to follow this path, however, she was scared if she could ever live up to that. Later in life, Lindgren was constantly asked by her own children to tell them wondrous tales. One of her most famous characters was born when her daughter asked for a bedtime story about Pippi Longstocking.“Because it was a strange name, it had to be an equally strange girl”,Lindgren said. The story of the eccentric and independent redhead would never become a book if Lindgren didn’t sprain her ankle and decided to write down Pippi’s adventures while being forced to rest. When the book about Pippi was published in 1945, it became a huge success that changed Lindgren’s life. After that, Lindgren was not afraid to write any more.

And so I write the way I myself would like the book to be – if I were a child. I write for the child within me.

Astrid Lindgren in Expressen, 6.12.1970

Lindgren kept creating stories for children featuring young people experiencing amazing freedom of childhood. That sense of independence and curiosity drawn many readers to her works. From fearless Pippi to stubborn Emil to sensitive Mardie and brave Ronja, Lindgren's characters were free spirits, decisive but always kind-hearted.

Lindgren did not distinguish herself only as a bestseller author but also as an outspoken supporter of children rights as well as an advocate for environment and animal protection. She fought fiercely to promote better treatment of the farm animals. It is also thanks to numerous articles she wrote between 1985-89 that positive changes in policies concerning animal welfare come about. In 1988 the Swedish government introduced a new law called in her honour Lex Lindgren. Always true to her convictions, 80 years old Lindgren viewed the event somewhat critically: 'Am I supposed to be flattered to have had this law, which in its present state is toothless, named after me?'.

In contrast to her peaceful storylines, her personal life was not free of hardships. Lindgren knew the challenges of bringing up children while being part of the workforce. She was a young working single mother - when she was nineteen her son had to be fostered abroad and Lindgren did everything to regularly visit him and write him letters. This experience gave her a greater understanding of the importance of carefree childhood.

Give the children love, more love and still more love – and the common sense will come by itself.

Astrid Lindgren in a debate concerning the rights of children in the “Husmodern” magazine, 1948

Lindgren seized every opportunity to criticise oppressive upbringings. When receiving the German Booksellers’ Peace Prize in 1978 she denounced the brutality of corporal punishment. Her speech “Never Violence!” inspired a Swedish legislative reform that prohibited physical punishment against children.

Lindgren’s funeral in 2002 was symbolically held on 8th of March, International Women’s Day, and it was attended by the street crowd of thousands of people, touched by her kind and magical worlds. Her books have been translated into107 languages, bringing strength and joy to new generations of readers.

If I have managed to brighten up even one gloomy childhood – then I’m satisfied.

Astrid Lindgren, after receiving a note ('Thank you for having brightened up a gloomy childhood.') from a reader she had met on the street.

The story of Liane de Pougy: a courtesan, a princess and a saint - all in one lifetime.

You might recognise Liane de Pougy's face from a vintage poster or photograph. Behind the beautiful woman from the old pictures, there's an incredible story. This is the story of a woman who was a courtesan, a princess and a saint - all in one lifetime.



Liane de Pougy was born as Anne Marie Chassaigne on 2 July 1869 in Pays de la Loire region in France. She grew up in a nunnery.

At the age of 17, after falling pregnant, she married a naval officer Armand Pourpe. Her son, Marc Pourpe, became one of the pioneering pilots of French aviation and died aged 27 in 1914, during World War I.



Marc Pourpe à Paris [fêté après la réussite de son raid aérien du début de l'année], Bibliothèque nationale de France, No Copyright - Other Known Legal Restrictions (opens in new window)

The marriage of Anne-Marie and Armand was difficult and painful.

In her memoirs, she wrote that her husband was violent and abused her, which resulted in scars on her body which were visible until the end of her life.

According to some reports, when Armand was away on a mission, Anne-Marie began a relationship with Marquis Charles-Marie de Mac-Mahon. One day Armand caught them together in bed, and allegedly shot at his wife with a revolver.

When Anne-Marie decided leave her husband, she sold her piano and used the money to immediately run away to Paris. She left behind their young son who was raised by his grandparents. Later, she filed for divorce - even though it had recently been allowed by law, this act was considered a scandal.

In Paris, Anne Marie started her career as a cabaret dancer and courtesan.

She performed under the name of Liane de Pougy, taking the last name of one of her lovers. She danced at Folies Bergère and was considered a rival of the Spanish beauty La Belle Otero.

Liane learned the secrets of the profession of the courtesan from the Countess Valtesse de la Bigne, known as 'the courtesan of the whole Paris' and the owner of the famous bronze bed which inspired the description of the bedroom of Nana in the famous novel by Emile Zola.

In 1899 Liane de Pougy met an American writer Natalie Clifford Barney with whom she fell in love.

'That was in the days of the Amazon's youth, and of my own. We were passionate, rebels against a woman's lot, voluptuous and cerebral little apostles, rather poetical, full of illusions and dreams. We loved long hair, pretty breasts, pouts, simpers, charm, grace; not boyishness.'

The passionate relationship lasted for around a year. Natalie was young and curious, and didn't want to commit to a long-term relationship. Yet, the two women had strong feelings for each other for the remainder of her lives.

Liane described their relationship in the novelIdylle Sapphiquewhich became a bestseller. The love correspondence between Liane and Natalie has been published as a book as well.

At the height of her career in 1910, Liane met the Romanian prince Georges Ghika.

They fell in love and were married a few months later. The famous Liane was much more wealthy than the Prince Georges, whose family, though they were noble, were impoverished. Yet, she honoured her new title and as a result, changed her lifestyle and settled down.

They were happily married for sixteen years until Georges left Liane for a young artist Manon Thiébaut, who was also a former lover of Liane. To cheer herself up, Liane took a few lovers as well.

At the same time, she threatened Georges with divorce. The prince came back, but their relationship was nothing like before.

In 1928, Liane met and became friends with the Mother Superior of the Saint Agnès Asylum - an institute which took care of disabled children.

Liane supported the asylum by fundraising money among her rich Parisian friends, including Coco Chanel.

During World War II, Liane and Georges Ghika moved to Lausanne in Switzerland. There, she met Father Rzewuski, a Dominican priest who brought her closer to religion and spiritual life, became her confidant and, later, wrote the introduction to her autobiography.

After the death of her husband in 1945, Liane joined the monastic order Saint-Dominic. She remained there, as a nun, until her death in Lausanne in 1950.

Meet four early modern cookbook authors from across Europe and discover the fascinating stories of these women.

Do you remember how you learned to cook? You might have watched family members preparing meals. Maybe it was taught at your school? Or, if you’re a digital native, you found a tutorial online? Perhaps also, you picked up a cookbook and followed the directions.

In this blog, you'll meet early modern cookbook authors and discover their fascinating stories.

Cajsa Warg (23 March 1703 – 5 February 1769) was one of the best-known cooks in the Swedish history.

She left home at a young age to work as a cook and housekeeper in various wealthy houses. One of her employers was State Secretary and General Post Master Baron Leonard Klinckowström. He hosted many receptions and dinners, leading to Cajsa’s skills being recognised by the Stockholm elite.

In 1755, she published the first edition of her bookHjelpreda I Hushållningen För Unga Fruentimber('Guide to Housekeeping for Young Women'), financed by the 5000 dalers she inherited from her mother.

It contained over 800 recipes and other housekeeping advice. The book proved popular, and was published in a total of fourteen editions in Swedish, four in German, one in Finnish and one in Estonian. Following the development of new kitchen equipment and changes in used ingredients in the nineteenth century, the interest in her books dropped.

Borgarhuset, the house where Cajsa Warg was born and spent the first years of her life is one of the oldest preserved wooden buildings in the Örebro region. It is now part of the Wadköping open-air museum in the centre of Örebro, having been moved there in the 1960s.

Though there are no written accounts of this, the popular Swedish saying 'Man tager vad man haver' (You have to use what you have on hand) is traditionally attributed to Cajsa Warg.

Anne Marie Mangor, also known as Madam Mangor (12 June 1781– 16 May 1865), was an early Danish author of cookbooks.

She grew up in a bourgeois environment and, while not receiving a formal education, she had lessons in language, literature, music, crafts and social manners from a house teacher. She was happily married to a lawyer Valentin Nicolai Mangor. After her husband's death in 1812, she had to raise her three young daughters alone.

She made a living from craftsmanship. Over the years, she collected various recipes and, thinking that her collection could be useful for the others, theidea of a cookbook came to life.

In 1837, she anonymously published her first cookbookKogebog for smaa Huusholdninger(Cookbook for Small Households). After trying to publish with C. A. Reitzel but being rejected, she self-published 500 copies with the assistance of her son-in-law's brother who owned a print house.

The book became a great success, with Magnor's name included in later editions. The recipes were precise and easy to follow and the book itself was affordable, making it accessible for many households. Madam Mangor wrote two more parts of the book, all of which have been revised and republished over the years. The 40th and final edition was published in 1910.

Eliza Acton (17 April 1799 – 13 February 1859) was an English food writer and the author of the very popularModern Cookery for Private Families, one of the first English cookbooks for domestic use.

She grew up in Suffolk and later she managed a boarding school for girls. Having spent some time in France and returning to England, she wrote and published poetry.

HerModern Cookery for Private Familieswas published in 1845 by Longman, the house that earlier published her poetry. The book quickly has become a bestseller. It featured mainly English recipes with some described by the author as French and some more newer, more exotic ones like 'chatneys' (chutneys).

Each recipe included precise instructions, a list of ingredients and cooking time. This approach was considered innovative as the previous books offered more general directions.

She also stressed the importance of cooking skills in making use of every ingredient - a Victorian version of zero food waste.

It may be safely averred that good cookery is the best and truest economy, turning to full account every wholesome article of food, and converting into palatable meals what the ignorant either render uneatable or throw away in disdain.

Her recipes were alleged to have been copied by another popular cookbook writer of the time - Isabella Mary Beeton known as Mrs Beeton, the author of Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management.

Maria Ochorowicz-Monatowa (née Leszczyńska) was born in 1866 in Poland. She lived in Paris and Vienna, where she learned the techniques of French and Austrian culinary art.

After returning home, she introduced some of this style to Polish cuisine. HerUniwersalna Ksiazka Kucharska('The Universal Cookbook') contained 2,200 recipes with illustration. They were both modest and sophisticated, taking into account the necessary conditions for proper daily hygiene. It also contained information about nutrition and explained how the digestive system works.



The book received awards at the Warsaw Hygiene Exhibition in 1910 and 1926.

Maria Ochorowicz-Monatowa encouraged the readers to use seasonal ingredients and grouped her recipes according to season. There was also a chapter with nutritious vegetarian recipes - written in relation to the economical situation at the time, but extremely relevant nowadays.



The book was an obligatory purchase for many Polish households. Today, it is still available in bookshops and appreciated my many contemporary Polish chefs.

An icon in Hollywood cinema who challenged the scene and fought to humanise Chinese roles.

In a time when Hollywood was known for using white actors to play stereotypical roles of a variety of ethnicities while denying roles to qualified actors of those ethnicities, Anna May Wong (1905-1961) became an icon in Hollywood cinema who challenged the scene and fought to humanise Chinese roles.

Wong was a third generation Chinese American whose grandparents had been living in the United States since 1855. Her family lived in an integrated area of Los Angeles, and were the only Chinese American family of their neighbourhood.

From a very young age, Wong was interested in cinema and would often skip school to watch silent films. Movies were often filmed in her neighbourhood - from the age of 9, she pestered filmmakers into giving her roles.

She finally got the chance to be an extra in the filmRed Lanternat the age of 14 starring white actress Alla Nazimova as the main Chinese character. This was due to racist laws banning any intimate scenes (like kissing) between actors of different races. The film industry could bypass this law by using white actors.

After theRed Lantern,she worked consistentlyfor two years as an extra for various films. By the age of 17 she played her first leading role in the movieThe Toll of the Sea, afilm based loosely onMadame Butterfly. She received a lot of praise but despite this, Hollywood was resistant to create lead roles for her due to her ethnicity. Her next few years were spent in supporting roles as typecast exotic characters.

At 19, she played a stereotypical supporting role in the 1924 filmThe Thief of Bagdadas a ‘Dragon Lady’. Her short appearance in the film caught the attention of audiences and helped her to become more recognised.

In 1928, she left Hollywood for Europe as she was tired of being typecast and looked over for white actresses playing lead Asian roles. During her stay in Europe, she received a lot of acclaim. She also maintained close friendships with several renowned actresses of the time such as Marlene Dietrich and Cecil Cunningham which led to rumours of her sexual orientation damaging her public image.

Her last silent film in 1929Piccadillywas a mass sensation and was one of the five British films she had a starring role in.

In the 1930s, she returned to the US with promises of lead roles but still had to play Asian stereotypes. She used her new-found fame to advocate for Chinese-American causes and better roles in films for Asian actors. She is quoted to have said:

Why is it that the screen Chinese is always the villain? And so crude a villain – murderous, treacherous, a snake in the grass! We are not like that. How could we be, with a civilization that is so many times older than the West?

By the late 1930s, she played in B-movies where she acted out non-stereotypical roles that gained positive publicity in the Asian-American press. Her roles in films likeDaughter of ShanghaiandKing of Chinatownworked against the US film industry’s popular and typical portrayal of Chinese Americans.

Though she continued to be offered typecast roles throughout her career, through her public apearances and films, she helped humanise Chinese Americans to audiences during a time of extreme discrimination and racism. Her image dismissed notions of difference and otherness that western audiences had about Asians.

What was Constance Markievicz's early life?

What was Countess Markievicz's role in Irish independence?

What was Countess Markievicz's role in politics?

Political pioneer for Ireland's independence and the first woman elected to Westminster parliament

Constance Markievicz was a leader in the fight for Ireland's independence and a political pioneer. She was the first woman elected to Westminster parliament, and among the first female cabinet ministers in Europe.

Born in 1868, Constance Markievicz grew up on a large estate in Sligo in the west of Ireland. She was the daughter ofbaronet, Arctic explorer and adventurer Sir Henry Gore-Booth. Constance and her sister Eva were childhood friends of the poet W.B. Yeats.

Her childhood was cultured, wealthy and privileged. Her father, however, inspired her concern for working-class and poor people.

There were few opportunities in Dublin for women to study. In the 1890s, Constance went to train as a painter in London. There, she first became politically active and joined organisations campaigning for women's rights to vote. She later moved toParisto study at L'Académie Julian.

There, she met her husband, Casimir Markievicz - known in Paris as Count Markievicz - an artist whose wealthy Polish family was from Ukraine. They married in London in 1900, with Constance afterwards being known as 'Countess Markievicz'.

They moved toDublinin 1903, becoming part of artistic and literary worlds.

They mixed with authors, poets, playwrights, artists, painters and more - painting, performing in plays, attending salons and founding organisations. At that time in Ireland, there were growing movements for Ireland to be independent and self-ruling.

Cultural movements such as the Gaelic League promoted and preserved Irish language and culture, increased and amplified by political and revolutionary activities.

From 1908, Markievicz became actively involved in nationalist politics in Ireland.

She joined political party Sinn Féin, as well as revolutionary women's movements. In 1909, she, along with others, founded Fianna Éireann, a paramilitary youth training camp that taught teenage boys how to use guns.

In 1911 she was arrested for demonstrating against King George V's visit to Ireland. Inspired by its founder James Connolly, she joined the Irish Citizen Army. She went on to design its uniform and compose its anthem.

In April 1916, Markievicz took part in the Easter Rising, a republican rebellion against the British government in Ireland - along with other female fighters such asMary SheldreckandNora Ashe.

According to one account, she shot a member of the (unarmed) Dublin Metropolitan Police who subsequently died of his injuries.

After a surrender, she was arrested and imprisoned. While many of the 1916 rebels were executed, Markievicz was spared the death penalty because she was a woman. Instead, she was given a life sentence in prison. In 1917, she was released from prison under an amnesty for the 1916 rebellion.

In February 1918, with some women winning the right to vote, she put herself forward as a candidate at the forthcoming general election. On 28 December 1918, she was the first woman elected to the British Parliament.

In line with her party's policy, she did not take her seat in the House of Commons. Instead, she and the other Sinn Fein TDs (MPs) formed a provisional government for Ireland, Dáil Éireann (Irish parliament). She was appointed its Minister for Labour from 1919 to 1922.

The following years brought the Irish War of Independence (1919-1921) and the Irish Civil War (1922-1923).

Through the political turmoil that followed in the 1920s, Countess Markievicz continued her political campaigning and rebellious actions. She took part in a siege, was imprisoned and went on hunger strike - all in the name of fighting for Irish independence and the rights of working-class and poor inIreland.

In 1927, however, weakened after years of protest and imprisonment, Countess Constance Markievicz died aged 59. By this time, she had given away all her wealth and spent her final days in a public ward in a Dublin hospital.

Anna Atkins is widely recognised as the first ever female photographer

British botanist and photographer, Anna Atkins was a pioneer in photography: she produced the first ever photographically illustrated book and is widely recognised to the first ever female photographer.

Born in 1799, Atkins was the daughter of John George Children, a scientist and fellow of the Royal Society. He was very supportive of her scientific interests at a time when women were not welcomed into that sphere.

She was a keen botanist and scientific illustrator. When photography began to emerge as a new technique, she was one of the first to put it to good use.

Sir John Herschel, who invented the cyanotype in 1842, was a family friend and a regular visitor to the Atkins family home in Kent, England.

To make a cyanotype, objects are placed on a sheet of chemically treated paper and then exposed to sunlight. Once exposed, the paper is washed in water and dried, with the colour fully developing when dry.

Atkins was a keen artist, as well as an enthusiastic botanist. She produced drawings, watercolours and lithography. She recognised that Herschel's new invention, which required only a few chemicals, water and sunlight, offered an opportunity to approach botanical illustration in different way.

In 1843, Atkins started work producing the cyanotypes that would make upPhotographs of British Algae: Cyanotype Impressions.

The study of algae was fairly new in Britain at that time and her intention was that her work would provide illustrations for William Harvey's Manual of British Algae which had been published in 1841.

Eventually she completed three volumes, which are now recognised as the first books ever to be published with photographic illustrations.

Atkins produced the work over the ten years upto 1853. She distributed it in parts to a number of recipients who then bound the work themselves, meaning each copy differs.

Only eighteen copies exist - in varying states of completeness - held at various institutions including theHorniman Museum and Gardens, The British Library, The Rijksmuseum, The Royal Society and Kew Gardens.

12 March in Slovenia, is Saint Gregory's Day, a version of Saint Valentine's Day, which is celebrated as the start of spring with customs and traditions.

Many of us celebrated a day for love last month with St Valentine's Day on 14 February. But in some countries in Europe, there are more days in which to celebrate love. Today, 12 March, in Slovenia, is Saint Gregory's Day - Gregorjevo - the Slovene Valentine's Day.



St. Gregory was a sixth-century monk who became Pope. Saint Gregory is said to have made many acts of kindness. Today, Saint Gregory is remembered as the patron saint of schoolchildren and scholars.

Originally, Saint Gregory’s day was celebrated on the first day of spring. With the introduction of the Gregorian calendar in 1582, this fell on the 12th of March.

Today is still considered the start of spring. It is said that on this day, birds are joined in wedlock - having found their partner a month before, on Saint Valentine’s Day.

On this day, people hung baked goods in the trees and bushes. These are left-overs from the birds' weddings, which children would search for. In another custom from the past, young women would look up at the sky - the first bird they saw would indicate what type of husband they will marry.

Nowadays there is really only one tradition that is still active. Lights are floated down rivers and other bodies of water, since it is the day when Saint Gregory tosses the light into the water.

Children build miniature boats and houses (called 'gregorčki') for the lights and send them downstream.

What was Monica Zetterlund's first album?

Was Monica Zetterlund in Eurovision?

Swedish singer and actress had a long career which lasted for decades

Swedish singer and actress Monica Zetterlund's long career lasted for several decades, bringing acclaim for her Swedish jazz singing and worldwide cinematic fame.

Zetterlund's musical career began in her teenage years, singing with her father's orchestra in her hometown Hagfors, in western Sweden.

Even though she didn't know the language well at that stage, she learnt the lyrics to English songs by listening.

When she was 21, in 1958, her debut albumSwedish Sensationwas released, one of more than twenty albums she released throughout her career.

After taking the jazz scene by storm in Stockholm, she performed inLondonandNew Yorkwith well-known jazz musicians and artists.

In 1963, she represented Sweden at the Eurovision Song Contest, held in London.

Her song wasEn gång i Stockholm, a slow jazz ballad. This style of music was not very suited to Eurovision, nor popular with the juries. Zetterlund, sadly, did not score any points (the dreadednul points) and came joint-last in the competition.

However, this placing did not unduly affect her career. The 1963Eurovision Song Contestsaw three performers take part, each of whom continued to enjoy successful musical careers despite not winning: Françoise Hardy (who came fifth), Nana Mouskouri (who came eighth) and Monica Zetterlund.

In 1964, she recorded the jazz albumWaltz for Debbywhich was a critical success. Through the preceding decades, as recorded music became more widespread, songs in English from the USA and UK in particular were popular.

Zetterlund had, of course, learned the words to many of these songs.

From then on, Zetterlund sang jazz songs in Swedish, often singing Swedish language covers of popular English language songs. She worked with many popular and successful song-writers and composers.

From the mid-1960s onwards, she began acting in films, television shows and plays.

Her most memorable role was inThe Emigrants, a 1971 film which was nominated for five Academy Awards. It tells the story of emigration from Sweden to the USA in the 1850s. In the film, Zetterlund played Ulrika, a former prostitute who travels to Minnesota with the main characters.

Later in life, she suffered from scoliosis which had developed following a childhood accident, as well as problems with alcohol. In 2005, Monica Zetterlund, aged 67, died tragically in a house fire in Stockholm.

What was Callot Soeurs?

Who were the Callot Soeurs?

One of the most influential and successful fashion houses of the early 20th century founded by four sisters

On Avenue Matignon in Paris, one may notice - or inadvertently step on - a mosaic representing a woman in a light-blue dress beside the words 'Callot Soeurs'.

Commemorating the address of one of their shops, the mosaic keeps the memory of Callot Soeurs alive, one of the most influential and successful fashion houses of the 20th century.

Callot Soeurs was a successful Parisian fashion house between the 1900s and 1920s. Marcel Proust praised them as one of the greatest maisons de couture in his novelÀ la Recherche du Temps Perdu.

The fashion house was founded in 1895 by four sisters: Marie Callot Gerber, Marthe Callot Bertrand, Regina Callot Tennyson-Chantrell and Joséphine Callot Crimont.

They descended from a family of art and textile dealers and were thus accustomed to the precious fabrics, lingerie and laces that their family shops were renowned for.

Their mother was an expert lacemaker. Because of its intricacy and beauty, lace was one of the fabrics that most influenced the sisters' work.

Their couture dresses were made with handmadelace, usually reconstituted in the XVIIIth century. However, they also introduced more innovative fabrics such as gold and silver lamé and an elastic gabardine for their 'sports' couture.

Callot Soeursis also remembered as being among the first designers to abandon the corset for less constrictive silhouettes.

Marie Gerber, the eldest of the sisters, was a talented designer, having trained as apremièrein the atelier of Raudnitz & Cie.

Inspired by the oriental and avant-garde arts, she eventually also designed dresses reminiscent of Cubist influences, made of laces and embroideries resembling collages. She draped fabrics on models and let her toile-makers execute the design.

From 1901 to 1906, one of these toile-makers was no less thanMadeleine Vionnet.

Later, the great couturiére would recognise Callot Soeurs as those who inspired her work. She declared: 'Without the example of the Callot Soeurs, I would have continued to make Fords. It is because of them that I have been able to make Rolls Royces'.

After the death of Marie Berger, the couture house was run by her sons Pierre and Jacques, who continued to sell to themaison's loyal clientele. However, the economic crash of 1929 had a great impact on the business, which was then closed in 1937.

Who was Lucile Grahn?

How did Lucile Grahn become a celebrated ballet dancer?

The first Danish ballerina to become internationally famous and pursue a ballet career

Lucile Grahn, the first Danish ballerina to become internationally famous and pursue a ballet career, danced on some of the most prestigious stages across Europe.

Born in Copenhagen in 1819, Lucina Alexia Grahn was a ballerina, ballet mistress, and choreographer.

She trained at the Royal Danish Theatre School in Copenhagen, where her principal teacher was the ballet master August Bournonville. She made her official debut in 1834.

The following year, she created the leading role inValdemar. Together with Bournonville, she travelled to Paris in 1834 to see Marie Taglioni inLa Sylphide.

Upon their return toDenmark, they produced their own version.

Following successful productions and collaboration between Bournonville and Grahn, Soon differences appeared in the relationship between Bournonville and Grahn, as she wanted to dance at the famed Paris Opéra Ballet.

In 1839, Grahn eventually ended her position at the Royal Theatre in Copenhagen and moved toParis.

Within a few years, Grahn had performed multiple roles in the grand opera houses throughout Europe - in Paris, St Petersburg, Milan, Berlin and London.

Grahn became a famed, well-known dancer in her own right, touring throughout Europe. She frequently produced the ballets in which she appeared.

Within twenty years, Grahn had retired from the stage. In 1856, she married the Austrian tenor Friedrich Young.

From 1858 to 1861 she worked as ballet mistress in Leipzig, Germany. Later, from 1869 to 1875, she led the ballet school at the Court Opera in Munich.

Grahn died in 1907, aged 87, and is now remembered as one of the most popular ballerinas of the 19th century.

Legacy and remembrance

The amazing life and work of Florence Nightingale - the mother of modern nursing

Known as 'the lady of the lamp', Florence Nightingale is celebrated as a founder of modern nursing. She used statistics and data visualisation to improve the field of medicine, and was a strong and empathic woman fighting for social reform.

This blog highlights some of the striking objects in Europeana related to Florence Nightingale's life and work.

Nightingale was born into an upper-class Victorian British family. She enjoyed a privileged upbringing, influenced by the extensive social sphere of her family that led to her adopting a liberal-humanitarian and feminist world view.

She travelled extensively throughout Europe and North Africa during her youth.

Even though her family was opposed to her drive to educate herself and become a nurse, Nightingale went her own way by continuing her travels, becoming a political advisor and receiving medical training in Germany.

She is perhaps best known for her role in the aid of the wounded and sick in the Crimean War.

In 1854, Nightingale left for Crimea together with other volunteer nurses and medical staff. Florence arrived at a military barracks in Scutari, where she found patients in horrible conditions caused by lack of resources and hygiene.

There, she began to implement measures to improve the hygiene in the barracks and reduce mass infections.

Nightingale wrote to The Times in England to ask for financial aid in the improvement of conditions for patients, and called on the Sanitary Commission to provide sewage systems and other improvements to sanitation.

Florence Nightingale's work in the Crimean War received extensive coverage in the British press, which aided her efforts and made her a well-known figure.

An article in The Times described her in passing as 'the lady with the lamp', referring to how she made the rounds at night holding an oil lamp to check on the sick and wounded.

For her work and dedication during the Crimean War, Florence Nightingale received a brooch from Queen Victoria, referred to as the 'Florence Nightingale Jewel'.

Nightingale and Queen Victoria maintained written correspondence during the Crimean War, convincing the Queen to reform the military hospital system in 1857.

After her work in Scutari, she continued fighting for hospital reform and social justice back in the United Kingdom.

In 1855, a  fund was established to found the Nightingale Training School at St. Thomas' Hospital in London - the first school for nursing to be founded worldwide. Nurses that trained there went on to start their own schools for nursing around the United Kingdom and Europe.

Florence Nightingale wrote several books and treatises on nursing and medical science. Her most influential writing isNotes on Nursing, a practical guide to ensure hygiene and health and safety standards in hospitals and by nursing staff.

It is often seen as the foundation of the modern nursing profession.

Throughout her life, Nightingale wrote about 200 books, pamphlets and articles.

From 1857 onwards, she became increasingly bed-bound, but was still extremely productive in her writing efforts, furthering the fields of medical care and increasingly focusing on social reform and feminism. Most of Nightingale's written work was created in her house in Embley Park.

Championed as the founder of modern nursing, at the forefront of the fight for free universal access to healthcare, and an inspiration to the women's right's movement, today several hospitals are named after Nightingale and multiple statues have been erected in her honour.

Her likeness and legacy has appeared on coins, banknotes and postage stamps.

Since 1965, International Nurses Day has been celebrated annually on 12 May, Florence Nightingale's birthday.

Several theatre plays, books, documentaries, TV series and films have been created about her work and life.

2020 was the bicentenary of Florence Nightingale's birth. A series ofevents and exhibitionsacross Europe were planned to celebrate her legacy. The WHO declared 2020 as the year of the Nurse and Midwife.

Swedish artist Åke Waldemar Larsson has created a huge number of artworks depicting day to day life in the city of Malmö, and the beauty, energy and rhythms of our working lives.

Day to day life happens around us - we often don't stop to notice everyday moments: the beauty, energy and rhythms of our working lives.

This is truly not the case for Swedish artist Åke Waldemar Larsson who has created a huge number of artworks depicting day to day life in the city of Malmö.

Born in 1913, he studied at the Skånska painting school in Malmö. His artworks use many different techniques and materials: he drew with charcoal, pencil and wax, as well as painting with oils and gouache.

His artworks are true portraits of a place: showing the urban, everyday realism of life in a northern European city, its streets, buildings and the lives of its population.

We've selected a few images here - showing shops, businesses, bustling city streets and portraits of people.

The artist, who died in 1995, left his entire collection of more than 2000 works to Malmö Museums, who were able to sell a portion to raise funds to care for the rest and share with the public - more than 1300 have been digitised and shared on Europeana.

With the mass movements of the Jewish diaspora to Israel from Europe and beyond, familes brought their stories, trinkets, customs and photographs. This blog presents a selection of photographs from The Israel Museum that points to the stories of migration

The Israel Museum, Jerusalem is one of the largest cultural institutions in Israel providing a backdrop for Israeli heritage, culture, identity and history as communicated through objects, images and exhibitions. Central to this history is the story of migration.



Migration describes the movement from one region to another, often implying a sense of improvement from the condition of one place to the next. This sense of development extends to Jewish migration; as seen by the diaspora of Jewish communities making Aliyah (ascending) to their ancestral Land of Israel. The idea of ‘rising up’ from the depth of social fractures towards togetherness is implicit.

With the mass movements of the diaspora to Israel from Europe and beyond, Jews brought their families, stories, trinkets, customs and photographs to the Promised Land. he Israel Museum is home to a photographic collection that reveals these stories of migration from the Jewish diaspora.

EXPLORE MORE:Migration journeys gallery

The collection speaks of the hardships embedded in migration, as seen in the farewells, reunions, and adaptation to new cultures and languages. These photographs touch on universal qualities within the migrant experience, extending beyond the Jewish history, herein describing migration to be an experience of extreme solitude but also togetherness - as seen in Tim Gidal’sHebrew Lesson.It is also described as physically strenuous as inCornfield,and perhaps Man Ray describes the migrant’s experience to be physically isolating as in his Untitled image of Notre Dame in Paris, France.

Tim Gidal’sBerlin(1929) describes migration purely by the directionless movement of people. Their destination or point of departure is unknown - highlighting the notion of movement in migration instead of foreignness. Gidal’s work draws on larger questions: at which moment does movement translate to migration? At which geographical line or linguistic barrier, does one become known as ‘foreign’?

We return to these images as they speak to the Jewish experience but also an inextricable human quality around what it means to be foreign, and at which point we see ourselves or our environment as such.

One may too consider these photographs a means by which we remember our common humanity, considering that we all return home or become foreign depending on how we perceive the border we cross.

Origins

Carnival costumes

Carnival spectacle

Carnival as cultural heritage

This carnival banishing winter is one of Hungary’s oldest and most famous carnival traditions

Carnival traditions which banish winter and welcome spring can be found across Europe. Hungary’s oldest and most famous, 'Busó-walking' in Mohács starts today, with around 1000 people taking part.

'Busó-walking', a world-famous folk tradition of theŠokacpopulation in Mohács, a town in southern Hungary, was first recorded at the end of the 18th century.

According to the legend, the native Šokac people had escaped from Mohács town to the moorland of Mohács Island to avoid Ottoman troops. Returning to the town at night, they crossed the Danube in boat, and, dressed in terrifying masks and making noise with instruments, they drove the Ottoman troops from the town.

There is probably little truth in the story - Mohács was liberated from the Ottoman rule in 1687, and the migration of the Šokci started about ten years afterwards. Presumably, the Balkan Šokci brought this tradition, which was further formed in Mohács to today’s celebration.

In the parade, busós are men wearing carved wooden masks, moccasins, white linen trousers stuffed with straw, sheepskin coats with their fur outside, tied at the waist by a rope or chain, on which sheep bells hang.

They carry bags on their shoulders, and hold rattles or wooden maces in their hands. Other objects found in the carnival are decorated weights (praćak), water carriers (obramenica) and a Busó puppet which is carried in a wooden tub.

The most important element of the Busó costume is a wooden mask with sheepskin hood, carved from willow and traditionally painted with animal blood. The 'pretty Busós' are girls and boys dressed in Šokac folk wear and their faces are veiled.

Another costumed figure, jankeles are boys dressed in ragged clothes, who cover their faces with rags or stockings and carry bags stuffed with ash, flour or rags. They hit spectators – mainly girls – with the bags.

In Mohács, veiled women and men in nuptial clothes and other people in carnival dresses are called 'maskara' (masqueraders).

Busó-walking (also called 'poklade') has today lost many of the original traditions, but has gained a lot of spectacle for tourists to enjoy.

Spectators should know that the usual moral rules do not apply to Busós, Jankeles and masqueraders during the carnival procession. During the event, there is a special 'suspended' state, often especially at girls’ and women’s expense.

The modern Busó-walking starts on the square that was named after Kóló, the Šokac dance. The disguised Busós, Jankeles and masqueraders gather here and meet other Busó groups, who have crossed over the Danube by boats. When the ancient cannon fires, the different groups walk into the main square of Mohács through the main street, where the carnival begins.

After this, a noisy carnival is celebrated on the bank of the Danube and in the neighbouring streets. At dusk, the groups return to the main square, dance around a huge bonfire and the streets clamour with people.

On the closing day of the carnival – on Shrove Tuesday – the people of Mohács burn a coffin representing winter on a bonfire on the main square. By dancing around the fire, they say goodbye to winter and welcome spring.

Tourists visiting Mohács at other times of the year do not have to miss the experience of Busó-walking, because a cultural centre, Busóudvar, was opened a few years ago.

The museum introduces visitors to the centuries-old carnival tradition, giving a taste of its unique atmosphere and an insight into the local craftsmen’s activities related to the event.

In 2009, the UNESCO added Busó-walking of Mohács to theRepresentative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, the first from Hungary. In 2012, the Committee for Hungarikums designated the tradition as having national value.

Explore the myths and reality of this famous figure

Saint Valentine was a 3rd century Christian martyr, officially recognised by the Roman Catholic Church, whose feast day is 14 February. However, we know litte for certain about his life. Way back in 496,Pope Gelasius Idescribed Valentine’s life and acts as “being known only to God.”

Valentine’s identity is uncertain. Some accounts say that Valentine was a physician and temple priest who ministered to Christians. Others identify him as the Bishop of Interamna (Terni in modern Italy), or a Christian martyr who died in north Africa. Might these overlapping accounts be referring to the same person? We can’t be sure.

It seems likely that Valentine was imprisoned in Rome for aiding persecuted Christians and sentenced to death by Emperor Claudius. Although the year of his execution is uncertain (perhaps 269, 270, 273 or 280), Valentine’s body was interred on 14 February in a Christian cemetery on Rome’s Via Flaminia. Since 496, 14 February has been observed as the Feast of Saint Valentine (Valentine’s Day).

Relics of Saint Valentine can be found all over Europe: a flower-crowned skull in Rome’s Basilica of Santa Maria, a vessel of Valentine's blood in Dublin’s Whitefriar Street Church, and assorted other relics in the Czech Republic, Poland, Malta, France and Scotland.

Valentine is the patron saint of lovers, beekeepers and epileptics. In the image below, we see him blessing an epilectic man who has fallen at his feet. Epilepsy has been known as the "falling sickness" and Valentine's patronage of epileptics may be due to the similarity between his name and the German word for “fall” (epilepsy is known asfallende SuchtorFallsuchtin German).

In this fragment of a book illustration, Saint Valentine is portrayed as a bishop with amonstrance, makes a blessing gesture of healing over a stricken man lying on his back.

In the Middle Ages, it was widely believed that birds paired as couples in February, and Saint Valentine’s association with love may have begun with the medieval English poetGeoffrey Chaucer. Chaucer’s 1375 poemParlement of Fouleslinks St. Valentine’s feast day of 14 February with the tradition of courtly love:

For this was sent on Seynt Valentyne’s day,Whan every foul cometh ther to choose his mate.

Although the life of Saint Valentine may be obscure to us now, the legacy of this famous saint lives on today.

Preserves and shares the rich history of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities

Created by Orla Egan, the Cork LGBT Archive preserves and shares the rich history of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities in Cork, Ireland’s second city and largest county.

Community archives, like the Cork LGBT Archive, aim to preserve histories that so often are absent and invisible in traditional archives, museums, historiographies and heritage institutions.

These previously hidden histories have recently been added to Europeana, as well as being accessible onwww.corklgbtarchive.comand theDigital Repository of Ireland- an important step towards the inclusion and recognition of LGBT history as an important and valuable part of our history and heritage.

In many ways the 1970s were a challenging time to be lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender in Cork – the LGBT community faced criminalisation, discrimination, ignorance, condemnation and violence. However the 1970s also saw the beginnings of LGBT community development in Cork, with the creation of LGBT spaces, services and supports and the LGBT community actively campaigning for social and legal changes.

The first Gay Centre in Cork opened in 1976. Prior to the opening of the Gay Centre, LGBT social networks had developed, with acircuit of ‘fabulous gay parties’around Cork and gatherings in a number of pubs including The Imperial Hotel, Le Chateau and The Steeple.

The Cork Branch of the Irish Gay Rights Movement was established in 1975. The Cork Gay Centre, on MacCurtain Street, provided an important base for the Cork LGBT community. Social events were held each weekend, newsletters were produced and a telephone helpline, Tel-A-Friend, was established.

The Irish transgender organisation, Friends of Eon, was established in Dublin in the 1970s, with members from all around Ireland. A weekly social club, Lola’s Club, ran from 1977 to the mid 1980s.

The first Irish National Gay Conference was held in Cork in 1981, bringing together LGBT activists from Ireland, UK and USA. A series of workshops were held and forty-nine motions were passed at the conference. These motions set the agenda for LGBT activism in the coming decades in Ireland.

In 1982, the Quay Co-op was established as a workers’ co-operative, bringing together LGBT activists, women’s groups, left-wing organisations, environmental and peace groups. The Quay Co-op became a hive of social activism in Cork especially in the 1980s. A Women’s Place was established as part of the Quay Co-op providing an important base for the development of lesbian and feminist groups and supports.

Loafers Bar opened in 1983 and operated until 2015, making it one of the longest running LGBT bars in Ireland. Loafers became an important social space for the Cork LGBT community and for social change activists. The back bar of Loafers was reserved for women on Thursday nights, providing a regular meeting space for Cork’s lesbian and bisexual communities.

ThisHistoric Victoryarticle was published in the Munster Gay Community News, a four-page supplement, produced in Cork, for the national Newspaper.

The first Irish LGBT float in a St. Patrick’s Day Parade was in Cork in 1992. It was organised partly in response to the banning of ILGO (Irish Lesbian and Gay Organisation) from marching in St. Patrick’s Day Parades in New York and Boston. It was also an opportunity for greater visibility for the Cork LGBT community. The Cork LGBT Float won a prize for the Best New Entry in the Cork St. Patrick’s Day Parade that year.

The evolution of Greek bridal couture

Bridal dresses in traditional Greek culture are colourful, rich and vary a lot, depending on the region, the climate, available sources for textiles, as well as local traditions.



The one thing they have in common is over-accessorising: jewels and complex embroideries cover the whole body. Apart from the obvious decorative purpose and the indication of the family’s wealth, these decorations carried strong symbolism. Wishes for abundance and fertility were carried by symbols such as pomegranates, birds and boats (in particular in island cultures), and other symbols such as crosses, colorful stones and two-headed eagles had an apotropaic role, guarding the young bride from evil.

Unlike modern romantic love, for most of history, weddings were closer to a business deal, in which two families joined forces for a beneficial arrangement or alliance.

Wedding dresses were chosen to present the bride’s family in the best light, in terms of wealth and social status. It was expected for them to carry all these symbols and messages through decorations, layering, colours and fabrics.

In traditional Greek culture, each costume contains messages that are known and interpreted by members of the community to indicate if a woman is single or married, newly-wed, has children or is a widow.

An example of this complex semiology are the 40+ motifs decorating Thracian Sarakatsani costumes. Any combination of these motifs indicates not only the place of origin, but also social status, profession and detailed marital status.

For the most special occasions in women’s lives, their wedding, bridal costumes were made by hand, using the best and rarest luxurious fabrics available, depending on the region.

In urban areas, they preferred gold, while in villages they went overboard with colour, with a particular emphasis on red. The bridal costume had a lot of layers and its materials usually included wool, which is pretty heavy.

Together with the headdress, the silver or gold-plated belt and the assortment of jewelry, the costume would weigh around 30 kilos, probably making the 'special day' a very uncomfortable experience for the bride.

The 'metaphysical' aspect of the bridal costume is mainly concentrated on the headband and the shirt: the excessively decorated headband is believed to bring happiness and good fortune and traditionally is a gift of the groom or the mother-in-law.

Because the shirt comes into direct contact with the naked body, it absorbs a power as a form of 'touch magic', gaining most of the magical properties. For this reason, it is often traditionally red and is purified by a priest in church.

Sometimes, aspects of the bridal costume originate back to ancient times, such as the Roumlouki region, where the style of the headdress is supposed to date from the time of Alexander the Great. Tradition has it that he honoured women for their courage as helpers in battle by letting them wear his warriors’ helmets.

Everything was made special for that day, not only underwear, but also towels, pillows and bed linen, sleeping gowns.

The colour white begins to be introduced in the early 1920s, in the form of a veil worn over the traditional headband.

This addition may be a distant echo of the white wedding dress introduced in Europe after Queen Victoria's marriage, who made this unusual choice at a time when colours were more the trend. Queen Victoria wrote about her wedding dress in her journal: "I wore a white satin dress, with a deep flounce of Honiton lace, an imitation of an old design. My jewels were my Turkish diamond necklace & earrings & dear Albert's beautiful sapphire brooch."

Wearing white was quickly adopted by fashionable brides in Britain and Europe and was thought to symbolise purity and virginity.

Pythagoras is a name familiar to many of us. The theory which bears his name - that the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of squares of the lengths of other two sides of the right-angled triangle - is something most of us learn in school.

But how many of us know the story of the man behind the theory?

This blog looks at the biography of the philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras.

As none of Pythagoras' original writing have survived, much of his life is based on other people's writings and legends.

Pythagoras was born around 570 BCE on the Greek island of Samos, off the coast of modern Turkey, where he spent his early years.

Greek city-states and colonies were then established in the countries around the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. Greek merchants, travellers and athletes easily journeyed around the region, spreading art and culture with them.

As a young man Pythagoras travelled around the Middle East. Like many other Greek philopsophers, Pythagoras was said to have studied in Egypt. It is tempting to see how the pyramids may have inspired his study of geometry.

Around the age of 40, Pythagoras moved to Croton, in what is now southern Italy, where he founded a school or scientific-religious sect.

Members were said to be sworn to secrecy and lived a communal, ascetic lifestyle, with an emphasis on numbers and mathematics.

It is said that, after encountering rebellion and resistance in Croton, Pythagoras and his followers fled to nearby Metapontum where he died around 495 BCE.

Beyond his famous theory, Pythagoras is credited with many mathematical and other discoveries. Classical historians now debate whether Pythagoras made these discoveries, and many of the accomplishments credited to him likely originated earlier or were made by his colleagues or successors.

When did Piet Mondrian move to Amsterdam?

When did Piet Mondrian move to Paris?

Why did Mondrian leave Europe?

How Dutch artist Piet Mondrian's migration to Paris, London and New York was reflected in his art

Piet Mondrian is a celebrated Dutch artist, a pioneer of 20th century abstract art that the Netherlands is rightly proud of. But, in addition to being lauded as a Dutch artist, Mondrian could also be celebrated as an artist of Paris, London or New York.

Mondrian migrated several times. His style of art changed throughout his life, growing more abstract, coinciding with his movements and migrations to cities across Europe and the USA.

This blog will look at the life of Piet Mondrian with a special focus on his migration and his artworks.

Pieter Mondriaan was born in Amersfoort in 1872. In his early years, he was inspired by his creative family. His uncle Frits was a landscape artist and designer who taught him painting, while his father encouraged him to become a drawing teacher.

In 1892, Mondrian moved to Amsterdam to study at the Rijksacademie where he produced his first works as an artist. He often painted scenery aroundAmsterdam, and became known as a landcape painter.

In 1911, Mondrian moved to Paris, dropping an 'a' from his surnmame Mondriaan, to signal his departure from the Netherlands.

While inParis, Mondrian became more aware of modern artists, including Diego Rivera and the Cubist style of Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. These inspired him to change his painting style. He began to paint with a more limited colour palette.

During 1914, Mondrian returned to the Netherlands to visit his ill father. Mondrian could not return to Paris becauseWorld War Ibroke out. He was forced stay in the Netherlands for the duration of the war.

During this period, Mondrian, along with a number of other artists including Theo van Doesburg, founded De Stijl (The Style), an artistic movement promoting abstraction. De Stijl artworks were simplified to vertical and horizontal compositions, using only black, white and primary colours.

Mondrian returned to Paris in 1919. By 1920, Mondrian's now-famous grid paintings began to appear.

However, his paintings were initially not popular and did not sell well.

By the late 1930s, however, abstract art had become more accepted, and Mondrian was considered one of the foremost abstract artists.

In 1938, with Nazi Germany on the rise, Mondrian left Paris forLondon.

After the the Netherlands was invaded and Paris fell in 1940, he left London for Manhattan.

Mondrian and his work became much more famous after his arrival inNew York.

Since his days in Paris, Mondrian collected jazz records. In New York, Mondrian embraced the city's life to the full.Victory Boogie Woogie, often considered his unfinished masterpiece, reflects the vibrancy of New York life, Manhattan's grid-like street structure and the rhythms of jazz music.

Mondrian died in New York in 1944, aged 71. Since his death, his paintings have become more famous, inspiring further artworks and Mondrian's place as a master of modernist art has been secured.

Reflecting the movement of Asian people and culture across the world

Lunar New Year celebrations are about to start. As we live in an interconnected world, where the cultures spread and mix in different places, you do not have to be in Asia to join the festivities.

These eight facts will help you better understand what this big yearly festival is all about.

Chinese New Year, also known as Chinese New Year or Spring Festival, is determined by the lunisolar calendar which is based on the phases of the moon.

This means when converted to the Gregorian calendar we use in everyday life, the date of the Lunar New Year changes each year, but always falls between January 21 and February 20. Starting on February 10 2024 and ending on January 29 2025, 2025 is the year of the Dragon.

Unlike the Western astrology zodiac, where the specific signs are assigned to months, Chinese Zodiac has signs assigned to whole years. This means a different animal is associated with each Chinese year.

Lunar New Year decorations are usually red as red is China’s lucky colour.

They’re abundant and exist in different forms, all of them having a meaning. Lanterns - hanging on the streets, building and trees - are there to drive off bad luck.

Door couplets come in pairs (this is where the name comes from) are placed on both side of the doors and contain good wishes.

The Chinese character Fu means good luck and happiness. Signs depicting this character are often placed upside down in the belief that in this way, the good fortune will descend down on their house.

Mandarine oranges or tangerines symbolise abundance and prosperity. These are not only used as a decoration, but also given as a gift to friends and family.

Red envelopes or red packets contain money are given as gifts, traditionally to transfer wealth from the older to younger generations.

This means children and young people receive them from their parents, grandparents and other older and more established family members. But they can also be given to friends and employees. And similarly to other things going digital, the red envelopes now also exist in an electronic version.

Lunar New Year is a very long festivity, so there are various ways to celebrate.

Many people visit friends and family to share a meal and exchange gifts. Many people travel from far away (including abroad) for a family reunion, making the Lunar New Year the biggest human migration in the world.

Additionally to family celebrations, street parades and open-air markets where people enjoy the festive atmosphere, buy food and flowers are very popular.

The street celebrations include a popular performance of the dragon dance.

The dragon is a symbol of wisdom, power and good luck. Performing the dragon dance is believed to chase away the bad spirits and bring luck to the community.

When meeting someone during the Lunar New Year period, people wish each other luck, health and good fortune. Greeting cards - either paper or electronic - are sent to those who can't be together during the festivities.

We’re finishing this list with 8 and it’s for a reason.

In Chinese culture, numbers have special meanings. 8 is the lucky number, together with 6 and 9 while 4 is considered unlucky. Good to know when filling the red envelope!

Beautiful landscapes from the 'Golden Age of Finnish art'

Nature and the natural world has inspired many artists across Europe, with flora, fauna, landscapes and weather frequently depicted in artworks.

Finnish painter Eero Järnefelt was one such artist inspired by nature. Over his artistic career of more than 60 years, his many paintings depict details of nature and weather in particular in Finland.

Erik (Eero) Nikolai Järnefelt was born in 1863, and later studied in Helsinki and Paris. He taught art at the University of Helsinki and was chairman of the Finnish Academy of Fine Arts.

While, since the 1890s, Järnefelt was known as one of Finland’s most notable portrait painters, he also painted smaller nature-themed pieces and landscapes, many of which became symbols of Finland's nationalist politics.

He regularly visited the area around Koli National Park in eastern Finland, inspiring many landscape paintings. Several paintings feature studies of clouds and cloud-filled skies.

Today, Eero Järnefelt's art is celebrated and found in many museums in Finland and around the world. He is celebrated as a leading figure in 'the Golden Age of Finnish art', an era which lasted from the late 19th century to the early 20th century.

Laments of Irish emigrants

Xenitia: Greeks abroad

Saudade: Portuguese longing

Music can evoke memories, transporting us to another time and place.

Migration and music are intrinsically linked, mirroring the movement of people from place to place and country to country. Musical styles have been influenced by migration, with communities telling their migration stories through music.

This blog looks at how folk music has reflected migration, introducing examples from Ireland, Greece and Portugal.

Emigration for economic, political and social reasons has been a part of Irish life throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.

People left Ireland largely for other English-speaking countries such as United Kingdom, United States, Australia, Canada with smaller numbers settling in other countries like Argentina, India and European nations.

Hundreds of folk songs express the sentiments of those who left Ireland through lyrics put to the air of traditional songs, taken by emigrants as they crossed the seas.

Some reference events in the country’s turbulent history, such as The Great Famine and British rule; others are very personal, speaking of loved ones, childhood memories and the glorious Irish landscape.

On Europeana, you can listen toA Stór Mo Chroí,I'm Leaving Tipperary,Cliffs of Doneen,The Arranmore Disaster- all of which are on the theme of migration.

As many Greeks migrated to seek their fortune in other countries, migration is a common theme in Greek folk songs.

Songs dating to the period of the Ottoman rule contain lyrics full of melancholy, reflecting the deep sorrow and the great pain of the person who is leaving, and also of those that stay behind.

The protagonist of these songs is always a man, unfolding an often tragic tale: as most migrants were expected to never return, moving away was considered an equivalent to death. In many of these songs migrants are compared with migratory birds, vulnerable travellers.

On Europeana, you can hear these songsΞενιτεμένο μου πουλίandΞένος κι αν πάει στην ξενιτιά.

The songs also express the feelings of the people that remain behind. The mother appears in many songs -  however this is not the case for the wife. Thus, the songs have a strong patriarchal connotation.

No word features more often thanxenitia(Ξενιτιά), which could be defined as “becoming a stranger” or “abroad-ness”, with all the cultural implications that might have.

The musical genrefadohas become famous as a symbol of Portugal.

From its origins in the early 1800s, fado music and lyrics have been associated with sadness, melancholia and remembering. The mournful music, often about the sea or the life of the poor, express feelings of nostalgia and longing.

Emotions surrounding emigration are in keeping with these themes.

On Europeana, you can listen to the songFado do Emigrante, sung by António Menano, which exemplifies this. The lyrics describe the feelings of leaving the land where the singer was born, and the emotional reaction to distance and homesickness.

Adeus terra onde eu nasciE onde vivi tão felizAdeus olhos que dizeisCoisas que a boca não diz

Goodbye land where I was bornAnd where I lived so happyGoodbye eyes that you sayThings the mouth doesn't say

Singer, António Menano, was one of the best known and most famous singers from Coimbra, in particular as his music was recorded.

RELATED:Listen to more songs by António Menano

Menano himself spent some of his life outside Portugal - working as a doctor in Mozambique from 1993 onwards. He returned to Portugal 28 years later.

In these three examples, we see how music and migration both influence and inspire each other, and how the rhythms and movement of people is reflected in the lyrics and notes of folk music across Europe.

This blog post is a part of theMigration in the Arts and Sciencesproject, which explored how migration has shaped the arts, science and history of Europe.

From crimes of passion and criminal gangs, explore these true crime stories about trials and criminals in early 20th century France

Crime fiction is one of the most successful book genres in Europe - people are fascinated by dark stories about murder, crime and detectives. Stories about crime and criminals in early 20th century France can be found in our collections, so prepare to read some true crime stories!



This gang “La bande à Bonnot” terrorised the French middle-classes during the Belle Epoque, in 1912 and 1913.

They were an anarchist group of men and women who used new technology for their robberies and thefts that weren’t available to the police yet, such as repeating rifles and cars. They were the first gang ever to use a get-away car, and became known as ‘the auto bandits’ by the French press.

These advantages lead to them mocking the police, even going as far as sending them their fingerprints - a technique the French police were not using at that time.

EXPLORE MORE:Photographs and paintings about la bande a Bonnot

Their most prominent member was Jules Bonnot, an anarchist from Northern France, who was shot in 1913 trying to escape from the police.

During their trial in 1913, most of the members were sentenced to death.

That we can actually see photographs of criminals is due to this man: Alphonse Bertillon. He invented the genre of the mug shot only a few years earlier in 1900.

The term mugshot actually dates back to the 18th century, derived from an English slang word for face. Although mug shots were taken earlier in Belgium, US and UK, in 1888 Bertillon standardised the angles and procedure of how criminals were portrayed.

He was frustrated with how criminals were identified and the high rate of repeat offenders in France. So he invented several techniques to enable the French police to better identify and capture criminals. In addition to the mugshot, he also found ways to use foot prints, ballistics and forensic techniques to capture criminals.

Trials are a fundamental right in European democratic law. But some of them attract more public attention than others.

The trial of Henriette Caillaux was one such. Though they were both married, the French Minister of Finance and Henriette had an affair. Having divorced and later married in 1911, they became one of France’s wealthiest couples.

When her husband was put under pressure by journalist Gaston Calmette because of political issues, she feared that he would publish love letters proving they had had an affair while married. The only possible solution that she saw was her husband challenging him in a duel to save his reputation, she decided to act herself.

Waiting for Calmette in his newspaper's offices, she pulled an automatic pistol out of her fur muff and shot him dead. She waited calmly for the police to arrive, refusing to be driven by them to the police station. She preferred to be taken there by her own chauffeur.

During her trial, many of the most powerful members of French society were present. Her lawyer persuaded the jury that her uncontrollable female emotions resulted in this crime, which she didn’t deny.

She was acquitted in 1914 and continued her life, even publishing a book and received a diploma from the École du Louvre.

Let's take a tour, illustrated with digitised cultural heritage collections from around Europe and discover some interesting connections.

Galway, in Ireland, and Rijeka, in Croatia, are the European Capitals of Culture for 2020.

Both cities have a wide range of cultural activities planned throughout 2020. As their year-long celebrations begin, let's take a tour of both cities illustrated with digitised cultural heritage collections from around Europe and discover some interesting connections.

Galway, a city of around 80,000 people, is located on the west coast of Ireland, facing the Atlantic Ocean. Similarly, Rijeka, a city of almost 130,000 people, is situated by the waters of the Adriatic Sea. Both cities are important harbours, on Galway Bay and Rijeka Bay.

Their maritime histories are important to both cities. Galway, and the west coast of Ireland generally, is known for the currach wooden-framed boat. Rijeka is home to large shipbuilding yards.

Both cities are home to cultural celebrations. Galway has celebrated the Galway Arts Festival since 1978, with Rijeka's International Carnival taking place since 1982.

Galway and Galway Bay have been immortalised through many traditional Irish songs - listen here.

Claddagh rings origins lie in Galway. Named for a fishing village in the county of Galway, a Claddagh ring features two hands holding a heart wearing a crown. The hands represent friendship, the heart represents love and the crown represents loyalty.

Rijeka is home to the Croatian National Theatre Ivan pl. Zajc, a theatre and opera house which opened in 1885, named after composer Ivan Zajc who was born in Rijeka.

Both Galway and Rijeka are home to many beautiful views, buildings and impressive architecture. Let's take a look at sights and views of both cities.

Explore objects relating to braille writing system found in museums, libraries and archives' collections across Europe.

Developed in the 19th century, braille is a writing system used by people with visual impairments.

Named after its creator Frenchman Louis Braille, who lost his sight in a childhood accident, braille is read by touch, with raised dots embossed on paper.

Louis Braille first unveiled his writing system in 1824, and revised it in 1837. Although not universally adopted during his life, it has been in use since, and has been adapted for languages worldwide.

Braille has been an important tool in the education and employment for those with visual impairments. This blog explores a number of objects relating to braille found in museums, libraries and archives' collections across Europe.

Both the photographs above and below are from the National Library of France. The photograph above shows a book written in braille from 1837, and the photograph below shows a sculpture bust of Louis Braille.

This photograph, from the National Archives of Catalonia, shows students learning to read braille in a classroom of Casal de Cegues Pi i Margall, in Barcelona.

This brass tool, from the Tekniska museet in Stockholm, was used for embossing braille into documents.

This typewriter-like apparatus, from Sörmlands museum's collection, created documents in braille. The typewriter was manufactured in West Germany, during the post-war period when the country was occupied by Great Britain, the United States, France and the Soviet Union. The text 'Made in the US zone of Germany' is printed on the device, meaning it likely dates to the late 1940s.

This is the Standard Perkins Brailler, from the Norwegian Technical Museum's collections. It was designed by David Abraham for Perkins School for the Blind in 1951, it continues to be used worldwide. It embosses 25 lines with 42 cells on a 11" x 11 1/2" sheet of paper.

This pamphlet, part of the Sörmlands museum collections, is from a nursing school in Eskilstuna, Sweden and shows how to denote numbers and punctuation marks in braille.

This binder of maps, from the Skåne region medical history collections, features braille and raised maps allowing blind people to read them.More detailed photographs can be found here.

This booklet, from the Skåne region medical history collections, was published by The Royal National Institute for the Blind in 1959. It was a supplement to a Braille Music Catalogue. As well as numbers and letters, braille also includes music notes and symbols.

The Copa Nadal (Christmas Cup) is a Christmas Day swimming competition in which swimmers race 200 metres in the Old Port of Barcelona.

For many of us, Christmas Day involves a day of rest and relaxation, enjoying gifts and good food. But for some people, Christmas Day involves bracing swim in the sea in wintery waters.



Across Europe, there are several Christmas Day swimming races - one example is Barcelona's Copa Nadal (Christmas Cup) in which swimmers race 200 metres in the Old Port of Barcelona.

The event has taken place for more than 100 years. The first edition should have taken place on 26 December 1907 but was postponed due to bad weather until January 1908. It has since taken place every year, except in 1936 to 1938 during the Spanish Civil War.

Organised by the Barcelona Swimming Club, the race is free and open to people of all ages, competing in different age categories.

Only men took part in the first editions, with women competing since 1928. One man, Dani Serra, has won the race 10 times. Carmen Soriano is the woman who has won the race the most, winning it six times in the 1930s.

Remembering my friend Ruxandra

Return to Romania after 1989

Fire at University Library of Bucharest

The Romanian Revolution, in December 1989, violently brought an end of 42 years of Communist rule in Romania.

The Romanian Revolution, in December 1989, was a time of civil unrest that led to the trial and execution of Communist Party leader Nicolae Ceaușescu and his wife Elena, and the end of 42 years of Communist rule in Romania.

Revolutions occured in several countries in central and Eastern Europe in 1989. The Romanian revolution was the last of these, and the only one that violently overthrew a government and executed its leader.

In this blog,Cristina Roiuof The Romanian Academy Library remembers the Romanian revolution through experiences and memories shared at a number of Europeana collection days held in Romania.

Every year, as we approach 21 December, I remember the 1989 Romanian Revolution events and the tragic death of my young friend Ruxandra.

And I also remember how content I was when the Europeana 1989 project came to Romania in 2014 and offered me the possibility to tell her story, a quarter of a century after her death.

For me, telling her story during the Europeana 1989 Collection Day in Bucharest was very necessary - to prove that her sacrifice was not forgotten and that we still remember her.

We gathered then many more stories of people who died young fighting for their freedom. The entire team digitising these stories were young people who didn’t know anything about the events of December 1989 or the communist times. The Europeana 1989 campaign in Bucharest was a very useful inter-generational conversation.

During our [Europeana Migration Collection Day in Sibiu] in 2018, we discovered the touching story of Maria Luise who emigrated to Germany but returned to Romania right after the 1989 Romanian Revolution.

'I emigrated from Romania to Germany in the year 1969, taking with me as important treasures these ‘letters’ sewn onto pieces of canvas, which reminded me of the hardest time of my life,' began Maria Luise.

Between 1958 and 1964, I endured the regime of the communist prisons in Romania for the guilt 'of having received a letter from a person in Germany’.

I remember the extremely hard life in prisons, where you had nothing, not even a piece of paper or a pencil to write a few lines to your loved ones. There were times of complete censorship and control from the communist authorities. I still managed to send some messages to my mother, letters ‘sewn’ with red thread on some textile pieces cut from my white shirt. The thread came from my blouse and the needle was borrowed from the ‘Men's Room’.

After the revolution in 1989, Maria Luise returned to Romania. She says, 'Right after the events of December 1989 in Romania, I decided to turn back to my country.  My friends and relatives in Germany could not understand my decision: 'Why come back where you suffered so much?' But I felt I could contribute in my way to the rebirth of my country, so since 1990, I have been living in Sibiu.'

During the December 1989 events, a fire destroyed the historical building of the Bucharest University Library along with over half a million volumes.

Contributing to Europeana 1989 in Bucharest, librarian Victoria Frâncu described the events.

'On 22 December 1989 at night, after sending my children to bed, I went to some neighbors not to be alone. On TV, soon after, I saw the horror! I couldn't believe it was true… The University Library, where I worked, was on fire! The injuries caused by the firefighters to the library seemed irreparable. Why do this? Why make so much culture ash?

On the morning of 23 December, I hardly reached the centre, brought by a car that stopped at my praying signs. From the Palace Plaza, where the car had left me, I walked, passing near the Creţulescu Church, to the library. I climbed the steps from Creţulescu and saw with my eyes the reality on the television. From the tears that flooded my eyes, an amputated building rose in front of me… my workplace didn’t exist anymore.'

Following an appeal of the UNESCO’s General Director Federico Mayor in 1991, donations of over 100,000 volumes were received by the library from individuals and institutions in the country and over 800,000 volumes from abroad.

Photography of Eduards Kraucs documenting the construction of a dam

The construction of the Ķegums Hydropower Plant was one of the greatest achievements of the Latvian state during the interwar period. This blog introduces the photography of Eduards Kraucs whose collection of photographs documenting the construction reflects a unique industrial heritage and Latvian engineering achievements.

The Ķegums Hydropower Plant, launched on 15 October 1939, was one of the most advanced hydro-electric power plants in Europe at that time. On 22 December 1939, a state-owned enterprise Ķegums was established, intended to promote the development of the energy sector and lay the foundations for a unified national electricity supply.

RELATED:Explore this gallery of power plants and other ways we have generated power across Europe

Between August 1936 and July 1940, Latvian cinematographer and photographerEduards Kraucs(1898-1977) documented the construction of the power plant. His photographs demonstrate his contemporary thinking, professionalism and documentary precision.

Kraucs' photographs give us a unique opportunity to see and experience the construction process of the hydropower plant. The photographs pay attention to specific details, as well as the huge and impressive overall view of the building.

Kraucs’ collection of photographs has a dual value. It is a chronological representation of a unique historical event and an outstanding example of his professional photography. His photographs are historically and artistically significant. They give the viewer a sense of being at the very heart of the power plant, its engine room and control panel.

Kraucs' collection of photo negatives on glass plate equally document an unforgettable story in the collective memory of Latvia, attesting to Latvia’s understanding of sustainable development, the professionalism and competence of Latvian engineering and technical specialists, as well as the ability to develop international cooperation.

A second power plant was built between 1976 and 1979, while the plant was totally renovated between 1998 to 2001.

In 2009, Eduards Kraucs’ collection of 1,736 photo negatives on glass plate about the construction of the Ķegums Hydropower Plant (1936-1940) was included in the Latvian National Register of UNESCO Memory of the World Programme, attesting that the collection belongs to the cultural heritage. The collection is stored at the Latvenergo Group Museum of Energy in Latvia.

'An industrial catastrophe unparalleled in scope' where ‘every five minutes someone dies of a disease related to asbestos.’The Asbestos Lie, a report written by investigative journalist Maria Roselli delivers an uppercut to its readers from the very outset.

Despite the fact that the import and use of asbestos have been banned in Europe since 2005, the detrimental effects of the material once considered to be magic are still very much a thing of the present.

More than that: because of the latency of asbestos-induced diseases, the number of people suffering its fatal effects is expected to rise in the years to come.

This frightening prognosis is the result of a century and a half of intensive use.

Asbestos, a naturally occurring mineral, was once highly valued because of its insulating and fireproofing qualities, affordable price and wide availability. It was especially coveted as a construction material, as it is durable and bonds well with many other substances, adding strength and longevity.

In view of the fact that the dangerous effects of asbestos had been known since the 1910s - when American insurance companies refused to cover workers processing the material - it is all the more surprising that a real boom in asbestos products occurred in the 1950s, helped by extensive and effective marketing campaigns.

Asbestos was used for the production of fire-resistant garments, roofing shingles, cement pipes, brake linings, fire protectant sprays, textured paint and vinyl tiles.

Only in the mid-1960s public awareness of its life-threatening effects grew.

By that time, many people had succumbed to asbestos-related illnesses - from lung cancer and asbestosis (scarred lung tissue) to mesothelioma, a tumor encasing the lining of the lungs.

The asbestos epidemic that has since struck hundreds of thousands serves as a gruesome reminder of the fact that the history of ‘Europe at work’ is not only one of success and prosperity. Because asbestos-related diseases are to a large extent ‘industrial diseases’.

For consumers, risks are limited as long as asbestos products remain unharmed. It’s only when the minerals - which consist of thin crystals that break up in microscopic fibrils - get damaged, that inhalation of fibers impacts the human body. Not those using, but those manufacturing the products, therefore, have been exposed most severely to its hazards.

As far as handling the material goes, women working in factories were often responsible for cutting up rolled out asbestos, or beating it into forms with hammers. A well-known case is that of Casale Monferrato in Italy, where hundreds of female workers from the Eternit factory passed away as a consequence of such exposure to asbestos.

But asbestos has also affected homemakers. Female family members of asbestos workers were often responsible for washing the clothes they wore on the job. In the process, they touched and inhaled the fibres, leaving them as vulnerable as their spouses.

Families of victims, health organisations, and investigative journalists such as Maria Roselli have been advocating for years for a worldwide ban on asbestos. Yet three quarters of the members of the World Health Organisation have failed to do so thus far, leaving asbestos to remain the most toxic substance for present-day workers - and their loved ones.

What are the origins of the words denim and jeans?

Denim is a well-known word, linked mostly to clothing, a fabric linked to jeans, a fashion staple. Both words tell a fascinating story about the origins of these icon fabrics and clothing. This blog looks at the history of denim and jeans, from their invention at the end of the 19th century through to the popular clothing of today.

The word ‘denim’ comes from a fabric called ‘Serge de Nimes’, made in the French city of Nimes.

Denim is a type of cotton twill textile; its unique colour is a textured blue, given by the fact that the warp threads passing underneath the weft threads are indigo dyed, while weft threads remain plain white. This is why the fabric has two colours: blue on the outside and white on the inside.

The word 'jeans' comes from the Italian city of Genoa, where another similar fabric was made and called 'jean’.

Genoa's jean fabric was a fustian textile resembling cotton corduroy, used for work clothes thanks to its affordable price and durability. The uniforms of sailors from the Genoese navy, for instance, were made of jeans.

Denim was first produced to imitate jean, but it was of a higher quality and resistance, and therefore it was used for overalls and smocks.

The fabric started being used in the United States at the end of the 18th century, when gold miners needed clothing that could withstand heavy working, without tearing or wearing down. Jeans, more or less as we know them today, were an intelligent invention developed by a businessman and a tailor, Levi Strauss and Jacob Davis.

Their collaboration led to many experimentations, finally finding the right fabric: a particular kind of denim, inspired by the European one, but produced by an American manufacturer. The initial design was simple -  these trousers were soon used by miners, factory workers, farmers and cattlemen.

In 1873 they patented the model, which soon became mass-produced, and featured some fundamental elements: apart from the fabric, jeans had to have two pockets in the front and one on the back, and the places where trousers tended to tear were reinforced with copper rivets.

During the 20th century, designs changed, as well as their cultural significance mostly thanks to cinema.

In the 1930s, denim and jeans became popular thanks to Hollywood cowboy movies. In the 1950s, denim symbolised a desire for young people to be different from their parents. Jeans reached a hip, iconic level being worn by James Dean in the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause. In the 1960s and 1970s, denim and jeans were a symbol of counterculture.

Today, jeans and denim are commonplace, and not just in trousers - one of the most common, flexible, enduring and desirable icons of fashion.

Production on a grand scale

The tale of the Singer company and their world-changing sewing machines is one of industrialisation, emancipation, mass production, mass marketing, and a massive impact on the world.

You might remember the sight of an old steel and wood bench with a sewing machine affixed to it in the house of your parents, grandparents, or somewhere forgotten, collecting dust. Singer sewing machines and their logos and fonts are embedded in the collective mind of many, but how did it end up there in the first place?

EXPLORE:Singer sewing machines in Europeana

The story of Singer starts around 1850, when Isaac Merritt Singer, an American businessman, came up with an idea for improving the current lockstitch design that sewing machines had. He proposed the design for a sewing machine with a shuttle with a straight needle instead of a curved one, that went straight up and down instead of in a circle like previous sewing machines did.

This made the operation of a sewing machine much more reliable, and Singer filed a patent for this new design in 1851.

Singer's sewing machines really took off when they were awarded the first prize at the Paris World Fair in 1855. Singer became the largest selling brand of sewing machines internationally in that year. Singer put a lot of effort into pushing down the cost of producing their sewing machines. The prices of Singer sewing machines were pushed down to 10 dollars in the 1870s (about the equivalent of 280$ in 2018) so they would be affordable to a large group of people.



Singer. Sewing machines in the factory, 1892, Bibliothèque Nationale de France, France, NoC-OKLR

Singer didn't only want to provide sewing machines to textile factories, they wanted to bring sewing machines into the home.

Singer marketed to families by focusing on the image of the virtuous domestic wife repairing and sewing clothes in no time for husband and children alike.

In 1870 they debuted the red "S" logo with a sewing woman in the background, staying in use until at least 1920.

Singer invested heavily in teaching women how to use sewing machines in the home, organising Singer tutorial workshops for women and girls all over the world.

The machines were continuously redesigned to be quicker, easier to use, and lighter. New inventions, like the vibrating shuttle invention of 1885, allowed the Singer Corporation to create their own patents and start mass production.

Lower prices and higher availability of Singer sewing machines meant that the prices of clothing went down drastically, impacting workers relying on sewing for their livelihood.

EXPLORE:Listen to the sound of a Singer sewing machine

At the same time it had emancipating effects, giving women more time for other activities outside the household and enjoy leisure activities or seek employment.

Industrialisation and mass production also brought massive negative consequences, like the proliferation of exploited and oppressed workers in sweatshops, issues that persist to this day.

Singer sewing machines changed the working lives of many in myriad different ways. The stories of seamstresses, sweatshop workers, housewives, and many more are intricately intertwined with the machinery they used in their labour. By looking back at the history of the Singer sewing machine, those stories are surfaced as well.

Europe's first environmental protest?

The Bor mine in Eastern Serbia developed and industrialised rapidly in the 20th century, bringing the development of this region in an unexpected direction. However, the hasty development of the Bor Mine did not result in the growth of working standards.



This blog looks at conditions and protests at the Bor Mine in Serbia, and uncovers what may be one of the first environmental protests in Europe.

In the 1900s, the early years of the mine, the working conditions were very harsh, wages were quite low and workers did not have the necessary machinery. Sulphuric fumes released in the ore-smelting process had a devastating effect on agriculture in the area surrounding Bor.

RELATED:Read blog: The Bor Mine in Serbia: labour and landscape throughout the 20th century

In 1908, all this brought about the first strike, organised by the Social Democratic Party of the time. The strike was quickly quelled and the request to determine the scope of the damage caused by mining fumes to agriculture, directed at the Kingdom of Serbia Ministry of Economy was completely dismissed.

FollowingWorld War I, the spread of socialist ideas throughout the Bor Mine was met with harsh resistance from the authorities. The situation was further aggravated when the Yugoslav Communist Party was banned. The 1920 decree banning the Communist Party also banned general strike calls, which was detrimental to any form of trade unions in the mine.

The period between 1929 and 1933 was particularly harsh as the global economic crisis further influenced labour cost decreases and high unemployment rates impacted the Bor mine.

Union control of this mining basin was also minimised, resulting in widespread environmental pollution. At that time, the local population was faced with the harmful consequences of industrialisation. The smoke coming from mining chimneys brought about nothing but trouble. Acid rains destroyed the land and crops, while the air and water contained sulphur and other metals released in the production process. The mine owners refused to pay the damages caused by the pollution.

However, despite the bans and increased supervision, around 400 local inhabitants gathered outside the Bor police station on 7 May 1935.

Having been ignored by the local authorities, they proceeded to demonstrate their discontent at the mine by interrupting the workflow. They demanded that the Bor Mines authorities make efforts to ensure purification of the smoke coming from the smelter - so as not to affect the land, air and water.

Since their demands continued to be ignored, they gathered again five days later. This time, there were around 4,000 protesters. They also claimed damages for crop failure as well as employment benefits since they were no longer able to continue working in agriculture.

This marked the first environmental protest in the former Yugoslavia and, perhaps, Europe as well.

It was organised by the miners and agriculturalists together, bearing in mind the implications of such an undertaking. Unfortunately, during the protest, around 500 shots were fired at the protesters, resulting in a miner’s death, while another one was seriously wounded and a dozen others were also injured.

RELATED:Explore this gallery of industrial strikes and protests

Following these unfortunate events, the mine authorities made a commitment to install smoke-purification facilities and build a sulphuric acid factory.

Not only did this turn of events in the Bor Mine result in the development of trade union activities, but it also set forth socialist propaganda striving to raise political and environmental protection awareness amongst the workers.

In 1934 and 1935,Đorđe Andrejević Kun, a socially-committed artist, visited the Bor Mine illegally multiple times, portraying the daily lives of the miners. As fate would have it, some of his graphics captured the tragic events of the environmental protest of May 1935.

In 1936, he published his graphics, titledKrvavo zlato(Blood-stained Gold), illegally. Not only was this a revolutionary way of fighting for one’s causes, extending the scope of the influence of art, it also became a call for the future by marking a mine as a possible place of confrontation, both of the class and environmental nature.

Since its founding, the landscape of Bor and the surrounding area have changed completely. The actions of the local population in the 1930s mark a beginning of our awareness of the effects of industry on ecology and landscape, something which, today, is of even greater and more urgent importance.

Tea, coffee and tobacco

The first daylight factory in Europe

Attention to workers’ well being

UNESCO World Heritage

The Van Nelle Factory in Rotterdam grew from a small firm selling coffee, tea and tobacco, to a large factory of steel and glass, the first daylight factory in Europe.

Similar to many large companies, the story of Van Nelle business started with a small shop. In 1782, Johannes van Nelle opened a coffee, tea and tobacco shop at the Leuvehaven in Rotterdam. After the death of the founders, their son continued to run the company, selling a stake to the Van der Leeuw family who took over the entire company in 1845.

Coffee, tea and tobacco became increasingly important around the turn of the century. This contributed to the success of the family Van Der Leeuw who established worldwide trade contracts and founded their own coffee and tea plantations in Dutch West India.

The company distinguished itself by an original business approach, including appealing advertising characters Piggelmee and Tureluur, a couple of dwarfs experiencing various adventures related to coffee. They featured on both packaging and merchandise.

In 1916, the company bought a site close to Schie, a waterway in Rotterdam. The construction of the famous factory took place between 1927 and 1929.

Van Nelle was designed as an ‘ideal factory’ with the modular design making it possible to adjust the space according to functions and needs.

Each of the processed gods - tobacco, coffee and tea used a separate section of the building and its form and size responded to the processing needs. The principal idea was to start by bringing the raw material to the top of the buildings to go down a floor after each stage of the treatment plant.

This explains the difference in heights - the tobacco section consisted of eight, coffee of five and tea of three levels. The characteristic overpasses between the buildings were an efficient way to transport materials between the buildings.

RELATED:See the factory in these photographs of a group visiting in the late 1950s

Instead of bearing walls, concrete pillars were used to support the building. The steel and glass facade opened the factory to the outside world and enabled the workers to take advantage of the daylight.

Allowing the daylight in the building was already an answer to workers’ discontent and an important component of Van Nelle’s attractiveness as a workplace.

The owners valued the well-being of the employee thinking that a happy and proud worker will be more productive. The factory was surrounded by green spaces and water. The facilities were similar to those offered by contemporary start-ups: sports fields for an after-work training, a garden, a dining room and even a library.

The sanitary facilities were excellent for the times. The only way to enter the factory was through gender-segregated staircases, leading to cloakrooms and bathrooms, to ensure the hygiene on the work floor. The availability of showers at the factory was, for the time, an unprecedented luxury.

The factory ceased operations in 1996. A complete restoration began in 1998. Both the architecture of the factory and its structure have been preserved in their original state.

In June 2014, Van Nelle Factory was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. At the moment, the factory houses an office complex, various meeting spaces, a restaurant and a gym. It hosts various events - parties, concerts, vintage markets.

Do you remember your first mobile phone? There’s a good chance it came from a Nordic country, sinceNokiafrom Finland orEricssonfrom Sweden together dominated the global mobile phone market in 2000.



Both firms show how telecommunications evolved in Europe and how Nordic countries belonged to the most innovative producers worldwide. To explore the history of these two major Nordic telecommunication companies, we have to go back to the 19th century.

Outside Finland, most people think of Nokia as a mobile phone company. It actually started in the mid-19th century in a smallFinnish townwith the same name. Nokia’s river was the engine for several industries and businesses, for example paper mills and pulp factories -the first and most important of Finnish industries.

At the turn of the 20th century, rubber and cable industries started to settle in Nokia. There were three major businesses: Suomen Gummitehdas Oy (Finnish Rubber Works Ltd), Nokia Ab (founded as a papermill) and Suomen Kaapelitehdas Oy (Finnish Cable Works Ltd).

For around 100 years, the ‘Nokia’ brand was associated with goods from rubber products (Nokia is well-known for itsrubber bootsin Finland).

In 1967,  the three companies merged, entering the radio and TV market.

At that time, as Finland were neutral in the Cold War and had a trade deal with Russia, Nokia profited heavily from this. In fact, Russia became one of Nokia’s most important markets, trading not only telephone switches, but also robotics and scientific technology.

The company today known as Ericsson had a quite different start. The young SwedeLars Magnus Ericssonstarted working as an instrument maker, but soon switched to telegraphs. His first business he founded was a 13 square metre repair shop for telegraphs in Stockholm in 1876. That was the same year whenAbraham Graham Bellpatented the telephone - but his patent was not valid in Scandinavia.

Hence, Lars Magnus Ericsson started to build telephones himself, with the help of his wife,Hilda Ericsson. In 1878, their first telephone cost 55 Swedish Crowns (around €282 today) and was made from 22 pieces, with separate receivers and microphones. In 1892, Ericsson began selling a telephone which combined the receiver and microphone in one unit. It had originally invented by two other Swedes for telephonists who needed a free hand to write while speaking on the phone.

Apart from Lars Magnus, Hilda played an important, often neglected role in the company’s development.

She worked in the workshop, built technical pieces for the telephones, dealt with clients and deliveries and managed the company when her husband traveled. As she was more educated than her husband, she was responsible for accounting since the early beginnings of the company. She was also leading the female workers in the factories, a third of the workforce in 1881.

Still, as for many women during that time, her contribution to Ericsson’s success was not celebrated during her lifetime: At the production of the 20,000th telephone, all hundred employees were photographed - except for Hilda.

The early decades of the 1900s saw an increase in activity at Ericsson, merging with several other companies and expanded all over the world, from Sweden to the US, Russia, Turkey, the Netherlands, and many more.

In the 1930s, Ericsson built anew factory environment in Stockholm’s Midsommerkransen districtthat shaped the city quarter heavily. Informally known as LM city (for Lars Magnus), it was not only a production site, but included leisure activities and associations like the Ericsson film and video club. Around 1000 apartments for workers were built in the area, by standardised means and influenced by functionalist design.

From their early developments in telecommunications, Nordic and especially Scandinavian countries have been cooperating and negotiating both formal and informal agreements.

1981 saw a common break-through: TheNordic Mobile Telephony(NMT), the first automatic, international, cellular network in the world allowing roaming in all Nordic countries. Hence, people could travel from country to country - and their phones were still connected. This technology existed nowhere else at that time, as national mobile phone systems were not internationally compatible.

NMT was the result of intensive cooperation in a working group, founded by Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden in 1969. Although subscriber numbers increased quickly, it was a niche market as phones cost 30,000 SEK (approximately 8,300 Euros) and, at more than 700 grams, were quite heavy. But NMT spread widely, across Europe and Asia and is still in use in parts of Russia today.

NMT belonged to the first generation of wireless cellular technology (1G), a system of mobile telecommunications based on analog standards. Since then, telecommunication standards have become digital, encrypted, allowing mobile Internet access - and are always developing further.

Nordic countries, especially Finland and Sweden, continue to play an important role in these developments. Especially during thedot-com bubblein the 1990s, Nokia and Ericsson played a global role in the mobile phone market.

Nevertheless, their innovations were an important factor in the development of this industry, and can be remembered today by many people - whether through their first mobile phones or by hours enjoying mobile games.

When was Piaggio founded?

What is the history of the Vespa scooter?

What is the history of the Vespa scooter?

The Vespa scooter is an icon of Italian industry and design, a symbol of the 1950s. This blog looks at the industrial heritage behind the Vespa, which was produced by Piaggio company.

Piaggio was founded in 1884 by Rinaldo Piaggio. Initially, the company focused on manufacturing railway locomotives and carriages, while duringWorld War I, the company focused on producing aircraft.

After World War II, the Piaggio factory was demolished from bombing and Italy’s aircraft industry was restricted and sanctioned by post-war agreements. Piaggio - now run by Rinaldo’s son Enrico - were faced with a need to diversify.

Italy’s war-damaged road network meant that cars would not be a viable option. Instead, they focused on producing a modern, comfortable and affordable mode of transport - the Vespa was born.

Designed by Corradino D'Ascanio, the Vespa was first presented in 1946 in Rome, though known at that time asPaperino(the Italian for duckling).

To ensure their scooter would sell, Piaggio introduced a pioneering tool: the ability for the buyer to pay in installments.

Into the 1950s, Vespa sales boomed. The scooter became associated with the cool image of Italy inthe 1950s, La Dolce Vita and Federico Fellini. Perhaps its most enduring image is Audrey Hepburn zipping around Rome on the back of a Vespa in the 1952 filmRoman Holiday.

And yet, while most associated with Italy, there is a more European dimension to the Vespa.

A large production facility for Vespa (and other scooter and motorcycle brands) was based in Madrid. This Spanish factory was established in 1952, employing more than 1000 people over its 51 years of production. It closed in 2003.

Vespa sales soared in Italy and around Europe and the rest of the world through the 1950s and 1960s. In just three years, the 500,000th and 1,000,000th Vespas were produced.

Although not as popular today, the Vespa continues to be produced by Piaggio from their factory in Pontedera, and still evokes the cool image of 1950sItaly.

How the oldest existing Dutch newspaper ended up in the National Library of Sweden

The oldest Dutch newspaper that still exists dates from 14 June 1618.

The title isCourante uyt Italien, Duytslandt, &c., which translates as 'News from Italy, Germany, etc.' Strangely enough this newspaper, together with several more of the oldest surviving Dutch newspapers, is kept in the National Library of Sweden in Stockholm.

And this is not unique. We can find other 17th century Dutch newspapers in archives and libraries in Britain, Germany, in the Baltic states, in Russia, France and Italy. Even in Turkey. Why is that?

The Dutch Republic was not the first country where newspapers were published. There are earlier examples from Germany.

In Amsterdam the conditions for the gathering and publishing of news appeared to be much better than in other places. There was a well-developed culture of printing and publishing in the city, and it had one of the most important international ports of its time.

News could easily be gathered from all directions: from the Baltic to the Mediterranean, and via the river Rhine and land roads from Germany and central Europe.

The Dutch Republic enjoyed relative freedom of the press. As long as news was not critical of the government and not blasphemy, it could be published. There were hardly any obstructions for the dissemination of international news.

As the publication of newspapers proved a commercial success in early 17th century Amsterdam, competition quickly emerged. Within a few years, different titles appeared, first in Amsterdam and shortly after in other Dutch cities.

Each tried to publish the latest and most reliable information, gathered by a network of informants both in the Republic and abroad at a time when in the surrounding countries publishers were hampered by strict political censorship.

The quality, reliability and information density of early 17th century Dutch newspapers made them not only attractive to Dutch people, but also to an international audience. For tradesmen, ship-owners, sovereigns, diplomats, intelligence services and curious civilians, Dutch newspapers contained a wealth of information on international affairs, especially concerning the devastating Thirty Years War (1618-1648).

Reading Dutch newspapers could save a ship-owner from sending his valuable ships, with even more valuable cargo, into the hands of pirate-infested seas. It could prevent a tradesman from travelling into a war zone. And it helped governments get a comprehensive picture of events as they unfolded. That is why Dutch newspapers were sent all over Europe.

But were these newspapers printed in Dutch? Yes they were!

In the early modern priod, Dutch was not very different from the dialects spoken in Northern Germany. These dialects were a kind of lingua franca, especially for the Baltic Sea trade and the Hanseatic League. This meant that most people involved in international trade and diplomacy in Northern Europe could read and understand a Dutch newspaper reasonably well.

Newspapers are meant to be read and thrown away. Within a few weeks their content is outdated, and so many newspapers were lost over the centuries.

What remains of 17th century Dutch newspapers is fragmentary. We don’t know when exactly the first Dutch newspaper was published. But it is not at all surprising that the oldest Dutch newspaper that still exists is not kept in the Netherlands. It could be in any European country. The course of history decided it is in Sweden.

Children have been a much-loved subject of pictures from the very early days of photography. We can find many adorable photos of kids posing in fancy dress or with their beaming parents in joyful family portraits in the early photographs.

Yet a substantial amount of 19th and early 20th century photography featuring children has a social documentary value rather than solely an aesthetic one.



Soon after the birth of photography (c. 1830), people realized that the power of the medium to inform and persuade could be turned to a good cause. Photographers consciously started to portray the harsh lives of children at work - a silent and often ignored group in the industrial age.

Putting their circumstances on display and raising awareness provided much-needed leverage for concrete actions toward change, especially in the hands of skilled and persistent photographers such asLewis Hine.

RELATED:Read blog:Children in the machine: Lewis Hine’s photography and child labour reform

Child labour was not uncommon in pre-industrial times, mostly helping out at the family farm or participating in handicrafts.

By the late 18th century, however, the domestic setting was replaced by an external working environment. Factories and mines in particular set their sights on children: taking advantage of their youthful energy, gaffers installed long working hours and used children for the most dangerous jobs in return for the lowest pay.

This etching of a mineshaft illustrates how their tiny postures made them more suitable for specific tasks and environments. Furthermore, they were more easy to manage and proved more difficult to organise for the emerging workers’ unions.

Children were often sole breadwinners and had no option but to earn money in whatever way possible, leaving little chance for education or many opportunities to play. Working children of the industrial age enjoyed no special status, neither in private nor in public: just another set of hands or an extra mouth to feed, they belonged to the same world as their parents, grandparents and the rest of the household, sharing the same responsibilities.

These children mostly appear in portraits as adults, featuring no discerning clothes or attributes.

In middle class families, children took up a central role as well, but in quite a different way. As the family was regarded the cornerstone of society, children gave purpose to all activities, household arrangements and social connections.

Photographs cultivating the image of the close-knit, happy family, or celebrating the romantic ideal of childhood as a time of innocence and purity, are common in this context. The obvious contrast between the middle-class notion of childhood and the living conditions of poor children, gave rise to the first campaigns for the legal protection of children from the late 18th century onwards.

Great Britain took the lead, passing a first law as early as 1802. About 30 years later, the Factory Act established a system for inspections. Throughout the 19th century, working hours were limited, while the minimum age for employment was raised. By 1901, the permissible child labour age in the UK was raised to 12 - a milestone.

RELATED:Explore thisgallery of images and photographs of child labour

At about the same time, international efforts were made to regulate child labour. Compulsory schooling was installed and, across Europe, existing legislation was effectively enforced.

More than a century onwards, however, child labour is a phenomenon still very much alive.

As recent as in 1960, a report of the United Nations showed that, especially in non-industrial jobs, young workers are still not sufficiently protected. In developing countries, moreover, children make up to 10% of the workforce in mines, factories, agriculture and services. So campaigning continues, with 2021 set as an important target date by theInternational Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour: the year in which the elimination of child labour should be a fact, and photographs such as these should relics of what we can finally call ‘history’.

The Jacob's factory in Dublin is an icon of Ireland’s industrial heritage. The blog, illustrated with newly digitised material from Dublin City Library and Archive, tells the history of the Jacob's Biscuit Factory, home of the cream cracker.

The Jacob family were Quakers from Waterford, who had been in the baking trade for some time before they started making ‘fancy’ biscuits. William and Robert Jacob obtained a new premises in 1850 and announced that they would thenceforth be adding fancy biscuits to their range of goods. Within a very short time, business was thriving.

A move to Dublin, the distribution centre of Ireland, became a necessity. By 1853, W & R Jacob's were operating out of a premises on Peter’s Row in the Liberties area of Dublin.

In 1885, the famous Cream Cracker was invented, and quickly became the company’s best seller. In fact, in 1893, six tins of Cream Crackers were ordered by Prince Frederick Leopold of Germany.

Jacob’s continued to grow, and in 1912, having run out of expansion space in Dublin, a new factory was opened inAintree, Liverpool.

Meanwhile, back in Dublin, Jacob’s was witnessing industrial unrest over wages, and by 1913, tensions were high between Jacob’s management and the Irish Transport and General Workers Union. Jacob's took a hard line with workers during the lockout that followed, and the dispute caused much bitterness and bad publicity for the firm. Rosie Hackett (after whom one of Dublin's River Liffey's bridges is named) was a worker in Jacob’s at the time, and was involved in the lockout.

The following year, World War I broke out, and many men from Jacob’s enlisted. The firm regularly sent cakes and tins of biscuits to its employees serving overseas.

The next challenge for Jacob’s arose in the form of the Easter 1916 Rising. The factory -  one of the positions seized by the rebels - was largely unscathed, and although some looting did take place in the aftermath of the rising, the government paid compensation for that.

Business continued to thrive, and when World War II broke out, Jacob’s showed great ingenuity faced with the shortage of supplies, using potatoes as a substitute for flour in some biscuits.

By the 1950s, Jacob’s was considered one of the best places to work in Dublin - the pay was good and staff were well-looked after. There was a swimming pool and recreation room for staff, a savings and pension schemes and both a doctor and dentist were hired by the company, offering free medical attention to staff. There was even anannual Christmas pensioners’ party.

The restrictions on supplies following World War II, and the emergence of Bolands biscuits in Dublin pushed Jacob’s to improve their advertising and public relations. They had many ground-breaking ideas, including associating themselves with the glamorous aviation industry, by sponsoring Radio Eireann’s programme ‘Come Fly with Me’.

1966 saw the merger between Jacob's and their chief competitor in Ireland, Bolands, and the resultant company was called Irish Biscuits. The new company continued to market biscuits under both brand names.

Two years later, the decision was made to purchase a site in Tallaght, a Dublin suburb, and to move production there. Informing this decision was the fact that many employees had been moved from tenements in the Liberties to Dublin Corporation housing schemes in areas such as Crumlin and Walkinstown. The Tallaght plant officially opened in 1975 and the inner-city Bishop Street closed its doors in 1977.

In 1991, Jacob’s was bought by Danone, and in 2004 by Fruitfield Foods. In 2009, Jacob’s ended production in Ireland after 156 years.

Jacob’s archives were acquired by Dublin City Library and Archive in 2012.  The 330 boxes contain a wide range of records representing a rich and significant contribution to the study of business and commercial life in Dublin.

This blog looks at the memories of those who worked on archaeological digs and projects in Lithuania during the Cold War, with a focus from 1948 to 1968.

The Iron Curtain was the non-physical boundary between Western and Eastern Europe after World War II. During these decades, Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union, affected by war and occupier repressions. All ways of life involved intricate situations - including archaeology.

This blog looks at the memories of those who worked on archaeological digs and projects in Lithuania during the Cold War, with a focus from 1948 to 1968.

Women and young boys were the main participants in archaeological excavations in this period.

During World War II, more than a million people died, a third of the population of Lithuania. Thus, the workforce was dramatically reduced. As a result, students near the excavation sites were the main available labour force.

During archaeological excavations, participants wore traditional clothes. Men and boys usually dressed in trousers, shirts and jackets, while women wore dresses, shirts and skirts.

Attention should be paid to the women’s clothing because, from the 1960s, during archaeological excavations, women started to wear trousers and changed their style of dressing. Nevertheless, trousers were still the exception.

A number of factors underpinned this change in women’s clothing. The Soviet Union had began new reforms, with new industries created. Work in factories changed employees' clothing. Women became part of the workforce. And a new wave of 'modern and simple' Soviet fashion began.

At the end of World War II,collectivisationstarted in Lithuania. After five years, as much as 94% of the country’s land was collectivised.

Remembering the first archaeological expeditions after the war, in 1949, archaeologistAdolfas Tautavičiuswrote: 'An expedition took place under difficult conditions. The government started to foundKolkhozcollective farms andSovkhozstate-owned farms, and began the deportation of farmers. Part of these farmsteads were empty - without windows, doors, overturned fences. Inhabitants were frightened.'

Records of archaeological excavations mention digging activities in collective farms' fields.Rimutė Rimantienėdescribed: 'We had to excavate a Stone Age settlement, but the leader of the Kolkhoz forgot and planted potatoes in this site. But everything was ok. The leader let us dig the potatoes. We dug it day after day and ate potatoes, kefir and salads, and later cucumbers and tomatoes.'

After the war, there was a lack of archaeological tools and equipment.

ArchaeologistPranas Kulikauskaswrote about what happened between 1948 -1949: 'We didn‘t have any tools or equipment. Trowel and brushes were borrowed from other museums. The Museum of Šiauliai gave us a camera. We drew the plans ourselves.'

RELATED:Explore this gallery of archaeologists at work

Food was very important during the excavation. Normally, archaeologists cooked food for themselves. Sometimes there were exceptions, either hiring a cook or eating in canteens.

In general, the particants sourced food in two ways. They bought milk products, bread and vegetables from local people. Other participants fended for themselves, by picking berries and mushrooms, and catching fish in rivers.

Archaeologist Rimutė Rimantienė remembered in a diary: 'Here in Rudnia village, life is very good. The forest is full of berries. The girls picked a lot of berries, but we could not eat them all, so, from what was left, we cooked and made jam.'

Is a paperless office possible? In this blog discover tips about workflows and processes helping to stop wasting paper while encouraging  productivity and mindfulness.

What do you say when you discover the work paper recycling box is absolutely empty? Well I would say, ‘Congratulations, everyone!’ with a big smile. Paperless office achieved.

The term 'Paperless Office' (according toWikipedia) was introduced in 1978 by Micronet, Inc., an automated office equipment company, and over the following decades has evolved into a highly visible movement with plenty of good intentions.



Just think, if each of us, in every office, in every city, took just small steps, this action could actually snowball into something greater than the sum of its parts. Imagine a workplace where none of us chooses processes that involve bleached-wood-pulp-brews; organic matter soaked in water, pressed into sheets, and cut to size. Paper comes from trees, and it is those trees that support the green lung of our blue planet.

Today, our offices probably can't go completely paperless, but hopefully these suggestions will at least help us embrace workflows and processes that stop wasting paper while at the same go some way to improve productivity and, with that, our personal state of mind.

Firstly, make it a little more difficult to print.

In time gone by, manuscripts were painstakingly copied out by hand - so only the very important documents got created. Now, we can, and often do, print everything out.

A simple change for the workplace would be to have fewer printers so that people will have to make more effort to retrieve their printouts. Human nature, being what is, won't find this as convenient as having a printer at arm's reach. Another simple solution is a double-monitor setup. By cross-referencing documents on two screens, we rely less on print-outs for comparison. A small step but one that is surprisingly effective!

Europeana Collections has centralised the holdings of thousands of libraries, archives and museums into a single, consolidated digital entity - it is, in fact, a paperless archive – pretty amazing if you ask me.

When you find something specific – an artist, composer, or an object that you would like to present to your classroom or colleagues the next day – all you need to do is to save – ideally to a cloud that supports share-ability.

A paperless environment, however, is as much a state of mind as it is a practical roadmap – a catalyst for inspiring others to be as climate-neutral as possible. Do your bit and before long, we’ll all be taking paper out of the workflow, choosing email presentations instead of printable promotions, Tik Toks instead of birthday cards, barcodes instead of tickets, and podcasts instead of pamphlets.

Industrialisation played a major role in World War One. New military machinery could be produced at a much larger scale and at a much faster rate than before. Along with innovative technology, this led to one of the most devastating wars in human history.

This concerns the production of materials for military purposes - clothing, aircraft and chemicals - as well as infrastructures – construction, railway, ports – that were laid out during the war to facilitate the war effort and to ensure the housing and mobility of the people.

Production and assembly processes became more and more automated, making mass production of ammunition and weaponry possible.

The new industrial effort also brought with it important societal changes, in particular the massive participation ofwomen, who, as men headed abroad to fight, took their place in factories, shops and offices.

Armoured cars, motorcycles with sidecars, trucks, ambulances:motorized vehicleswere commonly seen during World War One in greater numbers and growing variety.

Other means of transportation that were new to the war wereplanes, used mostly to spy on the enemies and scout out battle territory from above, but they also carried guns.

The Zeppelin, a German creation from before the war, was lighter than air, filled with hydrogen, and held together by a steel framework. The German armed forces used several Zeppelins for observation as well as flying bombs, each capable of travelling at about 85mph and carrying up to two tonnes of bombs.

The major vehicle that was to play a decisive role in the last years of the war was thetank, a British invention. At first it was mainly used to cross battle areas safely, but soon a more offensive version was developed which had a revolving turret. The French fielded their first tanks in April 1917 and ultimately produced far more tanks than all other countries combined. In 1918, the manufacturer Renault produced more than 3,600 tanks.

Mustardgas, orYperite, was first used by the Germans in 1915 in the battlefields around Ypres. The sulphur based gas caused burning in the throat and chest and eventually suffocated its victims. One problem that often arose with gas was that the wind would blow it back at the troops who used it, harming the own troops instead those of the enemy.

Flamethrowersdate back as far as the 5th century, but World War 1 brought about a portable and far more destructive version. The weapon brought extreme fear as it was something that had never been seen before. By the end of the war flamethrowers had even been added to tanks.

International world trade became more and more difficult because of global warfare and tradeembargos, making the import of necessary resource materials difficult if not impossible. A growing effort was made to become independent and replace resources for other materials. Inthis videois shown how the production of belt straps is made possible by the use of paper and iron instead of leather and rubber.

Between 1801 and 1806, French weaver Joseph-Marie Jacquard developed a machine that was then seen as one of the most important technological advancements in history: the Jacquard Loom.



Before the 1800s, weaving was a repetitive and mechanical process: lots of time and skill were required in order to produce the embellished textiles that were all the rage amongst the higher strata of society.

Joseph-Marie Jacquard was born in Lyons in 1752, from a family of weavers. At the time, weaving not only required a skilled weaver to manage the loom, but also another professional, called a drawboy, who sat next to the weaver and moved the threads according to the design of the cloth.

Familiar with the process, Jacquared understood that, in order to make the most from the business, it was key to make these movements automatic.

On inheriting the family business, he devoted his time to studying and developing a new machine that could make the weaving process faster and more profitable. Jacquard worked on his invention at the end of the 1700s, but was interrupted by the French Revolution.

After the revolution, he went back to his project and developed a machine that he presented in Paris in 1804. There, his invention was patented and was given a medal. The French government claimed that the loom was to become a public property, leaving Jacquard with no more than a small royalty.

The Jacquard loom was based on a system of cards, needles and hooks. The cards were made of cardboard, where holes could be easily punched in order to create the design; the hooks and needles used followed the holes in the cardboard, passing through these holes and inserting the thread to create the pattern. The more intricate the design was, the more cards were arranged one after the other in the loom.

RELATED:Explore this gallery related to the textile industry

Thanks to the system on which it was based, the loom could create highly complex designs and patterns, in which new colours could be used and marvellous patterns developed.

Jacquard’s invention revolutionised the textile industry, and was also fundamental for a more general technological advancement. The Jacquard loom cut back on the amount of human labour, and also allowed for patterns to be stored on these cards and then repeated over and over again to achieve the same product.

Therefore, the jacquard loom allowed patterns and motifs to be saved, on cards that could be archived and re-used, reducing time, labour and costs.

RELATED:Liberation skirts: how post-war upcycling became a symbol of female solidarity

Since the system followed a mathematical algorithm, some have argued that the jacquard loom holds many similarities with computers. In fact, both machines work by storing and organising information, creating a shared technological language that runs through the machine itself, allowing reproduction and, of course, widening the possibilities of communication.

Mining has been taking place in Bor, eastern Serbia, for centuries - intensified and industrialised since the discovery of copper ore in the early 1900s. This blog explores the 20th century industrial heritage of mining in Bor.



In eastern Serbia, where the Bor Mine is located, archaeological excavation confirms that even the Romans were involved in mining in this area. At the time, only gold was sought for.

The rapid development of the area began in the 20th century, with the purely accidental discovery of copper ore in 1902, after official exploration had been terminated.

RELATED:Explore this gallery relating to the mining industry

Many local legends surround the discovery of copper-bearing ore in Bor. One of them is about Paun Meždinović, a young man from the locality, who found the first greenish copper ore lump. During his lifetime, Paun remained known as the boy who discovered copper-bearing ore.

The area underwent intense urbanisation, transforming its previously rural environment into a highly-industrialised mining region, changing not only the natural landscape of the area but also the occupational structure of its inhabitants.

After the ore had been discovered, Đorđe Vajfert, an industrialist from Pančevo, who invested in the exploration of the area, sought the help of foreign capital in order to be able to initiate exploitation.

He managed to obtain support for this endeavour in France. After having signed a contract with the Mirabo Bank in Paris, the French Society of the Bor Mines, the Concession St. George (La Compagnie fran_ç_aise des mines de Bor, Concession St. George) was formed on 30 September 1903.

Copper exploitation progressed rapidly. As early as 1904, the mine employed around 80 miners and, during that year, 5,500 tons of copper ore were excavated, resulting in 774 tons of pure copper. In the first five years, the French company capital was increased from the initial 5.5 to 7 million French franks in gold.

For the most part, the work was manual. Copper was transferred to the nearest train station in Vražogrnci by ox-carts until 1911, when the Bor-Metovnica railway was built. The expansion of the mining-related facilities, particularly the smelter and the flotation system, brought about environmental pollution from the sulphuric fumes created in the ore-melting process. This had an indirect influence on the increase in the price of food products in the area, as well as protests from the local population involved in agriculture.

Due to the economic crises in the early 1930s, the labour cost in the Bor Mine was drastically decreased. However, by 1933, there was a recovery, initiating the mine’sgolden age,which lasted until 1940.

After the end of World War II, the period of socialism was marked with great working-class enthusiasm at the Bor Mine. As early as 1945, the Bor Mines and Smelters public company was founded by a Yugoslav Government decision.

Since the equipment was outdated and there were not enough funds for modernisation, digging was performed manually, using drills. Often, the workers used two drills, surpassing the pre-war performance first by 90%, and then by up to 160%. The number of voluntary extra hours was up to 96,000 during those years, which is unbelievable from the modern market economy perspective.

Nevertheless, this brought about the recovery of the mine and the foundation of the Bor Mining and Smelting Combine in 1961, which marked the beginning of an era in which the workers managed the mine. Innovations included technological modernisation, continuous employee training, the participation of everyone in decision-making processes and the presence of women in the work processes.

Bor continued growing along with its industry. In 1947, it was given the status of a city, with more than 12,000 inhabitants, many of whom worked at the mine. The population quickly increased, with new apartments built to house workers. By the mid-20th century, due to an intense influx of workers from all over Yugoslavia, Bor was home to people from nineteen different nations who spoke seven different languages. New schools were built and, in the spirit of self-management, courses for workers were held all the time, ensuring the continuous education of workers - exemplified by this photographs of miners in the library.

By the end of the 20th century , after decades of exploitation, the share of copper in the copper ore decreased.

During those years, the landscape of Bor and the surrounding area has been completely changed. The urban core, formed around the mining colony, grew into a proper city, whose landmarks were chimneys and horizons of mined and burnt land. This landscape serves as a warning of the high price of copper exploitation, and has resulted in the permanent environmental pollution of the area.

Who were Gebrüder Thonet?

What was the Number 14 chair?

How the Number 14 Chair became a furniture icon of Vienna's coffee culture

Vienna's cafe culture is legendary - coffee, kipferl, and kuchen are important ingredients. And another important part of the recipe are the cafes themselves and their furniture - in particular the Number 14 Thonet chair.

The firm of Thonet are synonymous with the furniture for Viennese cafes, as well as homes and establishments around the world. Their 'Number 14' chair was the world's first mass-produced furniture.

Born in Germany, Michael Thonet was a pioneer of furniture design, and the industrialisation of furniture manufacture.

Through the 1830s and 1840s, he developed new techniques which allowed wood to be bent into curves and organic shapes. This process, known as bentwood, involves wetting wood (either by soaking or by steaming) so it can be bent into shape, hardening into curved shapes and patterns.

The techniques pioneered by Thonet enabled him to design elegant and lightweight furniture. Crucially, his innovative bending of wood in this way allowed for chairs to be produced industrially for the first time.

In 1849, together with his sons, he founded a company. Gebrüder Thonet, over the years, established factories across Germany and central Europe - at their peak, the firm had upto seven factories.

Their big breakthrough came in 1859 with chair number 14 - the chair that is today an icon of design history associated with Vienna coffee houses. More than 50 million have been produced.

The chair was an international success. Its industrial production meant that it could be exported: its modular design allowed for it to be assembled and disassembled in different factories and locations.

Sales offices were established in foreign countries, with a worldwide distribution system for the marketing of Thonet furniture, as evidenced by the advertisements below. Their furniture, mass-produced at affordable prices, became a global success.

Today, Thonet develop both wooden and steel furniture - and are still producing the number 14 chair which brought the firm's early fame and fortune.

How advertising signs lit up the city

Neon lighting's distinctive glow has been brightening cities across Europe and the world all through the 20th century. Neon signs and lighting animate city centres, evoking both a modern, urban world, both futuristic and nostalgic.

Neon signs first lit up the skies in Paris in the 1910s, less than two decades on from neon's discovery. British chemists Sir William Ramsay and Morris W. Travers had first identified the gas neon in 1898, naming it for the Greek wordneos, meaning new.

Neon - dubbed 'liquid fire' - gives a distinct reddish-orange glow when used in tubes and lamps, which was soon put to use in industrial settings, particularly inadvertisingsignage and lighting.

Neon is a rare gas, but French engineer and inventor Georges Claude's companyL'Air Liquideproduced a lot of neon as a by-product of their activities. In the 1910s, Claude demonstrated the use of neon in tubes to create eye-catching advertising signs.

The neon sign as we know it was born, and was instantly successful.

Through the roaring twenties and1930s, the intense vibrancy of neon suggested progress and modernity, giving cities colourful urban landmarks.

Skilled workers known as glass benders, neon benders or tube benders can shape neon tubes into curving artistic form, such as letters or pictures.

As the signage and advertising developed, although tube lights with other colours are often called 'neon', different gases were used to create fluorescent lighting.

Neon lighting and advertising made our cities brighter, more commercial. Symbols and signs adorn buildings and walls, inspiring artists to capture their distinctive character.

Neon particularly seems to evoke the night-time and leisure economy - their use as signage or advertising for hotels, bars, nightclubs, beauty salons and more became commonplace.

Through the 1960s and 1990s, neon signs became associated with run down areas of inner cities. Their popularity waned somewhat, with today's LED signage adopted more.

Neon signs today can be considered landmarks in our urban landscapes, cherished and preserved as part of the industrial and social heritage of cities across Europe.

Marking Black History Month in Britain

Throughout the history of Britain, renowned people of the African Diaspora have left their mark, shaping the country by making it face up to its role in slavery, colonial impact, perpetual discrimination and the white washing of its history.

As October in the United Kingdom marks Black History Month, this blog looks at moments in the history of Britain’s Black communities with a focus on the development of Black History Month.

Of the many who left their mark in Britain,Ignatius Shancho(1729- 1780) was the first person of African descent to vote in Parliament elections. He was a British writer, composer and actor who helped stir the discussion on the immorality of the slave trade.

Mary Seacole (1805 – 1881), a British-Jamaican nurse famous for her work during the Crimean war, opened up an establishment called British Hotel behind the lines to nurse the wounded back to health.

ThroughoutWorld War Iand World War II, many men were recruited from the Caribbean and West Africa to help fight the wars, as well as African-American GIs during World War II.

Of those who survived, some stayed and settled, while the rest went back to their home countries.

After the war, due to workforce shortages, a large immigration campaign was set to attract people from Jamaica and Barbados to work in Britain. TheEmpire Windrushship brought one of the first large groups of these post-war immigrants to the United Kingdom. British Caribbean people who came to the United Kingdom in the period after World War II are now remembered and referred to as the Windrush generation.

The amount of Caribbean and African born people living in Britain by 1951 reached roughly 20,900.

Non-whites living in Britain faced racism, housing discrimination, race perpetuated riots, and, to this day, have a higher chance of being unemployed.

Those born in Britain faced an identity crisis trying to reconcile Britain's past with its present, all the while still facing similar treatment as the generation before them.

In the 1980s, Ghanaian-born Akyaaba Addai Sebo, a special projects officer of the Ethnic Minorities Unit at the Greater London Council, and chairman of the African Refugees Housing Action Group, was stirred by the identity crisis that Black children faced.

He decided to start the UK version of Black History Month in 1987 upon hearing a colleague open up about her child who had asked why he couldn’t be white, and after observing and talking to children who didn’t identify with Africa.

Ina 2017 interview, he mentions that he was'awakened to the fact that even some Ghanaians tried to mimic being Afro-Caribbeans and some Afro-Caribbeans would take offense being referred to as “African”'.

His team became fixed on challenging the Eurocentric version of history that was being taught in the school system by conceiving an annual celebration of the contributions of Africa and people of the African Diaspora to world civilization throughout history.

The month of October was chosen because it was the start of a new academic year, and they believed that children were more likely to‘absorb more if their living environment buzzed with positive vibes, instructions and images about themselves and their origins, thus celebrating who they are as “Africans”'.

Some criticise Black History Month as only teaching Black history in the space of one month, and allowing it to be ignored for the rest of the year.

However the importance of Black History Month paves the way for recognition that Black history is European history, American history and African history.

[Black History Month] is to inculcate self-pride and especially in children. Self-pride is the catalyst for achievement and there is no greater “truth” than knowing yourself.

Akyaaba Addai Sebo, 2017

Roure-Bertrand Fils and the perfume industry in Grasse

When we spray on perfume, how often do we think about how the fragrance was made?

The process to extract fragrances and oils from flowers is a perfect blend of nature, science and industry, as illustrated beautifully by this short book about Roure-Bertrand Fils factory in Grasse, France.



Perfume and scents have been worn by people for centuries, becoming an industry in the 18th and 19th centuries.

Grasse - a world capital of perfume - was home to the perfumerie of Roure-Bertrand Fils whose origins date back to 1820.

Roure-Bertrand provided aromatic plants and essential oils to create fragrances for other brands, who mix, blend, bottle and sell the perfume.

The firm's technical and scientific innovation in extracting oils and essences helped establish them as a leader in modern perfumery. In 1900, Roure Bertrand Fils was presented with a grand prize at the Universal Exposition in Paris.

This book - part of the digitised collections of the the Bibliotheque national de France - dates from then, and contains 30 photographs illustrating the process from flower field to bottled perfume.

This selection shows highlights of the process - you can alsobrowse the full book here.

Author Miloš Crnjanski’s works form an invaluable part of Serbian 20th-century literature. His creative writing - poetry and prose - as well as his life in general, were marked by key elements: migration, exile and existential drama.



Crnjanski was born in Csongrád (a town in Hungary he referred to as ‘Siberia for clerks’), where his family lived quite humbly. Later, he moved to Timisoara where he graduated from primary and secondary school, played football and wrote his first verses.

In 1912, he relocated to Belgrade and then to Rijeka and Vienna, where he began his philosophy studies (1913-1914).

He was in Vienna at the onset ofWorld War I, so he was forced to be a soldier for the Austro-Hungarian army. He had to participate in battles taking place in Galicia and Italy, constantly facing the atrocities of war.

At the end of the war, Crnjanski returned to Belgrade where he enrolled in literary studies and began editing theDanperiodical.

His first books portrayed the futility of war suffering and the tragic division of the young generation. A warrior’s return to his homeland is the central motif of his poetry collectionLirika Itake(The Lyricism of Ithaca), published in 1919.

Crnjanski laid the foundations of the early avant-garde movement in Serbian literature. That can be illustrated with a sentence in hisObjašnjenje Sumatre(The Explanation of Sumatra) from 1920: ‘The world still hasn’t heard the terrible storm above our heads, while shakings come from beneath, not from political relations, not from literary dogmas, but from life. Those are the dead reaching out! They should be avenged.’

War motifs and indignation due to war carnage also shaped the tone of his poetic novelДневник о Чарнојевићу(A Diary of Čarnojević) from 1921, which re-shaped the traditions and fixed patterns that dominated Serbian novels of the time.

RELATED:The Trailblazer: Jelena Dimitrijević, Serbia’s first feminist author

After briefly travelling around Europe, he returned to Belgrade, where he married Vida Ružić, his life-long companion.

After graduating from the Faculty of Philosophy in 1922, he started teaching at the Fourth Belgrade Grammar School. Simultaneously, he published opinionated articles in distinguished periodicals, such asPolitika, Vreme, etc. Representing radical Modernism, his articles published in the weekly periodicalIdejecaused fierce literary and political debates at the time.

Crnjanski’s professional journey further led him into the diplomatic service for the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. He worked in Germany (1935-1938) and Italy (1939-1941). When Yugoslavia took part in World War II, he was evacuated from Rome to Lisbon, across Madrid, and later he got to London.

Crnjanski had a harsh life in London, as he had lost all his sources of income.

Even though he had a university degree and spoke five languages (Hungarian, German, French, Italian and English), he spent some time working in a bookstore, delivering Christmas cards and as a bookkeeper in a shoe store.

By the 1950s, he became a London-based correspondent ofEl economist,an Argentinian periodical published in Buenos Aires. He wrote prolifically. At the time, he wroteRoman o Londonu(A Novel on London), a powerful cosmopolitan work on exile taking place in London, with a Russian protagonist.

RELATED:Read and browse a version of Crnjanski'sRoman o Londonumanuscript

He also wrote a masterpieceDruga knjiga Seoba(The Second Book on Migration) and a poetic OdysseyLament nad Beogradom(Lament over Belgrade).

RELATED:Read Lament over Belgrade

As a political emigrant, Crnjanski spent time completely away from the Serbian literary scene. In the 1950s, he published some of his writing in periodicals of emigrants in America, Canada and Germany.

However, when he returned to Serbia in 1965, some of his books had already been published there, includingSeobe (Migration), Dnevnik o Čarnojeviću(A Diary of Čarnojević),Konak(Lodging),Itaka i komentari(Ithaca and Comments),Druga knjiga seoba(The Second Book on Migration).

Therefore, to Crnjanski, life in emigration represented a drama on cultural marginalisation, which had a powerful impact on his creative work.

The feeling of being a foreigner affected his inner self, with the central figure in his works being a man in a foreign place. He portrayed emigrants, outsiders, people living on the margins and borders of society. With the power of extraordinary literary language, Crnjanski managed to show that a man at the edge of existence could still possess a shine of true greatness.

At the same time, Crnjanski’s genius is reflected in the fact that his works enable us to truly feel the spirit of the epoch we still live in (for instance, neoliberalism inRoman o Londonu).

Crnjanski was able to live his elderly days peacefully in his homeland.

Soon after he returned from his 20-year-long exile, hisSabrana dela u 10 tomova(“Collected works in 10 volumes”) were published in 1966. In 1971, he received the respected NIN award for Best Novel of the Year and the Most Read Book of the Year award forRoman o Londonu.

In 1977, he died at the age of 84, with his widow gifting his complete legacy to the National Library of Serbia. In 1993, the Miloš Crnjanski Foundation published a critical edition of his works.

Origins of Fàbrica Gròber

The rise of Fàbrica Gròber

War, destruction, and redevelopment

Photographing the factory

Closure and legacy

Fàbrica Gròber, a textile factory which specialised in trimmings, buttons and haberdashery, is a landmark of Girona history, even today 40 years after it closed.

This blog looks at the rich history of the factory which offered jobs and economic prosperity and modernised culture and society in its region.

The Franciscan friars ofGironawere forced to leave their monastery in 1835. They could never have imagined that its grounds would become an industrial site.

After the demolition of the monastery and the re-development of the site by a group of entrepreneurs, Cristòfol Gròber - a businessman with Italian roots - laid the factory’s foundations.

Gròber’s choice of Girona was well-considered.

The nearby Monar reservoir guaranteed a steady water supply, Girona offered a large potential workforce and several other Italian families ran successful businesses in the city. After buying buildings in Girona to house his factory, Gròber also purchased land in the neighboring townBescanófor a new hall and hydroelectric plant.

After the turn of the20th century, Gròber acquired more property in Girona, and established an extensive industrial site in the city centre.

World War Idid not stop the rise of the Fàbrica Gròber. International demand for its products was high and competition was low, resulting in growth and prosperity.

By that stage, unions had been founded to improve working conditions. The Gròber workforce was required to work ten-hour days with no social support. However, medical care was made accessible through the ‘Germandat de Socors Mutus, Sant Cristòfol’ scheme created by the company, and a dedicated cooperative made affordable consumer products available.

Remarkably, in the early 1900s and throughout its 90 years, Fàbrica Gròber predominantly employed women, who comprised up to 93% of its workforce.

RELATED:‘A woman’s work is never done’: women’s working history in Europe

Cristòfol Gròber retired in 1919 and the factory became a company, with the Portabella brothers as main shareholders. They led the business into the 1920s, a prosperous period for Fàbrica Gròber.

The 1930s was a time of crisis which intensified during theSpanish Civil War, and ended with a devastating fire that destroyed much of the factory’s produce, warehouses and machines.

This disaster threatened job losses for over 1,000 workers at Fàbrica Gròber, and for many more people employed by companies depending upon the factory’s orders. A quick recovery was vital.

New infrastructure, inaugurated in 1940, modernised the factory’s workflow and improved its integration in the city. Part of the factory leading onto the central city streets was dedicated to administration and personnel services.

In 1944, the factory’s infrastructure expanded to include a daycare centre for the children of its 1,700 workers.

Many of the photographs of the factory in this blog - now part of the collections ofAjuntament de Girona / Centre de Recerca i Difusió de la Imatge (CRDI)- are by Josep Thomas Bigas, an architectural photographer from Barcelona.

The images are also aesthetically striking, reflecting vital aspects of Girona’s social and industrial history. Their architectural compositions, ingenious camera positions, well-balanced scenes, geometric qualities and intriguing patterns appeal to the eye and provide a fitting visual counterpart to the company’s history.

In the following decades, Fàbrica Gròber kept up with industry advancements in machinery, workflow, infrastructure and technology. In 1970, a massive boiler explosion killed four people, and marked the beginning of the end for the factory.

A few years later, its operations moved to Bescanó. Subsequently Fàbrica Gròber’s buildings were demolished and the Mercadal-district was redeveloped.

Today, the factory’s legacy lives on in the 'Carrer' named after its founder, with many people in Girona holding vivid memories of the factory’s era, its mighty halls and role in Girona’s industrial heritage.

What did the people in the lower orders of society and children read in the 18th and 19th centuries? In the Netherlands, their main reading material was catchpenny prints.

What did the people in the lower orders of society and children read in the 18th and 19th centuries? In the Netherlands, their main reading material was catchpenny prints.



They were cheap, mass-produced sheets printed on one side on unfolded sheets of paper. Because they were sold for one or more cents, they were known as catchpenny prints or ‘centsprenten’ in Dutch. The prints of about 30 x 40 cm size contained one or more images and a short accompanying text, often written in rhyme and secondary to the images. Retailers or merchants sold the prints per piece and teachers sometimes gave a print as a reward to students.

Catchpenny prints cover all kinds of subjects. There are prints with images of ships, soldiers, animals, tools, people in other countries, but also board games and narrative prints with fairy tales, murder stories, farces, stories from Dutch history, Bible stories and more. A popular theme on catchpenny prints are children’s games: next to marbles and riding in a goat cart, also less charming games such as knocking off a goose's head and shooting birds are depicted.

Another popular subject was the history of Jan de Wasser. Jan and his wife Griet 'swapped pants for apron cloth', after which Jan did women’s work such as cooking and cleaning. Together they sailed to an island with a baby tree to ‘have’ a baby and after this ‘childbirth’ Jan had to stay in bed instead of his wife. Jan de Wasser was the typical example of a henpecked husband.

At the end of the eighteenth century, the ‘Maatschappij tot Nut van 't Algemeen’ (Society for Public Welfare) began to encourage publishers to produce prints with more educational value. The images became neater and the language of the prints was cleaned. It was the intention or the hope that both children and parents would become more aware of important civil norms and values.

The quality of the paper was poor and so was the quality of the images, but that kept the price low. In order to save costs, prints were often sold uncolored or with a coarse stain. More expensive prints in colour were produced using templates. Low prices made catchpenny prints very popular and they were spread widely.

Catchpenny prints provide an excellent insight into the subjects that the Dutch population was interested in, which makes them a veritable treasure trove for everyone who is interested in the history of the Netherlands. The prints can serve as a source for a wide range of research on text and language, on the daily life of our ancestors, on disappeared crafts and professions, on pedagogical views and role patterns. Illustration techniques and dissemination can also be studied using the prints.

Millions of catchpenny prints have been printed and distributed in the Netherlands and Flanders by dozens of printers, publishers and resellers. More than 100.000 prints came off the press every year and most of them have been passed on to others, got lost, left in the pub or ended up as packaging material. Fortunately, the National Library of the Netherlands holds a large collection of four thousand catchpenny prints from 1730-1935; it is largely built up by donations. The largest part of the collection was donated by private collectors Aernout and Leny Borms-Koop. 1,255 of their prints arenow available onlineat Europeana for everybody to research and enjoy.

What is the history of the Maggi brand?

How was Maggi sold worldwide?

What is the history of Maggi seasoning, and where does it come from?

As a child growing up in Senegal, Maggi cubes and Maggi sauce were a big and important ingredient in many Senegalese dishes, if not all of them.

I remember watching countless advertisements on TV promoting Maggi cubes, with a Senegalese lady in her boubou (traditional clothing) preparing a meal.

So imagine my surprise when, 16 years later, living inthe Netherlands, I stumbled across Maggi cubes in supermarkets.

Was it possible that Africa had somehow brought Maggi to Europe? I was even more confused when I sat in a Polish restaurant waiting to try some delicious pierogi and saw the infamous bottle of Maggi sauce laid on my table.

The Maggi brand originated in Switzerland in the 1880s, created by entrepreneurJulius Maggiwhen he took over his father’s mill (who himself was an Italian immigrant).

He wanted to improve the nutritional consumption of working families, creating plant-based ready made meals and instant soups rich in protein. In doing so, he became a pioneer of industrial food production.

Not long after, he went on to create his popular dark seasoning sauce from hydrolysed vegetable protein, making foods taste meaty for the working classes who couldn’t afford it.

By 1908, he had created meat substitute bouillon cubes.

The product became popular across Asian and African countries through colonisation and immigration, as well as trade deals.

By the 1970s, and at this point already owned by Nestlé since the late 1940s, Maggi introduced its new product line of instant noodles to Malaysia, which then gained massive popularity in India as well.

To this day, Maggi cubes and Maggi sauce are an important ingredient in the staple foods of many countries including Ghana, Senegal, Germany, Poland, Romania, Thailand, China and across Latin America. Maggi instant noodles are popular in other countries like India, Bangladesh, New Zealand, Malaysia, Australia and Pakistan.

The brand adapts its product to suit local tastes and, due to its advertisements suggesting it is locally produced in each individual country, Maggi has been able to invoke a feeling of ownership, home and nostalgia across cultures.

How the industrial revolution changed writing culture

Documents written centuries ago are fascinating, revealing not only the thoughts of those who wrote them but a history of how they were written. This blog looks at the changes in the way we have expressed our thoughts through the written word since the industrial revolution.



Theindustrial revolutionbrought about a shift from an economy based on agriculture and handicrafts to one focused around large industries and factory systems. Alongside this, increased need for written documentation developed. During this period, new technologies and materials changed writing practices, in private as well as in the workplace.

For centuries, feathers had been the most popular writing tool. However, writing with feathers was not easy.

Turning a feather into a working quill required other tools, such as a small knife to cut the feather and produce its narrow end. Writers need to sharpen the point and remove the hollow shaft inside. This required care, as feathers tend to break easily. Additionally, writers needed sand and ink, and an inkstand to store them in. Why sand? To blot the page after writing.

RELATED:Read our blog:Reading habits in the past

Until the 19th century, the quill was the most common writing instrument. It was replaced by factory-manufactured dip pens with steel nibs. Pens were less fragile than quills, and retained their sharp edges for longer. Extra equipment was still required: a holder for nibs of different shapes or sizes, pots of ink and sand.

Mass-produced steel nibbed pens were affordable for large parts of European society, making writing accessible to many people for the first time. Birmingham was a centre for pen production, producing more than half of the world’s steel nibs.



Fountain pen, Faber with box and manual, 1890s, Sörmlands museum, CC BY-SA(A. W. Faber was the name of today’s Faber-Castell until 1900 - they still manufacture pens).

From the 1880s onwards, fountain pens became a worldwide success.

Ink was not free-flowing in steel-nibbed pens, posing a problem for manufacturers. Fountain pens, on the other hand, had an inner reservoir of ink, removing the messy process of unscrewing the inkstand and dipping the nib into ink. Nevertheless, they still required an ink pot to fill up the inner reservoir.

Despite advancements in pen design, factories and companies’ need for faster and more efficient communication grew during the 19th century.

The advert above reads ‘Empty your inkpots, break your pens, and write with Remington’, reflecting one of the first and major shifts from handwriting to typing.  The invention of the typewriter revolutionised the speed at which information could be put on paper. In 1853 the record for writing with a pen was set at 30 words per minute; at the same time, stenographers and telegraphs could already achieve 130 words per minute.

The typewriter solved time-efficacy problems in businesses worldwide, bringing a new writing culture that no longer needed handwriting.

Typing machines developed throughout the 19th century. The first commercially successful typewriter was the“Sholes and Glidden Type-Writer”.E. Remington and Sonsacquired the patent for this typewriter in 1873. Their “Remington No. 2” had the first QWERTY keyboard for the Latin alphabet and, due its international success, it remains widely used.

For decades, typewriting has been the most common method of written communication in business. Even today, people worldwide experience the typewriter’s heritage in their physical or digital keyboards, laptops and smartphones.

Although the machines that we type our thoughts into have become digital, the heritage of the way we write in our offices, schools and everyday lives was shaped by inventions long ago.

Risen from the ashes

ForLibraries Week,  we are putting the spotlight on the history of a remarkable university library. Leuven University's library has had a past as rich as it has been turbulent, peppered with religious conflicts, political discord, and wartime catastrophe.



The first university founded in Leuven is now known as the Old University of Leuven. The first rector, Willem Neve, travelled to Rome to ask the pope for his blessing in the founding of a new university. Pope Martinus V decreed the founding of Leuven's university on the 9th of December 1425, making it the first university in the Low Countries.

Leuven's university had to wait until the 17th century for a university library to be founded. Before that, students and professors had to rely on private collections to research and discuss.

In 1636, the Cloth Hall - the building which had been home to the cloth weavers' guild - was given to the university to be used as a university library.

Leuven's university was founded as a deeply Catholic university and mainly stayed that way throughout the next centuries.

During the 16th century, Protestant books were burned and an index was created at the library that listed forbidden books of Lutheran writings. The Louvain Index was the inspiration for the famous Index Librorum Prohibitorum later created by the Pope which contained a long list of forbidden books.

During the French Revolution, all universities were abolished so new Écoles Centrales could be founded.

The Leuven university disbanded in 1797. The rich collection of its library was partly transported to Brussels' École Centrale and to the Bibliothèque Nationale de France in Paris. Ironically, the abolishment of the Old University of Louvain meant that most of its precious historical library was saved from future devastation.

The first half of the 19th century was a turbulent one for Leuven's University.  In 1817 the Rijksuniversiteit Leuven was founded, a non-denominational state-driven university. Belgium gained its independence from the Netherlands in 1830 and founded a new Catholic University in Mechelen in 1834.

A year later it moved back to where the original Catholic University had resided for centuries, Leuven. Its library in the Cloth Hall was reinstated.

Catastrophe struck again in the 20th century. In 1914, at the start of World War I, the university library in the Cloth Hall was burned to the ground by German forces.

About 300 thousand invaluable books were lost in the fire. Luckily the most valuable had been transported to Brussels and Paris more than a century earlier, saving a wealth of heritage and information from the flames.

The burning of the library was widely used in anti-German propaganda to show the barbary and ruthlessness of the German soldiers.

This outrage sparked a movement that helped reinstate the library in a new building after the war, aided largely by the 'Belgian Relief Fund' founded by Herbert Hoover. With this money, a new monumental library was built and finished in 1928.

Learn how two Dutch brothers who wanted to make a lightbulb factory started the multinational concern.

Looking around your living room, kitchen or bathroom, it may surprise you how much has been thoroughly influenced by the innovation of a single company - Philips.

An immense variety of products has been produced by this entity: coffee makers, electric razors, X-Ray machines, cassette tapes, colour televisions…



But it all started in a small Dutch town in 1891, with a lightbulb moment.

Learn below how two brothers who wanted to make a lightbulb factory started the multinational concern that we now know as Philips.

On the back of the picture an anecdote is written that says that Anton Philips, Gerard's brother, was never really interested in Gerard's experiments, and on more than one occasion had tried to knock over Gerard's experimental setups by throwing rotten apples through the window!

His interest in Gerard's exploits increased later when he became the main salesman of the Philips' company lamps.

Philips' lamps became very successful very quickly, which allowed the company to grow and expand at a fast rate. Between its founding and World War II, Philips started creating new types of lamps, built new factories to produce new materials and products, and expanded into new markets.

In 1939 Philips started selling the first electric shaver with rotary blades, which would later become the Philishave and revolutionize the shaving and grooming market.

This rapid expansion led to a huge growth in the economy of places where Philips put their factories and warehouses and created jobs for swathes of employees.

Philips profited duringWorld War Iby gaining market share in the countries that boycotted the import of technological products from Germany, like the UK, France and Russia. In 1923, Svenska AB Philips was founded, a Swedish factory branch manufacturing radios.

During World War II, a significant amount of machinery in the Philips factories was seized by the Germans and transported to Germany. After the end of the war, these machines were sent back to Philips.

The post-war era became a period of explosive expansion for Philips, in which they started producing radios and television sets, among other things.

This rapid expansion led to more factories abroad, and the start of encouraging migrant workers to come to the Netherlands to work for Philips. A large amount of migrant workers, predominantly from Spain, moved to the Netherlands to come work for the company.

Philips had a good reputation: they provided schooling and housing for workers, built libraries and provided grocery stores for Philips employees. These grocery stores, Etos, still existing today in the Netherlands.

The history of Philips started small, grew quickly, and continues until this day.

Other things Philips invented or is famous for? Senseo coffee machines, the first casette tapes, X-ray machines, the VCR, the TV test pattern, and even video calling! Watch an explanation on one of the first videophones below.

Bolckow Vaughan and the growth of Middlesbrough

Industrial heritage can be ephemeral - the buildings where we work can disappear and are not always seen as important reminders of the past. This is certainly the case with the ironworks and steelworks of Bolckow & Vaughan, which drove the growth of Middlesbrough.



At the start of the 19th century,Middlesbrough, in the north east of England, was a village of less than 50 people. During the latter half of the 19th century, however, it grew rapidly to a large town.

The iron and steel industry dominated the area since iron production started there during the 1840s. One of the instigators of this growth was the industrial partnership of Henry Bolckow and John Vaughan.

RELATED:Explore this gallery of industrial architecture across Europe

Henry Bolckow - who was born in Germany, and moved to Newcastle upon Tyne in 1827 - provided business expertise and investment, while John Vaughan contributed technical knowledge. Their partnership expanded from their early operations into coal mines, limestone quarries, brickworks, gasworks and a machine works. In 1864, a company,Bolckow, Vaughan & Co., was formed.

Their long-lasting and successful partnership transformed Middlesbrough to 'Ironopolis', the centre of ironmaking in Britain. By 1868, four million tons of iron per year were produced there, with Bolckow Vaughan considered to be the world's largest pig-iron producers.

Such was the importance of the ironworks that Henry Bolckow became Middlesbrough's first mayor in 1853 and, later, its first Member of Parliament in 1867. John Vaughan became the town's second mayor in 1855.

Bolckow, who was born in Germany, was featured in this report in the Berliner Börsenzeitung newspaper in 1879.



Extract from report on page 4 of Berliner Börsenzeitung, 4 December 1879, Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin - Preußischer Kulturbesitz, Public Domain (read full report at this link)

Bolckow paid for a landscaped free public park for Middelsbourgh, with Albert Park opening in 1868. He also built Marton Hall in Stewart Park which later too became a public park.

Sadly, Marton Hall burned down in the 1960s and, with Bolckow Vaughan in decline since the late 1800s and having been taken over by another company in 1929, now not much remains of the ironworks. But their legacy lives on inAlbert Park, the 'People's Park' of Middlesbrough.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines celebrates its 100th anniversary on 7 October. To honour this jubilees, this blog explores the cultural heritage of KLM found on Europeana. Come fly with us to discover stories and pictures from aviation history.



KLM stands for ‘Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij’, literally translated as ‘Royal Aviation Company’. Despite having merged with Air France in 2004, KLM is still seen as a truly Dutch icon.

Planes have, of course, changed quite a lot in the past 100 years. KLM has transported passengers in several types of aeroplane, including those made by fellow Dutch company,Fokker.

While the makes and models of the aircraft change, one thing that persists is the desire to get a few more Dutch guilders or Euros out of the passengers by encouraging them to buy food, drinks and merchandise - such as dolls wearing one the many uniforms KLM staff have worn over the years.

Particularly famous are a collection of small ceramic houses. Containing small bottles ofgenever, these have been given as gifts to business class passengers and have become collectors items.

In 1934, a KLM aircraft 'Uiver' (meaning stork) and its crew took part in theMacRobertson Trophy Air Race(also known as the London to Melbourne Air Race). They came second overall, flying the route in 90 hours. The Dutch were very impressed by this success, producing souvenirs like this commemorative coin, plate and badge.

Oblivious to the merchandise is a very special type of passenger -animals. KLM even maintain an ‘animal hotel’. This footage from 1952 shows how a young elephant was escorted by a ‘KLM-trained’ chicken, who was tasked with stopping the elephant feeling lonely during the flight.

That operation looks to have gone smoothly, but it hasn’t always been plain sailing for KLM staff. In 1952, 600 KLM pilots went on strike for four days because of a row with KLM management.

Reforms and changes

Changing practices

Two families transformed

20th century transformations

How industrial agriculture transformed rural life

Agriculture lies at the heart of social developments all over the world. Farming has transformed the lives of farmers, and also people and nature worldwide.

Focusing on Scandinavia as an example, this blog explores the drastic changes in people’s everyday working lives related to the agrarian revolution in the 19th and 20th century.

Pre-industrial agriculture looked quite different to today’s farming.

In 1870, two thirds of Swedes were working in agriculture and living in rural areas. Subsistence and small-scale farming, together with part-time work in fishing and forestry, were the most common practices. This satisfied families’ basic needs, ideally giving them goods to barter or trade locally for everything else they needed.

Everyday life depended heavily on seasons. Droughts or long winters could diminish a harvest or result in not having enough food for both animals and people.

From the 18th century onwards, land reforms (skiftetin Swedish) were one of the first major changes in Scandinavia.

InScania(a region in southern Sweden) people lived together in villages. Every family owned different patches of land distributed over the area. Based on a principle of fairness, everyone owned both more and less fertile land.

But with growing populations, this system was less and less able to provide enough food. Overuse of the land was a consequence. Thus, politicians and landowners decided to distribute farmland differently.

Farming families now lived on and owned connected pieces of land, transforming former village structures. These reforms led to an increase in productivity, and consequently in wealth and population growth. New crops and plants such as the potato, imported from America, also had an impact.

In Norway, another system was common in the 19th century:tenant farming, where tenants rented buildings and soils from the farmer.

Bad harvests in the 1830s forced people to leave their farmsteads or emigrate. Especially for single young women, moving to cities also meant the dream of escaping the harsh conditions of agriculture. This lead to half of all Swedish women employed in agriculture leaving the sector between 1890 and 1940.

RELATED:'A woman's work is never done': women's working history in Europe

Through the 19th and half of the 20th century, farm work was mostly manual labour, with animals playing an important role.

Horsesfor example were needed to cultivate fields or pull wood in forests. They also were essential for local trade and transportation. Agricultural practices also shaped domesticated animals - horses such as the NorwegianDølahestwere especially bred for heavy farmwork.

Some of the fastest changes in agriculture took place in Scandinavia in the 20th century, with three factors playing a significant role in this development.

Political programs were set up to support people in owning their own small farms, reacting to the large emigration waves that harmed the countries’ workforce.

Innovations made these small farms profitable: at the turn of the century, artificial fertilisers and pesticides were invented that allowed for cultivation on formerly poor soils. Mechanisation with steam engines and tractors started to transform work.

Stories from two families, preserved by Maihaugen and Skansen, show how life on these small farms were transformed.

In the early 20th century, manual labour was a common feature of the Swedish Åkesson family’s life.

Bengta and Per lived with their two sons atSkånegården, a farmstead built during the 18th and 19th century. The Åkessons did not pursue subsistence farming - they delivered the primary products for a growing urban population.

Through innovations in breeding and cultivation, they made good profits by growing sugar beet and keeping some pigs and cows. This coincided with a growing demand for sugar, wheat, milk and butter.

Although Bengta still had to harvest the heavy sugar beet by hand with a knife like the one above, they were able to use machines such as early reapers or seed drills. Those were still drawn by horses - tractors were not common in Scandinavia until the 1950s.

After World War I, the Åkessons had to sell the farm. Within ten years, it had become too small to earn a living.  Innovations in machinery and growing dependencies on selling goods at market prices affected their ability to make a living from the farm.

Afterwards, their land was united with the neighbours’ farm, a sign of the more rationalised and mechanised agriculture.

The Morken family in Norway offers another typical 20th century story for _småbruk (_small-scale farming in Norwegian and Swedish).

After World War I, they benefited from new settlements intended to limit Norwegian emigration. With state funding and an interest-free bank loan, Karen and Anton builta simple farmhouse and a barn, based on standardised architectural plans.

At first, they only used the kitchen and a small ground-floor room, where the couple slept together with their son. Instead of using the second floor themselves, they rented it out as a leisure home. It was not until World War II that their farmstead got connected to electricity; running water and a sink were installed in 1948.

The Morkens had several animals on their farm - a horse, ten cows and three calves, five sheep and a pig.

As their small farm did not make enough profit to earn the family’s living, Anton additionally drove local children to school. Other men worked in the forest industry or road-building. Women usually baked or sewed for others and picked berries for an additional income.

In the second half of the 20th century, agriculture went on to change profoundly.

Tractors became common tools on every farm in Scandinavia. Mechanisation, automation, fertilisers and pesticides enabled intensive farming in Scandinavia, as well as many regions across the world.

The amount of farms decreased, while the farms grew larger. Rationalised planting, growing and harvesting led to fewer farmers managing much more land. Machines could now fulfill the tasks that many seasonal workers and family members used to do.

With less people needed in forestry and on farms, villages that formerly flourished became deserted as urban industries became the major way to earn a living in 1950s and 1960s Europe.

With the aim to maximize profits, European agriculture has profoundly changed in few centuries to feed more and more people with growing demands - often at the cost of environment and biodiversity.

Eight firms that were 100 years old in 2019

1919 was an industrious year, with many organisations we know today being founded.

In the wake ofWorld War Iand theTreaty of Versailles, many entrepreneurs and companies were able to take advantage of the advances in technology during the war years, as well as, in advance of the 1920s, a modern, forward-thinking climate to increase trade and cooperation.

From aviation to fashion, food and drink to vacuum cleaners, here are eight well-known European firms celebrating their cententary in 2019.

RELATED:Beautiful & useful: Bauhaus and Walter Gropius - 100 years of Bauhaus

Iconic British motor firm Bentley was founded in 1919 by Walter Owen Bentley, who had designed and supplied engines for the war effort. Following the war, his contribution was recognised with an MBE and £8,000 from the Commission of Awards to Inventors.

This gave him the capital to establish a premises inCricklewood, North Londonwhere he turned his engines business into one for car production.

The company grew through the following decade, in particular associated with motor racing with five victories at Le Mans in the 1920s. Now, 100 years later, Bentley Motors are located in Crewe, one of Europe's leading luxury car manufacturers.

The company we know today as British Airways has its origins 100 years ago, at the beginning of civil aviation.

In August 1919, Aircraft Transport and Travel Limited, a forerunner company of today’s British Airways, launched the world’s first daily international scheduled air service, betweenLondonandParis. On board: one passenger, a consignment of leather, several brace of grouse and some jars of Devonshire cream.

Many mergers and name changes later, today British Airways celebrates its 100 years as one of the world's largest airlines and a century of heritage to look back upon.

French car manufacturerCitroënwas founded in 1919 by the industrialistAndré-Gustave Citroën.

1n 1908, Citroen became the chairman of automobile manufacturer Mors. During World War I, he was responsible for mass production of armaments. After the war, realising he would have a modern factory without a product, Citroen returned to cars.

Launched in 1919, theCitroen Type Awas the firm's first model. From there, Citroën became the first mass production manufacturer in Europe and, by the 1930s, the fourth largest automobile manufacturer in the world.

Danone- a multinational food corporation now based in France - has its roots in 1919.

Isaac Carasso, a Sephardic Jewish doctor, who was born in Thessaloniki, moved to Barcelona in 1916.

There, concerned for stomach ailments of the city’s children, including his own son Daniel, he began producing yoghurt, selling it in pharmacies. Carasso named theyoghurts Danone, after his son.

A decade later, in 1929, Daniel Carasso joined the family business, moving the company from Spain to France, and later, during World War II, to New York where the brand name was changed to Dannon to sound more American.

Now Danone - again based in Paris - sells products in more than 120 countries.

Swedish home appliance companyElectroluxwas founded in 1919.

Its founderAxel Wenner-Grenhad launched his first vacuum cleaner, the Lux I, seven years earlier in Stockholm.

In 1919, his firm was acquired by Svenska Elektron A, changing the naame from Elektromekaniska AB to Elektrolux. In the early years, it sold Lux vacuum cleaners in several European countries.

During the 1930s and 1940s, the firm drewinspiration for its products from the car industry, with modern, fashionable, streamlined products.

Today, Electrolux produces and sells many types of household appliance in more than 150 countries worldwide.

Dutch airlineKLMwas founded in 1919, when a consortium of eight businessmen founded the firm on 7 October, one of the world's first commercial airline companies. Two weeks later, the firm's first office opened on Heerengracht in The Hague.

The first KLM flight took place on 17 May 1920 flying from London's Croydon Airport to Amsterdam Schiphol.

100 years later, today KLM flies to 145 destinations around the world.

British supermarket retailers Tesco were founded in 1919 by Jack Cohen as a group of market stalls, although not initially called Tesco.

That name appeared 5 years later when Cohen bought a shipment of tea from Thomas Edward Stockwell and sold it under the name combining these initials with the first letters of his surname. It was still later, in 1931, when the first Tesco store opened in Burnt Oak, a suburb of London.

Sweden'sWasabrödis the world's largest producer of Scandinavian style crisp bread -knäckebrödin Swedish.

Its name, Wasa is associated with Swedish kingGustav Vasaand was chosen to create an easily recognisable brand.

Its first bakery was opened inSkellefteåin 1919 by Karl Edvard Lundström. In 1931, the company opened another bakery - completely mechanised - inFilipstadwhich still operates today (along with another factory in Celle, Germany).

Today, wasabröd products are sold in 40 different countries.

Pioneering photographer Lewis Hine's images of industry and labour led to reform and changing laws.

Born in 1874, Lewis Hine was initially a teacher and sociologist. In the early 1900s, Hine led his sociology classes to Ellis Island, photographing some of the thousands of immigrants arriving there.

Through these photographs, Hine began to realise that documentary photography could be a tool for social change and reform.

In 1907, Hine was the staff photographer of the Russell Sage Foundation for whom he photographed people and life in steel-making districts of Pittsburgh.

One year later, he became the photographer for the National Child Labor Committee, leaving his teaching position.

Over the next decade, Hine photographed industrial conditions, revealing the extent to which children worked in the mills, mines, canneries and factories of theUnited States. Children from poor and migrant families, as young as five years old, were working long hours in dangerous and dirty conditions.

In many cases, photography was forbidden in mines and factories. These were scenes that weren’t meant to be seen - revealing these conditions was met with considerable opposition.

Hine adopted many personas - fire inspector, postcard vendor, bible salesman - so he could be allowed in, and travelled hundreds and thousands of miles taking almost 5,000 photographs.

These photographs supported the Committee's lobbying to end child labour, and inspired a wave of moral outrage. By 1912, a Children's Bureau in the Department of Labor and Department of Commerce had been created, following NCLC's lobbying.

Finally, in 1938, the Fair Labor Standards Act was passed bringing child labour to an ultimate end.

Lewis Hine's photographs were instrumental in changing child labour laws in the United States. His photographs - whether of children working, migrants at Ellis Island or wider industrial conditions - emphasise the human side of modern industry and remain powerful today.

How did the industrial revolution change women's working lives?

How did women's working lives change after World War II?

Long before the home office was invented, working at home was already commonplace for one group within society: women.

Even today, unpaid and care tasks at home are still often perceived as women's work - or not appreciated for the hard work it is. In order to discover the reasons behind today's inequalities in the workplaces of men and women, this blog takes a closer look at women's work history in Europe.

When we look back at the history of work, there is often a bias towards work performed by men.

Women have been historically depicted as housewives, engaging in crafts or occupied as mothers. Although this might have been accurate for parts of European societies in the past, it only accounts for wealthy elites. Until industrialisation, the majority of Europe's population worked in agriculture, and women were just as involved in working on farms as men.

The industrial revolution changed women's working lives greatly.

Working in shifts for a salary and in locations such as a factory, office or shop became part of modern life. Young, unmarried or working-class women especially moved to cities to work in the growing industries. Education played a major role for women entering the workforce, with an increasing percentage of girls attending school during the20th century.

As they earned less than men and were not unionised, employers often considered women to be attractive workers. At the same time, women worked in their homes, for example in piecework, where they were only paid for each completed piece, or in assembling pieces such as copper coils.

Thus, women carried a double burden: they had to take care of children, elder family members, and the household - work that was not paid and hidden in private spaces. And they contributed to the family’s income with their paid work.

As these jobs were often located at home, part-time, casual or even illegal, records on female work are not as reliable and well-documented as men’s labour.

Until industrial, urban work became normal, men had not been idealised as the sole providers for the family. As more women entered the workforce, women became idealised as a counterpart to men. The married woman, taking care of her family and the household, not engaging in paid work, became the social ideal - although most female biographies were different.

As legislation developed to regulate women and children’s working hours and ban them from especially dangerous tasks, the role of men as sole wage earners was gradually reinforced during the 19th century.

These ideals were considered normal by the turn of the 20th century: women were perceived as the opposite sex, weaker and of finer nature than men, with natural abilities in care work. As mothers and wives, the private home sphere became their domain; the public sphere belonged to men.

In contrast to these ideals, women were needed in the workforce, especially in times of war. Still, these cannot be seen as emancipatory.

Jobs in temporary factories for weapons or other materials needed in the battlefields meant working in dangerous circumstances, for low wages and in many nations, women’s service to their nations was rapidly neglected after bothWorld War Iand World War II - and they were driven out of their employment after the men came back.

After World War II, the situation for women in Western and Eastern Europe was quite different.

Some nations, such asGermany, experienced a wave of conservatism, where women were expected to fulfill roles as housewives and mothers. At the same time, there was also a progressive movement with women entering the workforce with more and more equal rights, for example in Scandinavia. In the new political systems in Eastern Europe, women were formally equal to men and expected to work in paid employment.

In all cases, the home was still often perceived as the domain of women and all household tasks from child-rearing to cleaning and cooking as women’s work. They continued to carry the double burden - with paid and unpaid, visible and invisible work.

Resulting from the difficult heritage of work circumstances for women, even today, there are still striking inequalities for women at the workplace.

In 2018, women in the European Union earned an average 16% less than men. Nevertheless, if including unpaid work, they work six hours longer than men. More than half of women have experienced workplace harassment or sexual violence. 73% of Europeans say that women spend more time on household and caring tasks than men. Women are promoted less, in part because they tend to take more career breaks to care for children or family members.

Because of this life-long gender discrimination, women face a higher risk of poverty in old age, receiving pensions that are a third smaller than men.

So although a lot has changed for women at work, there's still a lot to be done in order to achieve equality, at work, at home and beyond.

Log driving in Sweden and Finland

In the 19th century, the forest industry in northern Europe started to grow steadily. Log driving - a cheap and fast way to transport logs - was critical in meeting the growing demand throughout Europe for sawn wood and square-cut timber.



BothSwedenandFinlandhave dense networks of streams and creeks of different sizes. At the time, these were a more efficient solution for transporting logs than railways or roads. Log floating or driving in Sweden (timmerflottningin Swedish) had already begun in the 16th century, and in Finland in the 17th century (tukinuittoin Finnish).

In Finland, long rivers such asOulujoki,IijokiandKemijokiwere used for log driving. The total length of timber-floating routes in Finland was 40,000km, of which 20,000 km were riverpaths. Sweden’s popular waterways included rivers such asKlarälven,Dalälvenand Vindelälven.

The climate in both countries was perfect for log floating. The trees were cut during winter, with spring floods helping the log floating process.

Small streams near the forest were usually the starting point of log driving.

When logs floated apart, log drivers would direct and control them in curves of the stream with pike poles. Reaching the broader streams and rivers, the logs would be bundled together in timber rafts controlled from the banks of the river or from boats. On lakes, the timber rafts were pulled with tugboats.

Log driving was such a crucial part of the industry that both Sweden and Finland had special laws, allowing the use of streams for log driving. The Even today the Finnish water act states that ‘unless otherwise provided by law, everyone has the right, without inflicting unnecessary damage, harm or disturbance, to... float timber in the water body…’

In the 20th century, log drivers were romanticised figures. Their work was dangerous, even deadly sometimes, and they were seen as masculine, free souls, who were easy-going and popular among women.

In both Finland and Sweden, log driving inspired art, literature, drama and music.

Harry Brandelius’ song 'Flottarkärlek' - a well-known tune in 1950s Sweden - tells the story of a young log driver. In Finland,Teuvo Pakkala’s play 'Tukkijoella' started the so-called 'log driver romantics' phase in 1899, which resulted in several movies and books about log drivers’ lives.

During the Second World War, labour shortages affected the log driving industry, as men were recruited to armies. At that time, women, young boys and older men worked as log drivers instead. Before the war, around 45,000 people were involved in log driving, but in the war period this number decreased to 30,000−35,000.

After the 1950s, the industry started to fade, as the forest roads and logging trucks improved.

Increasing demand for electricity was also a reason for the decline of the log floating industry, as it was not compatible with the need for hydro-electric power. Special legal privileges for log driving were removed in Sweden in 1983. The last float in southern Sweden was in the 1960s, with the floating era in the rest of the country ending completely with the last log drive in the Klarälven river in 1991.

Today, you can still find some timber rafts floated in Finland, but these days logs are usually transported using railways or logging trucks.

Even though log driving itself is not common anymore, people still value the skills and the tradition of log driving.

Finland’s annualTukkilaiskisat(log driver competitions) are still organized today. In the competition, skills such as rowing, boat pulling, log running, running over a log jam, log paddling and cross-country running are tested.

Mathematician, engineer and inventor Joseph Maximilian Petzval is best known for his contribution to modern photography.

He was born in 1807 in Spišská Belá, now inSlovakia, but at that time part of the Kingdom of Hungary.

The large universities of the Habsburg kingdom offered great opportunities to students and therefore many people, like Petzval, migrated to study Following his early education, Petzval moved to Budapest to study engineering at the Institutum Geometricum, where he also studied mathematics later.

By 1837, Petzval had moved once more – to the University of Vienna, where he was appointed a professor of mathematics, teaching mechanics, ballistics, optics and acoustics as well.

It was there, in 1840, that he developed the lens that carries his name. The Petzval lens revolutionized early modern photography.

This invention had a substantial impact on the history of photography. Petzval used mathematical models for the design of his lens, reducing the exposure time by one-sixteenth.

Previous daguerreotypes required a long exposure time – between 15 and 30 minutes approximately – which was too long to result in good quality portraits.

The Petzval lens was known for delivering extreme sharpness in the centre, strong colour saturation, and a blurred effect in the out-of-focus area. Because of these characteristics, Petzval lenses were perfectly fit to produce portraits, especially when the photographer wanted the subject to be the centre of attention.

Yet Petzval’s groundbreaking work would end in disappointment for him.

Petzval collaborated with the Austrian entrepreneur and opticianPeter Wilhelm Friedrich von Voigtländer, who had the right to produce Petzval's lenses. However, by 1845, the collaboration was mired in disputes, as Voigtländer moved lens production out of Austria taking advantage of Petzval's patent limitations.

Voigtländer produced and sold thousands of lens over the next decades, becoming known throughout Europe, as well as producing the world's first all-metal daguerreotype camera.

Petzval also collaborated with the Austrian optics producer Dietzler, who later went bankrupt in 1862.

In 1859, the final straw for Petzval came: his home was robbed, and his drawings and manuscripts were destroyed. He gave up his research in optometrics, never having fully published his findings.

Yet his legacy does live on: Petzval’s achievements are used today in cinematography, astronomy and meteorology, and have - among others - allowed for photographing stars and galaxies.

Metropolitan London

Other cities follow suit

How to construct an underground metro system

Metros: here to stay?

How underground railways developed in major European cities in the 19th century

In the first half of the 19th century, European cities were expand rapidly, bring larger populationd and many urban problems, like traffic congestion.
The development of underground mass transit eased some of these pressures of rapid population growth.

London was the first city to construct an underground railway beneath its bustling streets.

By 1850, the city already had seven train stations and it was estimated that around 200,000 people entered the City of London every day. The concept of an underground railway linking the City with mainline train stations has already been proposed in the 1830s, and a new proposal on these lines was finally accepted in 1852.

The Metropolitan Railway started operating inLondonin January 1863 as a goods and passenger service. Its wooden carriages were gas-lit and hauled by steam locomotives. From 1905 onward, the tracks were gradually electrified.

Other European cities felt similar growing pains as London during the late 19th century.

The Budapest opened its electrified metro system in 1896.Glasgowfinished its first lines later that same year, followed by Chicago the year after. The Paris metro opened in 1900 after enormous efforts.

Many more systems followed - includingBerlinand Madrid. Today there are 212 metro or rapid transit systems operating around the world.

The construction of underground metro systems often raises concerns about undermining building foundations and the risk of subsidence caused by digging and vibrations. These concerns were not unfounded because many early lines were built using a technique known as"cut-and-cover". This involved relatively shallow tunnels for which a trench is excavated and roofed over with an overhead support system.

The advantage was that the smoke from the steam engines could easily escape to the nearby surface. The downside to this way of building were the enormous excavation pits at the surface level, for which everything on top had to be demolished, although they usually followed the street plan.

Deeper tunnelling, sometimes into the bedrock, became possible with the introduction of pneumatic drills and tunnel boring machines from the 19th century onwards.

In this way, some metro tunnels and stations were constructed at a staggering depth. It goes without saying that constructing metro systems was – and is – a strenuous job for workers.

Later in the 19th century, when electrified locomotives became available and networks expanded, metro tunnels could be built deeper underground, but could also continue above the surface and connect to regular trains.

Train carriages became more comfortable over time too, although overcrowding has remained a challenge.

There are no signs of metros becoming obsolete anytime soon.

Today, the London Underground serves over 1.3 billion passengers annually and 4.8 million daily – and it’s only the world’s 11th busiest metro system.

Although the construction of underground railways is costly, time-consuming and inconvenient, they are an effective alternative to the air pollution, urban congestion and civic blight brought by motorised vehicles on city streets.

Sharing your story

Europe at Work, Europeana’s new season, brings stories of our personal working lives together with archive material on industrial and labour-related heritage.

The working world we inhabit today is rich and varied, and tells the story of technological and societal changes over time. Starting today, Europeana’s new season, ‘Europe at Work’, brings stories of our personal working lives together with archive material on industrial and labour-related heritage.

Explore the newindustrial heritage collection on Europeana- bringing together around half a million cultural heritage objects from around Europe - to discover and uncover fascinating industrial and labour-related heritage material. Over the next months, we'll be adding galleries and blogs exploring these themes.

Work isn’t just what we do. It’s often who we are and where we’ve come from. It’s an integral part of our cultural heritage.

Working lives change over time, often driven by changes in technology. Books were once written out painstakingly by hand, then came the concept of printing, and the printing press and mass production, then came digital word processing and e-readers.

RELATED:Explore this gallery of working lives across Europe

The land was once worked by hand and beast, then came steam engines, tractors, GM crops, automated dairy parlours and intensive factory farming. Trades and skills develop at each turn and with them, people’s daily lives, family routines and attitudes.

Whatever you do, your work doesn’t stay within the office, the shop floor, the classroom, the construction site. Whenever we work, labour or volunteer, we’re part of a bigger picture. Your working life shapes your habits, your routines, your identity and your community. What happens in society and technology both shapes and is shaped by how and where we work.

And we want to record this - share your working life stories, past or present, with Europe at Work and see how you fit in to this rich and diverse working world.



You can join in bysharing a story about your working life, wherever you worked, either online now or at one of a number of collection day events across Europe in autumn 2019.

Think you have nothing interesting to share? Think again! Europe at Work is about all of us. Look at theseexample stories- from amodern dairy farmerto ashopkeeper in the 1890s.

From September to December 2019, Europeana along with museums, galleries, libraries and archives across Europe, will run a series of collection days which will record the stories of the people who have worked at industrial heritage sites across Europe.

The firstevent is in Luxembourg on 28-29 September 2019. It focuses on the Portuguese community of Luxembourg and will be held at Gare-Usines de Dudelange, Luxembourg.

A Dutch Poet Laureate writes in an album amicorum

How would you like having a poem composed especially for your friendship album? This is what happened to Elizabeth Adriana Staats (1823-1896).



It is 1841 andHendrik Tollens(1780-1856) is a celebrated poet in the Netherlands. One of his poems has been chosen to be the national anthem and his poetry collections are purchased by many. So what does a poem of the Poet Laureate do in thealbum amicorumof the 18-year-old Elizabeth Adriana Staats from Rotterdam?

The poem, entitled ‘In the Album of a Girl', is written on a folded sheet that is kept in the album between two pages. The poem is not signed or dated by Hendrik Tollens but a short note at the bottom of the page gives us clarity about its origin:

'The above-mentioned verse written by hand, by the Dutch poet Tollens, and handed to the Pharmacist J. Bulterman, at his request, to be placed in the album of his girlfriend, this being a favour in return, for a white-lead analysis in 1841. J. Bulterman'

The pharmacist Jesaia Bulterman (1810-1866) was Elizabeth's fiancé. Jesaia tells us that the poem is a return service for an analysis of the pigment white-lead, a very popular pigment among artists. But why does the famous poet Tollens need a white-lead analysis? That is because Tollens was not only a poet but also an entrepreneur in the paint trade. He was the owner of the paint and varnish factory Verf- en Vernis fabrieken Tollens & Co in Rotterdam. That Tollens went to Jesaia Bulterman for an analysis of white-lead is not so peculiar: it was common for pharmacists in the 19th century to have a side-business in paints.

It is possible that Tollens was a regular customer of Bulterman’s pharmacy, or that during one sole visit Jesaia convinced Tollens to write a poem for hisgirlfriend’s album amicorum.

In an album amicorum, a booklet in which the owner collects contributions such as poems and illustrations from family, friends and acquaintances, you can find many kinds of texts. In the 16th century, for example, it was common among students to write scholarly quotations in Latin in these friendship albums. In the 19th century, Dutch alba amicorum were filled with quotes from poems by the popular poets of that time: Willem Bilderdijk, Rhijnvis Feith, Hieronymus van Alphen and Hendrik Tollens.

Poetry was very popular in the 19th century. It was the period of Romanticism and nationalism. After the French occupation of 1810-1813 the regent Willem I was crowned King of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands and there was a need for peace in the new nation. Poetry about God, the fatherland and family values were popular among the population. It also helped book sales that poets were idolized as celebrities.

19th-century alba amicorum of young, unmarried women are filled with poems with titles such as: ‘Hommage and Virtue’, ‘Hymn to Heaven’ and ‘My Homeland’.

These poems were usually written down by family or friends, but a poem personally written by a celebrated contemporary poet in an album amicorum is unique! Especially one written by the Poet Laureate Hendrik Tollens in the album of Elizabeth Adriana Staats from Rotterdam.

Hendrik Tollens writes in this poem: ‘But if my prayers are heard, then the sun is shining for you […] roses without thorns bloom on your path.’ Unfortunately Tollens’ wish for Elizabeth did not come true. The life of Elizabeth and Jesaia was covered with thorny roses: they lost two of their children, a girl of 7 and a boy of 16, in quick succession.

The poor person’s reading material

Books were expensive in Scotland between the 17th and 19th centuries. But literacy was comparatively high, and people were keen on reading. There was a large market for cheap, easy-to-get reading material: so-calledstreet literaturebecause it was simply sold on the streets.



A popular type of street literature waschapbooks: small booklets of 8, 16 or 24 (and sometimes more) pages, poorly printed on thin paper, covered with a paper wrapper and often adorned by crude woodcuts. They sold for a penny apiece.

Chapbooks contained songs, tales, children’s stories, history and news and formed the staple reading diet of the lower classes. Chapbooks were sold by street criers, hawkers and itinerant pedlars, orchapmen. People also bought them at fairs, from the printers’ shops, in pubs and even toy shops.

For a penny, people could read the last words of an executed criminal, an account of a recent disaster, a garland of songs, or the history of famous heroes like William Wallace, Rob Roy, Nelson or Napoleon.

Chapbooks were rarely read in silence. More often than not,they were read or sung aloudto an audience, which often included those who were illiterate.

The earliest Scottish chapbook was printed in Edinburgh in 1682. It is a verse edition of the popular folk tale of Tom Thumb, the little hero from the time of King Arthur. The 18th century saw a large increase in the publication of chapbooks. Tom Thumb reappears alongside religious exhortation and humour:

Thewoodcutsused for illustrations were often generic and only loosely related to the topic of the chapbook, and sometimes not at all.

For instance, the following account of natural disasters like avalanches and sandstorms includes a woodcut of a kilted Scotsman in front of a horse and cart with no snow or sand in sight:

A story about the adventures of four Russian sailors has a fitting woodcut of a sailing ship:

Particularly interesting are several editions of ‘Factor’s garland’, a story about the adventures of a young man who rescues a damsel in distress, is thrown overboard a ship, rescued, and finally marries the princess. The first three woodcuts below appear in chapbooks that were produced by the same printer: John Morren (Edinburgh).



Factor's garland

Chapbooks in Scotland were not only published in English.Lowland Scots, the vernacular language of the common people, appeared mainly in the form of proverbs or songs. There are also a very small number ofchapbooks in Gaelic, all of them containing popular songs:



Songs by Wm. MacKenzie



Love Song



Lament for the Earl of Argyll

In the 19th century, chapbooks slowly made way for newspapers, penny dreadfuls and periodicals. These were produced to a higher standard and appealed to the more discerning readers, also of the lower classes.

Stories and symbols of Europe at the end of the 20th century

Krzysztof Kieślowski's Three Colours film trilogy was made a few years after the fall of the Iron Curtain.1989was the beginning of a new era in which people, ideas, and stories, began to move freely in spaces previously separated from each other.

These last three films directed by Kieślowski, with scripts written jointly with Krzysztof Piesiewicz, do not have overtly political themes. Yet, when watched today, they can be interpreted as stories about Europe changing at the end of the 20th century, transforming into a continent of new possibilities, returning to universal concepts that became important in a new way.

All three films were the result of new international co-productions that were possible for the first time in the history of post-war cinematography, signs of the new opportunities opening up for European cinema.

Krzysztof Kieślowski, a director from Poland, made these three movies together with film crews from various European countries. The three movies takes place in different countries: France, Poland and Switzerland.

Migrating artists, as we could call members of these film crews, together created movies that achieved international success, adding a new dimension to the slogans of liberty, equality, and fraternity. These slogans of the French Revolution could be seen to symbolise a kind of artistic revolution.

The films develop these slogans as personal and univeral themes, rather than solely historical. Freedom inThree Colours: Bluedoes not refer to Central and Eastern Europeans’ fight for liberty from communist dictators. The red in Three Colours: Red has nothing to do with the colour of the revolutionary flag. Instead, these personal stories can be seen as symbols of Europe at the end of a turbulent century.

InThree Colours: Blue, Julie, the film's protagonist, is a young widow, whose husband - a famous composer - and daughter died in a car accident. In the face of tragedy, she chooses a kind of freedom, cutting herself off from the world, breaking ties with her friends and acquaintances. However, she returns from this exile of cold liberty, accepting the fact that to live completely means to love and be loved - and that means a sacrifice of some freedom on the personal level.

Over the film's final scene_,_ we hear Song For The Unification Of Europe, accompanied by verses in Greek from Saint Paul’sHymn to Love. The opening and readiness for a new love, which the film tells about, also symbolises the openness of Western Europe to enter into a new and close relationship with countries from its eastern part, recovered after years of separation, ready to sing together the song of the uniting continent.

Three Colours: Whitetakes place in France and in Poland. WhileThree Colours: Bluerefers to the theme of unifying Europe,Three Colours: White's story of the turbulent marriage of a Polish man, Karol, and a French woman, Dominique, seems to be the opposite. Kieślowski’s film is about inequalities that stand in the way of people who love themselves, but are shaped by different social, moral and cultural experiences.

Divorced, Karol returns to Poland of the mid-1990s: a country of new economic opportunities, quick fortunes and great social contrasts. He wants to regain his lost fortune and position, a revenge to his wife who renounced him. The former hairdresser turns into a businessman, trying to take advantage of newly acquired property to trick Dominique into coming to Poland. He wants not only to conquer her heart again but make her experience the suffering of imprisonment. That is his way of making his beloved Dominique more ‘equal’ to him and aware of what it is like to be a person from Central and Eastern Europe, where happiness often must be paid for by suffering.

Three Colours: Red,set in Geneva, is about the close encounter of Valentine, a young student, and Joseph Kern, a retired judge, who is bitter and harsh, having discovering his beloved was unfaithful. Meeting Valentine, a good, gentle and honest woman, is a chance for him to recover from his miserable despair. Their story is mirrored in that of Auguste, a young lawyer, who, like the judge, is beset by broken-hearted disappointment.

The film ends with a memorable scene showing passengers saved from a sinking ferry after a storm on the English Channel. The heroes of all three films are among those saved: Julie and Olivier fromBlue, Karol and Dominique fromWhite, Valentine and Auguste fromRed.

The symbolism of these saved characters is as if we were watching the peoples of Europe fished out of the turbulent waves in the sea of h​istory, saved and ready to enjoy the rescue together on the continent of unifying countries.

Kieślowski asks us to question liberty, equliaty, fraternity: do we Europeans still remain faithful to their basic values? Is love, as Kieślowski showed in his last films, still what blue, white and red together mean?

A story of migration

Each of the films ofKrzysztof Kieślowski’s Three Colours trilogy explores a topic from the French Revolution motto Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité.

Three Colours: Whiteaddresses equality through the fate of Karol Karol (Zbigniew Zamachowski), the movie’s main character, a Polish man living in France. The film plays with the notion of emigration and return, and questions how equal we are occupying those positions.

In the film’s opening scenes, Karol is seen in divorce hearings asking the judge: "where is equality here?!” As his marriage ends, he is left only with an old suitcase and his hairdressing diplomas. This small, inconspicuous man in a raincoat is lost in the enormous interiors of the Paris Palace of Justice.

The film symbolically shows Karol’s descent through his journey downwards into the underground Paris metro station, where he earns some extra money playing a comb. He sits on a concrete floor, literally and metaphorically lower than all the people passing by.

There, he meets another Polish man, Mikołaj, and together they hatch a plan for Karol to return to  Poland hidden in an old suitcase.

Back in Warsaw, Karol transforms himself from a hairdresser into a businessman and capitalist. He orders a construction crew to completely rebuild a wall around his property.

He undergoes a drastic metamorphosis only after returning. His dirty, old coat turns into an elegant, expensive suit. In France, with no money, a French bank clerk cuts his card when he wants to withdraw money. But, in Poland, Karol enters a bank with a bag filled with dollars. In Paris, Karol is not shown at work, whereas, in Warsaw, after his return, he is a sought-after master hairdresser who woman queue for.

Later, Karol rents an office in a modern tower block on a very high floor. Karol and Mikolaj stand together at a window and comment, “Nice... Warsaw under us”. His fortunes have swung a long way from begging on the Paris metro. Some time ago he did had almost nothing, now he has almost everything.

The film questions, however, how far one can come. After saying “Warsaw under us” Mikołaj quietly hums the melody of a Polish song, which Karol then plays on the comb, repeating what he did when they met for the first time in the metro. Even though now they are businessmen, how much of the confused emigrants is still inside?

The film plays with the contrasting meanings between France and Poland, up and down, bad and good.Kieślowskiwrote in his autobiographyon Kieślowski: “At the beginning, Karol is humiliated, tramped into the ground… Everything he ever had is taken away from him and his love is rejected. He wants to show that he is not just as low as he’s fallen, he’s not just on a level with everybody else, but that he’s higher, that he’s better… Therefore he becomes more equal.”

Hop's horticultural heritage

With today's craft beer movement, the origins of beer culture come more and more to the fore.



As interest in traditional recipes and forgotten brewing practices rises, ingredients such as hops gain new attention. Hops are one of Europe’s traditional crops, and are responsible for a beer’s distinctive bitterness and aroma.

Beer was one of the most common medieval beverages: it had far less alcohol than today’s beers, was used for meals such asbeer soupand became known as liquid bread, consumed by both adults and children.

Before the Middle Ages, beer was mostly brewed with grains. But, because of hops' antibacterial effects, beer brewed with hops kept longer and protected against infection better.



Ethnological research in Värmland, Älvdals, Värnäs; Hop garden, 1928, Gösta Berg. Stiftelsen Nordiska museet. CC BY.

TheHallertau regionin Germany was the first known place where hops were cultivated in the 8th century. During the High and Late Middle Ages, growing and processing hops spread across the continent, first in Central and Western Europe, later also in countries such as Denmark, Sweden and Norway.

Hops' flowers’ use in brewing beer was the reason for its worldwide cultivation in hop gardens from the 11th century on. Hops can grow up to 30cm a day. Farmers planted seeds in rows, winding the shoots around long wooden bars anchored deep in the soil. (Today, these have been replaced by long strings and wires.) Hops reach seven to nine metres, grown vertically so it gets sunlight.

For centuries, hops needed to be picked by hand. The harvest in late August and September was especially labour-intensive. Men removed the long bars from the soil, cut off the tendrils and carried them to farmsteads, where other family members and older people sorted the flowers from the leaves.

For the harvest season, people often migrated to hop-growing regions. For example in England, whole families from London or industrial cities such as Birmingham went to rural areas, living there for some weeks.

Until the 20th century, it was common that children worked in the hops harvest - both in the fields in harvesting and in picking the flowers.



Hopmarket in Asse, 1925, Jacques Hersleven. Koninklijk Instituut voor het Kunstpatrimonium. CC BY-NC-SA

The flowers were laid out to dry and ranked every day in hop houses. After the hops were put in large bags of up to 50 kilograms, agencies collected them from locals growers and sold them at hop markets. These were important trading places for brewers as the variety and quality was crucial for their product’s success. Many former hop markets are today important heritage sites, such as theHop Exchangein London.

Hops were harvested in this way until the agrarian revolution. In 1909, a mechanical hops separator machine was invented.

After World War II, growing hops whether privately or commercially, diminished due to competing markets in the US. Hop growing has always been risky: the plants need a lot of care, and quality and quantity varies a lot due to climate.

Although many European countries such as Germany and the Czech Republic still are among the largest hop producers worldwide, growing hop is now mostly limited to certain regions, with varieties fit for commercial growing and controlled bylarge brewery corporations.

Still, the craft beer movement and smaller breweries cater for a demand for diverse beer tastes and mix up the market. Hops are now chosen not just for their yield, but for taste. Since 2012, the number of varieties in use has grown from 180 to 250. Small breweries in many European countries now focus on craft instead of quantity.

In this way, hop growing, an original European tradition, has gone from local to global and back.

He devoted his life to music

Composer Adrian Willaert was born around 1490 in the Low Countries, and moved at a young age to Paris to study law at the Sorbonne. There, having met composer Jean Mouton, he decided to devote his life to music.



Between 1515 and 1520, Willaert was employed as a singer in Ferrara. In 1519 he was active in Rome and from 1522 to 1527 worked at a court chapel again in Ferrara.

One of Willaert's most enigmatic and legendary works dates from this early period: the riddle duoQuid non ebrietas.

The work is full of music theoretical and philosophical experiments and - according to legend - is supposed to have been so complex that even the singers of the papal chapel did not manage to perform it correctly. During this period too, Willaerts’ first motets and chansons were noted in prestigious manuscripts (such as the Medici codex) and appeared in printed collections.

In 1527, Willaert was appointed chaplain of San Marco Basilica in Venice, a position he held for 35 years, until his death in 1562. He was responsible for the direction of all music performances and the music education of the singers.

When Willaert began at the basilica, a relatively large vocal ensemble with international singers was already in place. Although he did not implement radical changes immediately, Willaert improved the quality of the chapel in such a short time that it was soon able to compete with the best in Europe.

A wide range of activities and contexts explains the versatility of Willaert’s oeuvre: as a maestro di cappella he was responsible for composing music suitable for liturgical use at the San Marco, while in madrigals, villanelle and instrumental works, he let his creativity run free.

In no time, a group of pupils formed around Willaert.

They, in turn, would become the first generation of what is known as 'the Venetian School'. These include Gioseffe Guami, Giovanni Croce, organ composers Jacob Buus, Dionisio Memmo, Girolamo Parabosco, Annibale Padovano and Vincenzo Bellavere, as well as concert masters Girolamo dalla casa and Giovanni Bassano, and music theorist Gioseffo Zarlino. The latter reflected Willaert's philosophy and composition practice in his treatises, and contributed significantly to the dissemination of his aesthetics over the next 50 years.

With Willaert and the Venetian School, Venice took over the torch from Florence as the center of madrigal art. Moreover, theVenetians- in contrast to theRoman school, that culminated in the 'classical' polyphonic counterpoint - represented a more innovative, progressive musical language.

This is how Willaert, the great man from little Flanders, paved the way to the ‘seconda pratica’: the dawn of the baroque.

The 18th century playLa DalmatinabyCarlo Goldoni- sometimes referred to as 'the Italian Molière' - is a striking illustration of the relationship between Venice, Istria and Dalmatia.



Since the late middle ages, the relationship between Venice, Istria and Dalmatia has been complex.

In addition to quarreling for political, economic and religious reasons, and despite the dominant hierarchical position of Venice, there was also a mutual dependency: alliances with Venice offered eastern Adriatic cities trade opportunities and protection, while on the other hand the coastal region was indispensable for the Venetians to maintain their trade monopoly.

This spectrum often created internal tensions: in some cities, for instance, discord arose within the population that partly sympathized with the Venetians, partly with the Croats of the hinterland.

The tragicomic play conquered the Venetian stage in 1758, leaving the audience so pleased with Goldoni that he notes in his memoirs 'they showered me with praise and gifts'.

The play would become one of the best known ofGoldoni’s texts, and was particularly successful because of the sentiments of patriotism expressed in it.

InLa Dalmatina, Dalmatia and Slavic characters were seen as semi-oriental elements which, combined with the Moroccan setting, placed the play in the vein of the exoticism that was fashionable at the time.



Comedia intitulada A dalmatina, Carlo Goldoni, Public Domain, Biblioteca Nacional de Portugal

In his memoirs, Goldoni confirms the Venetians' particular attitude toward the Dalmatians by stating that they in fact felt great appreciation for their 'counterparts': they acted as 'antemural Christianitatis', helped to protect the Italian properties and secure their princes.

In the foreword to an edition ofLa Dalmatina, Goldoni stated: 'The [piece] is about a loyal nation worthy of La Serenissima.'

Although some nuance is necessary, the influence of this political-economic situation on the cultural history of both Italy and Croatia can’t be overstated: Istria and Dalmatia have - perhaps more than any other regions - absorbed the influences of Renaissance and humanistic Italy.

Many artists from the Adriatic East Coast enjoyed their training in Venice, or were active there for at least part of their career. In turn, they have considerably enriched the artistic landscape of Venice.

Goldoni himself would not remain in Venice all of his life.

He migrated to France, directing the Comédie-Italienne in Paris for several years. From 1764 onward, this great innovator of commedia dell’arte and opera buffa retired to become a teacher to the princesses of Versailles. Yet he died in poverty after having been deprived of his royal pension, just one day before a restitution would be granted.

Goldoni left behind a noteworthy and much-cited autobiography, titledMémoires. Today he is remembered not only through his creations, but also with several landmarks in his native city: a statue sculpted by Antonio Dal Zotto, the Ponte Goldoni bridge and the magnificent Teatro Goldoni - the oldest, still existing theatre in the city.

Newspapers in World War I

DuringWorld War One,newspaperswere the main source of information.

With no radio or television or internet, there were other ways to get the latest news like word to mouth, the weekly newsreels in the cinema or the ongoing exchange of letters between soldiers at the front and their loved ones at home.



However, word of mouth could likely be considered inaccurate and mail could be slow and interrupted.

In general, newspapers were the most frequent and more reliable source for news, and, with multiple editions per day, certainly the most up to date.

However, at the front, most soldiers distrusted civilian newspapers because of the optimistic almost propaganda-like patriotism that so often “flavoured” the news. Instead, in many places along the front soldiers started their own newspapers.

More entertaining than informing these papers offered an outlet to the soldiers for their emotions as well as their artistic talents. Topics covered everything from picking fun at their jobs in the trenches and the absurdity of their day to day life in between days of fighting to humor and women.

Even after the war, newspapers found a way to play a part in looking back at the war. Many clippings ended up in the scrapbooks of soldiers and nurses, along with other war time pictures.

This newspaper clipping from the "Oldenburger Sonntagsblatt", published on July 29, 1916, was kept by Lorenz Rasmussen from Sønderborg, Denmark. Rasmussen was affiliated to the German army with the Oldenburgische Infanterie Regiment Nr. 91. The piece mentions the death of his Bataillonsfürer Martin von Raumer who fell on July 2, 1916 at Zatuvie in Wolhynien. The event in which Rasmussen took part is fully discussed and kept as a memoir.

Newspapers also played a vital role in allowing people to commemorate the loss of their loved ones. The official obituaries were often kept as a memorial along with the portrait of the deceased person.

Newspapers during World War I reported the conflict from many perspectives, and offer a multifaceted approach to World War I for those who read them.

Vintage newspaper mastheads from across Europe

Mastheads are one of the most striking features of newspapers. Often the first thing we see, they are designed to catch our attention and communicate the newspaper’s identity and attract readers.



Within the thousands of digitised historic newspaper titles inEuropeana Newspapers, there’s a lot of variety in their mastheads - from simple text to more elaborate fonts, from what seem like hand-drawn sketches to ornate engravings. There’s a lot to explore.



Težak, 10 March 1869, University of Belgrade, Public Domain

The designs are visual representations of local and national identity, some with political purpose, others following contemporary art and design trends.

What we think of today as newspapers have been published in various formats since the 1600s. Mastheads have been an important part of newspaper front pages since the 17th century. Calledcorantos, the first newspapers in Amsterdam developed a newspaper format from Germany, removing an illustrated front page, replacing that with a title on the top of the front page - and thus the masthead was born.

We’ve gathered together some striking masthead examples in thisPinterest board.

A culinary tour through European newspapers

Ournewspapers collectionincludes more than 4 million newspaper issues from around 20 countries.

It shows the headlines and reporting from four centuries' historical moments such asthe sinking of the Titanic. Alongside these great moments from history are more everyday occurrences.

Looking atadverts in newspapersthrough time, we can get a sense of the daily lives people across Europe led, what we ate, drank and how we enjoyed our leisure time.

This blog takes a short culinary trip around Europe, through vintage food and drink advertisements in digitised newspapers on Europeana Newspapers.

We start, like many good meals, with an apéritif. This advert appeared in the French newspaper Oeust-Eclair newspaper in May 1937.

Skipping straight to our main course, we're going to have potatoes. This advert for potatoes appeared in Kurier Warszawski, a Polish newspaper from the collections of the National Library of Poland, in October 1916. Reinberg sells potatoes at a store or for home delivery - years before online shopping, very forward-thinking!

Butter is a traditional accompaniment for potatoes. In this meal, we'll have kunstbutter - directly translated as art butter. We know it now more as margarine. This advert is from the Brixener Chronik, the newspaper of a town in South Tyrol in northern Italy. It dates from March 1925.

After our main course, a night cap? Some champagne would be lovely. How about Monopole Champagne? This was advertised in Estonian newspaper Kaja in December 1922 - perfect for a seasonal celebration.

Or perhaps a liqueur? Wiener Liqueur, by a company called Reisinger is one of the best, and acknowledged across Europe - so says their advertisement. This appeared in Die Presse in October 1854.

A hot drink to finish? This advert for tea appeared in Finnish newspaper Wiipuri in 1908. The tea is available in well-stocked bundles, each one inspected and certified by the Chemical and Seed Inspectorate of the Agricultural Society of Wiipuri Bay.

To prepare for a good night's sleep, how about hot chocolate? This advert is for Kufferle Cocoa, the most well-known, freshest and cheapest cocoa on the market. The advert for the four-gold-medal-winning cocoa appeared in Bozner Zeitung in December 1894.

After all this rich food and drink, we may need to think of our teeth. Thankfully, advertised on the same newspaper page as Cacao Kufferle, we find this lovely toothpaste advertisement.

The end of World War I?

On this day 100 years ago, theTreaty of Versailleswas signed.  The treaty officially ended the state of war between Germany and the Allied Powers. It also imposed heavy reparations on Germany, considered by some as one of the factors leading to World War II.



The Versailles Treaty is one of the most important results of the international1919 Paris Peace Conference, during which in total five separate peace treaties were signed between the defeated states and the victors.

During the conference national borders were established (sometimes based on people’s votes) that tried to take ethnic boundaries into consideration. Although the formal peace process did not end until July 1923, there was now officially peace in Europe.

For most nations involved in the First World War, the fighting had ended after the signing of theArmistice, when on 11 November 1918 at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month, millions of soldiers laid down their guns.

However, the Armistice did not mean that life went back to normal on the Western European front, as many soldiers were forced to join the French and British armies occupying the demilitarized zones in the Rheinland in Western Germany.

Fighting continued in many places. Some nations and regions which had participated in the war as part of larger states that had now fallen apart took the opportunity to fight for independence. Others were affected by violent political turmoil and revolution. In many regions, borders were disputed.

The various peace treaties did not resolve these localised conflicts and many of these raged on in parts of Eastern Europe and the Middle East through to the early 1920s, causing millions of people to flee from the ongoing violence.

The violent events in the five years after 1918 can be seen as a continuation of the World War. There were wars between regular armies, and sometimes armies of new states on the rise: the Polish war with the Soviet Union, the Greek-Turkish war and the Romanian invasion of Hungary. And there were civil wars: in Russia, Finland, Hungary, Ireland and parts of Germany for example.

And there was more violence: German forces were fighting against Estonian and Latvian nationalists in the Baltic countries, Armenian nationalists were trying to establish a national state that reached the Caspian Sea, Italy had an interest in Fiume (Rijeka) and other parts of the future Yugoslavia.

Many of these conflicts had a social background - the revolutions and uprisings in Russia and Germany for example.

But also it was an outcome of the way in which the victors of World War I wanted to rearrange Eastern Europe and the Middle East.

There are many stories on Europeana 1914-1918 that describe various aspects of the tumultuous period after the war.

You will find the story of Arthur S Johnson was a Gunner in the Royal Horse Artillery (originally in Royal Garrison Artillery) in WWI. In 1919, at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month, he had the honour of taking part in the official Anniversary of the Armistice in front of Cologne Cathedral in the snow.

For many prisoners of war, especially those in Russia, it could take years to get home. While trying to get home, Alwin Metz was sent back several times to a prisoner of war camp in Zairkutny-Gorodok near Irkutsk. He was finally able to leave the camp in 1920 and returned home on 2 July 1920. Four days later, he was formally released from the army. On his month-long return journey to Thuringa, he kept a diary written in old Gabelsberger shorthand.

You can help us to preserve these important documents, making them readable and searchable for years to come. In our new online Transcribathon, theVersailles Run, we highlight a special selection of these stories for you to transcribe.

The Versailles Run will be held from 28 June to 31 August 2019. The eight-week long transcription marathon will showcase stories from the post-war period (1918-1923).

Alongside this special selection you may also choose to work on some of the unfinished documents. Everyone who transcribes and annotates online during the Versailles Run will be entered into a competition to win a special prize.

The life and work of the Polish filmmaker

‘It is the road that’s really interesting,’ said Krzysztof Kieślowski at his last public event before his death. ‘I think that’s just the way we are. We know where the goal is and reaching it is not really as interesting as the path. That’s very curious. I think it’s the same with films, just like with anything else…’

This blogs examines the life and work of Polish filmmaker Krzysztof Kieślowski, illustrated byrecently digitised behind-the-scenes scripts, photographs and more.

Early life

Krzysztof Kieślowski's life began in the turbulent times of World War II. He was born in German-occupied Warsaw on the 27 June in 1941. Soon afterwards, his parents left for what was then the eastern borderlands of Poland (Ukraine today).

The Kieślowski’s migration continued after the war: moving from town to town in southern Poland, as Kieślowski’s father was being treated for tuberculosis.

In 1957, he moved to Warsaw to study in State Technical Theatre Educational High School. In 1964 Krzysztof Kieślowski was accepted by the Leon Schiller National Film, Television and Theatre School in Łódź where he studied at the film directing department.

Documentary and censorship

Like most Poles during the Communist times, Kieślowski was not able to travel abroad for many years, but, as a filmmaker, he was able to travel around Poland researching his documentary films.

Kieślowski and other directors from the Documentary Film Studio in Warsaw made short films - with titles likeFabryka (Factory),Szpital (Hospital) andDworzec(Station)-  about communities and workplaces, depicting the Poland of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Each film was about a particular group of people, but, at the same time, offered a more generalized image of Poland.

Although Kieślowski was restricted in his work by censorship from the Communist state, he aimed at describing the true Poland in his documentaries. His short factual films are like poems that operate with metaphors and allusions to give the true depiction of reality.

In 1981 Kieślowski’s two films:Przypadek(Blind Chance, 1981) andKrótki dzień pracy(Short Working Day, 1981), show the clash between the communist power and underground opposition in a more open manner, and were banned by censorship. Both films present Poland when Solidarity movement is being born, with one showing archival shots of Lech Wałęsa during the famous strikes in Gdańsk shipyard in August 1980.

Collaboration and recognition

1985’s filmBez końca(No End) was a turning point of Kieślowski’s film career. The script was written by Kieślowski and Krzysztof Piesiewicz, a lawyer and later politician This was their first writing collaboration, which was to continue for all of Kieślowski's subsequent films.

Similarly, Zbigniew Preisner provided the musical score for this and most of Kieślowski's subsequent films. Cinematographer Piotr Kwiatkowski worked on two of Kieślowski's early documnentaries and returned, years later, on the Three Colours film trilogy.

Referring to the introduction of martial law in Poland in 1981,No Endtells of the aftermath of a lawyer dying, whose wife struggles to come to terms with her loss while the lawyer’s last client is imprisoned.

The film was criticized by the authorities, the underground opposition and Catholic church on its release in 1985, but today it is considered one of Kieślowski’s most powerful achievements.

Soon afterwards, Kieślowski made a series of television films inspired by the ten commandments. He made longer versions of two episodes for cinema –Krótki film o zabijaniu(A Short Film About Killing, 1988) andKrótki film o miłości(A Short Film About Love, 1988). These films gained international recognition and transformed Kieślowski’s reputation from a local film director to a world cinema auteur.

International cooperation

This new period in Kieślowski's life was marked by his international career - travelling around the world, from festival to festival. In 1988 and 1989, with his films, he visited events in Europe, North and South America. He became a kind of migratory filmmaker.

His subsequent movies were international productions, in which his focus was observing European society. After the final fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989, Kieślowski made films showing how Europeans from East and West can unite despite various experiences in the post-war history of the countries they come from.

Three Colours

Kieślowski's film output was completed with the trilogy ofThree Colours: Blue, White and Red(1993/94). The titles of the films refer to the colours of the French flag and the slogans of the French Revolutionliberte, egalite and fraternite. The films ask the question: what is freedom, equality and brotherhood in the late twentieth century?

Each of the films takes place in a different European country:Bluein France,Whitein Poland (and in France) andRedin Switzerland, with three French actresses appearing in each.  In a way, the whole trilogy of apolitical and intimate stories praise the unification of Europe.

The three-colour trilogy was a great international success.Bluewon Kieślowski the Golden Lion at the Venice International Film Festival and forWhitehe was awarded with Silver Bear at Berlinale.Redwas nominated for the Academy Awards in three categories: for best direction, screenplay and cinematography.

In 1993 Kieślowski announced that he was to retire from directing.

He passed away after heart surgery in March 1996. At his funeral, Polish philosopher and priest, Professor Józef Tischner, said:

While other artists mediated on human beings’ road to the world, he mediated on human beings’ road to themselves.

Stories from museums, galleries, libraries and archives across Europe of refugees supported through art and activism

Throughout history, people have been forced to flee their homeland - from war, from persecution, from discrimination. Departure is the one common experience among the diverse and varied experiences of refugees.

Collections in European museums, galleries, libraries and archives represent the experiences of refugees through history - from as far back as thefall of Troyto more recent conflicts such asthe Boer War,the Armenian Genocide, theaftermath of World War IIorthe war in Syria.

However, histories can be forgotten, and traces of refugee experiences can be hard to find.

Since 2010, Europeana has invited people to share theirstories and memories from World War Iand, since 2018,their stories of migration.

This blog looks at some of these stories from or about refugees as well as collections from museums, galleries, libraries and archives across Europe, looking at how refugees were and continue to be supported through art and activism, through their own activities and through those of others.

Artists as advocates

Many examples exist where artists - either individually or collectively - have advocated on behalf of refugees, raising awareness of their issues or fundraising for their assistance. Indeed, many artists, musicians, writers and more than we know today have experiences of being a refugee in their lives.

This document outlines a sale of Landscapes, Portraits and Genre Paintings in New York in 1940 which raised funds for United Jewish Appeal for Refugees.



Refugees, Cyprián Majerník, Slovak National Gallery, Public Domain Mark

During World War II, Slovakian artistCyprián Majerníkdedicated his work to depicting the horrors that people were enduring at that time. His paintings document the history of Europe and protest against Jewish and prison transports, against death marches of the time.

The 1969 World Star Festival record brought together popular recording artists of the time. The proceeds from the sales of this record fundraised for the United Nations High Commission for Refugees.

Artists as witnesses

In Ireland, since 1999, all asylum seekers and refugees live under a system called direct provision. The state directly provides housing, food and a small allowance.

Serbian photographer Vukašin Nedeljković, who has lived in Ireland since 2008, lived under direct provision when he first arrived in the country.

He began photographing and collecting memories and objects of direct provision centres across Ireland, publishing them on a website calledThe Archive Asylum. In October 2018, he published a book about the project.



The Asylum Archive, Vukašin Nedeljković via Europeana Migration, Copyright not evalauted

'It is terrible - people living under it are institutionalised', says Vukasin, 'I don't think this is an OK way to treat … people who come here seeking international protection'.

Adelshared his story at a collection day event in Ireland, also speaking about living in a direct provision centre:

[It] is miserable. It's very cold, there's no feeling to it, people just feed you and give you a bed, but they don't care. The food is terrible, the conditions are terrible, the area is very isolated. There are no facilities, no sporting facilities, no internet access.

Taking part: creating artworks

A number of stories touch on how creating and making artworks act as a form of therapy, of confronting and sensitively dealing with unhappy memories.

Marieke and Sarah told us about their experiences co-creating poetry and music with refugees.

The refugees tell their stories and together, we translate and interpret them. We want them to feel encouraged because many feel insecure about their creativity at first. Hence, we have to give people a safe space to tell their stories. We work on songs and translate the stories into music. We also blend languages as in the songs we brought today, which is in English and Arabic.

Sharing and expressing their feelings is a part of the healing process. We see poems and songs as a medium; music and art bring people together.

SB OverSeas is a non-profit organisation based in Belgium. During their programs at asylum centres in Brussels, refugee and asylum-seeker children created drawings, with one example above. These drawings reveal the traumatic experiences faced by the children and also their hopes for the future.

Sharing stories

In addition to theEuropeana Migration stories from and about refugees, other cultural heritage organisations have been gathering and sharing stories.

One example is Playground, an exhibition at theEtnografiska museetin Stockholm, which presented objects and stories of LGBTQ+ refugees in Sweden.Here you can read more about these objects and stories.

Your stories

The examples in this blog post are just a few of the many ways in which art, activism and advocacy have come together. Do you know more examples?Have you a story to tell about being a refugee or migration activism?

We'd love to hear it and record it for the future, and invited you toshare your story with Europeana Migration online here.

The cultural heritage of LGBTQ+ activism

June marks Pride month, commemorating the 1969 Stonewall riots which catalysed modern LGBTQ+ activism.



In Europe, with pride parades mostly spanning May to September, festivals, parties and protests are held across the continent throughout the summer months.

This blog looks at a short cultural history ofPride festivals, exemplified by objects held in European museums, galleries, libraries and archives - objects which also symbolise some of the current debates around Pride and its place in LGBTQ+ communities.

The modern Pride and LGBTQ+ liberation movements began in the late 1960s with theStonewall riotsin New York. These were a series of spontaneous demonstrations by members of the LGBTQ+ community against police raids of the Stonewall Inn Manhattan, which began on 28 June 1969. After the Stonewall riots, activist organisations formed, and two years later on the anniversary of the riots, the first pride marches took place in cities across the US.

In some cities, these marches are known asChristopher Street Days(marking the location of the Stonewall Inn) with the first German events taking place in Bremen and Berlin in 1979.

Through the 1970s and 1980s, LGBTQ+ movements were focused on liberation, on changing laws and opinions to over-turn inequal attitudes and discrimination faced by LGBTQ+ people.

Objects from these decades focus on identification, on legitimacy, on showing how LGBTQ+ rights are human rights.

Some objects illustrate the growing community organising and activism throughout the 1970s and 1980s, which saw campaign groups and other human rights organisations come together to fight for equality, rights and against discrimination, homophobia and transphobia.

Many of the objects featured here use a common language, symbols and signs designated act as community identifiers, as protest symbols.

One of the first symbols adopted by LGBTQ+ rights organisations, advocates and the  movement overall, was a pink triangle. Its origins represented a dark chapter in LGBTQ+ history rights, as it was used in Nazi concentration camps during World War II to identify prisoners.

Its use by LGBTQ+ advocates grew to raise awareness of its use in Nazi Germany and act as a memorial to those who had been persecuted. Over time, it increasingly became used not solely as a memorial but became reclaimed to be positive symbol of both self and community identity.

Most of the objects here show therainbow flag, a later symbol of LGBTQ+ pride and associated social movements.

Originally devised by artist Gilbert Baker from San Francisco and first used in the United States in the late 1970s, the flag is now used worldwide as a symbol of LGBTQ+ social movements as well as peace and equality.

Although other variants exist, the most common rainbow flag consists of six stripes: red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet.

Today, in many cities, Pride Festivals are just that: festivals and parties. They are attended by heterosexual, cisgender people as well as LGBT+ people.

Pride parades today often emphasise inclusiveness, an event for families and those of all faiths, races and backgrounds.

In one way, this can symbolise a greater acceptance and equality and freedom that we all feel. In other ways, many activists feel that the true meaning of Pride as a protest about human and equal rights is being overtaken and co-opted by those who simply want a fun party.

Indeed, in many cities, Pride festivals are important tourist attractions now, with businesses and organisations taking part to both show their support but also for their own commercial gain.

This bottle of Absolut vodka from Sweden illustrates this, as it features the rainbow flag on its branding. Absolut were the first spirit brand to adopt the rainbow flag. Since the 1980s, the company have supporting LGBTQ+ campaigns and charities. On the one hand, this vital financial support sustains and advances LGBTQ+ rights and issues. But, on the other hand, some campaigners see this as taking Pride further away from its protest roots and can be seen as a form of corporate 'pink-washing'.

Many of the objects featured here are ephemeral - badges, leaflets, posters - but speak to the history of Pride and stories of the LGBTQ+ community. It must be noted that cultural heritage collections don't record all stories, and Pride is experienced differently across Europe.

However you feel about Pride today - party or protest or both? - the importance of visibility, activism and pride in who you are remains as important today as it did in the 1960s.

We'd love to hear your experiences of Pride parades. Let us know in the comments.

One of Europe’s most important Byzantine cities

Ravenna in modern Italy was one of Europe’s most important cities in the Byzantine era. Today, experts from the**Byzantine Art and Archaeologyproject take us on a tour of Ravenna’s remarkable Byzantineheritage.



In 1996, UNESCO added eight early Christian monuments in Ravenna to itsWorld Heritage List. Ravenna was one of Europe’s most important cities in the Late Antique period. Between 402 - 751 CE it was the residence of the Western Roman emperors, of the Ostrogothic kings of Italy and of the Byzantine governors. During this period the city was progressively enlarged and enriched by remarkable works of art and architecture, some of which still preserved today. Ravenna became a link between the Eastern and the Western Roman Empires.

The extraordinary flourishing of mosaic art in Ravenna between the 5th and the 6th centuries CE – the golden age of the city – has left us a great number of examples from the early period of Byzantine art. As with Thessaloniki, Constantinople, Rome and Milan, mosaic became the main medium of expressing civic prestige, both as a court residence and as a prominent ecclesiastical centre. Let's explore some of Ravenna's most important Byzantine monuments.

The Neonian Baptistery was built at the beginning of the 5th century CE and thoroughly refurbished and decorated by the Bishop Neon in the years 458-460.Its interior is decorated by mosaics and stuccoes depicting prophets, the apostles and other motives alluding to the heavenly city and to the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.

Galla Placidia, daughter of the Roman Emperor Theodosius I (379-395) was regent to her son Valentinian III (423-437) and a major force in Roman politics for most of her life. Her mausoleum was built around 425-450 but it was never used for her since the empress died and was buried in the year 450 in Rome.

The mausoleum’s interior is entirely covered with Christian symbols of immortality and eternal life: for instance, the cross is used for the plan of the building itself and for various parts of the ceiling’s mosaic decoration:

Built in the first half of the 6th century CE, during the reign of the king Theoderic, of Arian beliefs, the Arian Baptistery was connected to the Arian episcopal church.

Its dome features a mosaic depicting the baptism of Christ in the river Jordan, surrounded by the twelve Apostles who pay homage to the Holy Cross covered by a purple shroud – a symbol of the Passion and of the physical nature of Jesus (a central belief in the Arian faith). On the external circular band the procession of the Apostles is depicted, led in separate directions and meeting at the empty throne (theEtimasia):

The Basilica of Sant’Apollinare Nuovo (first quarter of the 6th century CE) was the king Theoderic’s Palatine church. The glory and power of the Gothic king was represented in the panels depicting the Palatium, the royal court, the city of Ravenna and the post of Classe:

Under Justinianic rule, the mosaics were modified by removing the figures connected to Theoderic and by incorporating them into the Catholic tradition with triumphal processions of saints, virgins, the Virgin Mary and Jesus Christ.

Dating to the first half of the 6th century, the Basilica of Sant’Apollinare in Classe was built on the foundations of the primitive burial place of Apollinaris, the first bishop and founder of the Church of Ravenna. Sant’Apollinare in Classe is famous for its apsidal mosaics and for the marble sarcophagi of the local archbishops along the side naves.

The construction of the Basilica of San Vitale (built 527-548) shows as important influence of the Eastern Mediterranean art, both in the church structure (a central octagonal plan surmounted by a large dome) and in the iconography of the mosaics.

The mosaic decorations from the Basilica of San Vitale presbytery include the following personages [l-r]: 1. Bishop Maximinian and Giuliano Argentario, 2. detail of the Empress Theodora, 3. detail of the Emperor Justinian:

The life and legacy of Aleksandras Mykolas Račkus

Aleksandras Mykolas Račkuswas a Lithuanian American numismatist, philatelist, ethnographer, curator, and physician, who was born near Kaunas in 1893.



In 1910, he travelled to the United States, where he started his education in St. Laurent College in Canada, Montreal. He later studied at Holy Cross College in Worcester, the University of Loyola and the Medical School in Chicago where he obtained an MD in surgery.

From 1922, he practised as a doctor. He was an active member of the Lithuanian diaspora, who dedicated his life to strengthening Lithuanian communities abroad, and retaining strong connections to his home country.

Račkus belonged to various cultural organisations, doing his part as an editor and publisher for the Lithuanian press.

Already by 1917, he founded the Lithuanian Museum of Numismatics and History in Chicago. The main goals of this association were to gather Lithuanian antiquities and documents important to the country’s history.

In 1935, the First World Congress of Lithuanians took place in Kaunas. On this occasion Račkus organised an exhibition with his own collection, which featured old Lithuanian publications, flags of Lithuanian organisations, badges, uniforms, photographs attesting to cultural life of Lithuanian-Americans, archaeological finds and more.

He eventually sold his collection (about 81,000 items) for a symbolic fee to the Ministry of Education of Lithuania and founded the Vytautas Magnus Museum of Culture.

Račkus returned to live in Lithuania from 1936 to 1940. He opened a private medical practice and worked at the museum. In 1940 he returned to Chicago, where he founded the Museum of Lithuanian Studies, wrote on Lithuanian topics, and actively engaged in numismatics.

Next to being a numismatic enthusiast with a heart for Lithuanian culture, Račkus was also somewhat of an artist himself. He is known to have created a set of colorful Christmas greeting cards, in keeping with the patriotic, religious and numismatic themes that fascinated him so much. Again, these depictions of Lithuanian symbols or coins were intended as a way to raise awareness of his native country. Račkus was gifted as a political cartoonist as well. His anti-Soviet cartoons were well known in Lithuanian communities around the world.

Račkus died in 1965 in Chicago. Today, his collection is regarded as instrumental for the study and reconstruction of Lithuanian cultural life in emigration at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries.

We face a crisis and people are calling ever louder for urgent actions

Today global awareness of the human impact on the environment is at an all-time high.

No matter where you turn, you cannot escape it, whether it’s on social media, TV, or actually, right in front of you - we’ve all seen the schoolchildren striking and demanding governments to listen to the extreme temperatures and weather shifts we all face around the world.

We push harder than ever for equal human rights regardless of sexual orientation, gender or skin colour. We fight to prevent the extinction of diverse species as well as the basic rights of the ones we consume and exploit for labour, for science, for clothes and cosmetics.

In all these fights, we face a crisis. What we are doing is impacting the very earth we call home and the animals and plants sharing it with us.

Throughout human existence we’ve been shaping our environment to suit our specific needs whether for shelter, food, or to travel.

We’ve modified the world to suit ourselves. It’s only quite recently that we have started to question how that affects the environment around us.

It’s become apparent that when people travel, they introduce different species to different environments, sometimes wiping out the native fauna and flora.

Feeding the world’s huge population has meant animal-rearing and massive lands transformed from wild forests to plains upon plains used for crops and cattle. 18 million acres of forest are lost each year. Man-made deforestation and agriculture being the leading cause.

We’ve taken over the world and keep growing in numbers, meaning we need more and more land to build on, leaving less and less natural land available for our compatriots who constantly need to adapt themselves to us in order to survive.

Human equality, the same rights for everyone, we’ve been chanting this, but are we are not yet all equal.

In numerous countries, wages for women are still not the same as men, with only six countries giving equal working rights to both men and women.

People of colour with the same qualifications as their white counterparts still struggle to get hired. If you are disabled, even less likely.

If you are part of the LGBTQ+ community, you can fear for your life in most countries around the world to this day, and forget about same-sex marriage, in 73 countries it is still illegal.

Let’s face it. We are Earth’s worst nightmare.

We have caused so many species to go extinct and to be critically threatened. In 2019, around 16,306 animals and plants are endangered, 99% of them because of human activities.

We can no longer ignore that the Earth is suffering, we are suffering. The people are calling ever louder to be heard and for urgent actions this time around because it’s on us.

But people have incredible powers to make change, individual and en masse. Read our next blog abouthistorical figures around the world who have made a great difference to their environment.

How the history of New York's Saint Patrick's Cathedral reflects the city's migration history

For thousands of migrants looking for a job or a new start in life, New York City has always been (and still is) a favoured destination. Many live together in specific neighbourhoods, aiding them in finding work, engaging in social activities and preserving their cultural identity.

The history and culture of New York City is entwined with migration, encapsulated in buildings like theLower East Side Tenement Museumand Saint Patrick's Cathedral.

Saint Patrick's Cathdral is a symbol of Catholic faith in the USA, and reflects the migrant heritage and communities that made up New York.

Since the mid-1800s Mulberry Street has been a centre of the Italian community in New York, the majority of this community are Catholic. An existing church - the Old Saint Patrick Church - became too small to house the growing number of worshippers, so a new gathering place was built.

James Renwick, who already had designed New York’s Grace Church (1843–46), was the architect of the new Neo-Gothic, two-tower structure for which construction began in 1858.

For his cathedral, Renwick devised an eclectic, monumental building style mixing French, German and English Gothic influences. Named after the patron saint of Ireland, the building was completed in 1878 and became the seat of the Archdiocese.

Since its construction, Saint Patrick’s Cathedral has become a meeting place for immigrants and has become one of the best known and most visited churches of the United States.

The cathedral - which takes up an entire block - is built of brick covered with marble, sourced in Massachusetts and New York.

Its lavish decorations reflect the migration history of local communities. The doors, for instance, are adorned with sculptures of saints and religious figures connected to the history of migration.

St. Isaac Jogueswas New York's first Catholic priest, who was born in France.St. Frances Xavier Cabriniwas the founder of the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, who supported Italian immigrants in the US.Saint Kateri Tekakwithaor ‘the Lily of the Mohawks’: a missionary in New France of Algonquin–Mohawk birth, and the first Native American woman to be canonised by the Catholic Church.Mother Elizabeth Setonwas a descendant from a family that ranked among the earliest European settlers in the New York area, founder of the Sisters of Charity and first native-born U.S. citizen to be canonised.

Through the communities that worship there, and the figures it features, Saint Patrick's Cathedral is an architectural celebration of New York’s multiculturalism.

From Expressionism to Functionalism

Bauhaus-Dessau

End of Bauhaus?

2019 celebrates the centenary of the influential Bauhaus art and design school, founded by architect Walter Gropius in Weimar Germany on 12 April 1919.



The Bauhaus made a huge impact on the art and architecture of the 20th century, in spite of its short 14-year existence. This was largely due to the network of teachers and students of the school, who continued to put their ideas into practice for decades after the institute closed in 1933.

‘A world has been destroyed; we must seek a radical solution,’ said the young architectWalter Gropiusupon his return from World War I in late 1918.

In 1919, Gropius founded the Staatliches Bauhaus Weimar, with ambitious plans in mind. He wanted to bring diverse disciplines such as art, architecture and crafts together under one roof. In this way, Gropius hoped to bridge the gap between artists and artisans.

The idea behind this was to combine the beautiful with the useful.

In Gropius' vision, the Bauhaus school would produce a new generation of architects and designers, producing both functional and elegant homes and utensils. These creations would become available to everyone. In this way, art would also come within reach of the ‘common man’.

Fine art became a major offering at the school with free painting classes offered by artists likePaul KleeandWassily Kandinsky. Instruction focused less on function (like so many Bauhaus offerings) and more on abstraction. Modernist movements in the arts like Expressionism and Futurism would have a noticeable influence on the art produced in the school alongside its specific style of geometric design.

Under the leadership of Gropius, the Bauhaus movement made no special distinction between the applied and fine arts. Painting, typography, architecture, textile design, furniture-making, theatre design, stained glass, woodworking, metalworking—these all found a place there.

The philosophy of the school changed dramatically during these years. It started out with a very expressionist philosophy, meaning subjective and personal, combined with an artisanal outlook.

Later, this was supplemented considerably with opposing ideas about ‘functionalist’ design and a more positive view on industrialised manufacturing by ‘radicals’ like Dutch artistTheo van Doesburg(De Stijl) and HungarianLászló Moholy-Nagy.

Starting in 1925, Gropius oversaw the school’s move to Dessau, creating an opportunity to put the principles of Bauhaus functionalism into practice, and to be part of the school’s physical space. He designed the Bauhaus Building and several other buildings for the new campus in concrete, steel and glass.

In 1928, Gropius stepped down as head of the Bauhaus in favour of Hannes Meyer, who in turn was succeeded in 1930 by LudwigMies van der Rohe.

In the meantime the political situation in Germany deteriorated. The Nazi party, rising to power through the 1930s, opposed the Bauhaus and marked it as a promoter of ‘Entartete Kunst’ (degenerated art).

In 1932, the Nazi party cancelled the Bauhaus’ funding preventing further teaching. Hoping to continue, Mies van der Rohe moved the school to an empty telephone factory in Berlin and designated it a private institution. The faculty flatly refused to work with the Nazis, and rather than cooperate with them, the faculty voted to close the school in 1933.

In the following months, a large part of the Bauhaus members fled the repressive climate in Germany. Some emigrated to the United States, including Gropius, Moholy-Nagy and Mies van der Rohe. Here they again focused on both architecture and education, where they integrated Bauhaus methods into the curriculum of architecture schools.

Partly because of this exodus, the ideas of the Bauhaus continue to live on, and its influence on architecture, product design and more is still visible today.

WhileAntonín Dvorákis sometime considered as the greatest composer ever to have lived in the Czech Republic, in the eyes of the Czechs only one man deserves that epithet: Bedřich Smetana.



Smetana was born in 1824 into a fairly prosperous family as the son of a brewer. From a young age, Smetana excelled in music and he was sent away to study in Prague, where he indulged in the capital’s rich cultural life.

By the time that Smetana travelled to Pilsen in 1840, he had already composed for string quartet but he began to focus more on the piano. He considered his3 Impromptus(1841) to be the real start of his career.

In 1844, Smetana began studying in Prague. He tried to earn a living as a piano teacher but hardly managed to make ends meet. However, Franz Liszt's acceptance of the dedication of hisOpus 1(1848) was encouraging. Smetana opened a music institute, which allowed him to continue teaching and save enough to start a family with Kateřina Kolářová.

The following years were marked by economic difficulties and a personal tragedy: the death of three of the couple’s daughters.

Despite these misfortunes, Smetana dedicated himself to supporting a Czech national revival after theuprisingin Prague. But when reforms failed to arrive, he moved with his family to Sweden, where he was offered a job in Gothenburg – the nation’s second-largest city.

The favourable impression of his early months in Sweden prompted Smetana to consider settling there for good. His wife’s poor health and his feelings of artistic isolation, however, made him decide to return to Prague in the spring of 1859. The journey ended in tragedy when his wife passed away during the trip.

Smetana married again and brought his second wife, Bettina Ferdinandová, to Sweden. His compositions from this time – such as the symphonic poemsRichard III(1858),Wallenstein's Camp(1859) andHakon Jarl(1861) – garnered much criticism. But Smetana remained focused on his masterplan: to make a big comeback in Prague.

When the Provisional Theatre announced a contest for playwrights and composers, Smetana knew his moment of glory was near. He submitted the operaBrandenburgers in Bohemia(Braniboři v Čechách, 1866) and won the competition, instantly becoming a celebrity. At 42, his career had finally taken off. He became the Director of the Provisional Theatre, where he furthered the establishment of a ‘Czech national school’ while expanding the international repertoire as well. He himself continued writing opera’s such asDalibor(1868) andDvě vdovy(The Two Widows, 1874).

All in all, Smetana’s time as a theatre director was disputed but fruitful, resulting among others in the first plans for his magnum opusMá vlast(My Country, c.1872-9). This orchestral cycle, consisting of six symphonic poems, unfolds a narrative about the history, mythology and landscape of Bohemia. Navigating along mythical rock masses (Vyšehrad), Bohemian fields and forests (Z českých luhů a hájů) and the magical mountain Blaník, this was Smetana's 'multidimensional' portrait of his homeland.

The second movement Moldau (Vltava) in particular has entered the classical canon as one of the strongest exponents of Czech national style and a brilliant example of 'topographical music'.Má vlastlaunched Smetana to stardom and became a national hymn: a remarkable conclusion to a story of which the Swedish chapter is often forgotten.

Throughout the world, the love, patience, dedication and commitment of mothers are honoured yearly on ‘Mother’s Day’. Many countries and cultures celebrate their mothers in the month of May, and treat the ‘leading lady’ of the family to a day of pampering, presents, festive food and extra doses of hugs. But did you know that ‘Mother’s Day’ as we know it, is rooted in traditions going back as far as ancient times?



In Ancient Greece, a mother cult encompassing specific rituals and ceremonies was dedicated to Rhea - the Mother of the Gods. Phrygians, too, held a festival for their earth-mother equivalent, Cybele, while the Ancient-Indian Hindus revered the goddess Durga as the motherly power at the source of life and all creation with the Durga-puja festival.

In the Christian faith, Mary, mother of Jesus Christ, has been at the centre of worship practices for many centuries. In 1330 Spain started to worship the Immaculate Virgin and in 1854 Pope Pious IX declared the Immaculate Conception to be doctrine. In many countries still, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception is celebrated yearly on December 8.

Another precursor to Mother’s Day is so-called ‘Laetare’, ‘Refreshment Sunday’ or ‘Mothering Sunday’: a Christian holiday celebrated in the UK halfway Lent. From the Middle Ages onward, it became customary to visit one’s ‘mother church’ and one’s parents on this very day.

The modern, secular concept of a ‘Mother’s Day’ emerged in the United States in the late 19th century. In 1870, Philadelphia judge Julia Ward Howe issued a “Mother’s Day Proclamation” asking mothers to unite in promoting world peace. Three years later, she campaigned for a “Mother’s Peace Day” to become an annual event.

A more widespread usage came into place after 1907, when West-Virginian activist Anna Marie Jarvis began promoting Mother's Day as an occasion to show appreciation for the role and work of mothers. In the years before the Civil War, Jarvis’ own mother had worked in so-called “Mothers’ Day Work Clubs”: groups offering support and education to local women, that would become a unifying force in a region divided over the War. In 1868 she even organized a “Mothers’ Friendship Day”: an event aiming at the reconciliation of former Union and Confederate soldiers.

Establishing a formal Mother’s Day was Anna Marie Jarvis’ way of honoring her mother’s accomplishments. At the same time, she wanted to raise awareness of the sacrifices made by mothers, and to counter-balance the many existing holidays inspired by male achievements. Carnations soon became the symbol of the celebration, as a representation of the purity of a mother’s love. To this day, many cultures (such as the Japanese) offer carnations as a Mother’s Day present.

Owing to Jarvis’ commitment to the cause, Mother’s Day became a widespread phenomenon. It turned into a nation-wide celebration in 1914, when President Woodrow Wilson allocated an annual, national holiday honoring mothers to every second Sunday of May. In a short time span, Mother’s Day evolved from a day of honor to a highly commercialized day centered around gifts and cards. This would become a source of frustration to Anna Marie Jarvis, who would end up trying relentlessly to have the holiday scrapped – to no avail.

Because in the meantime, the whole world had adopted the Mother’s Day tradition, sometimes adhering to the second Sunday of May, in other cases developing separate practices.

Many countries - among which Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova and Armenia - celebrate their mothers on the 8th of March, thereby merging the holiday with International Women’s Day. In France, celebrations are held on the last Sunday of May or the first of June, while Spain and Portugal honor mothers on the very first Sunday of May. In Norway, Mother's Day is always celebrated on the second Sunday of February, while in Serbia it takes place in December during a series of holidays including Children's Day and Father's Day.

A peculiar tradition is that of Antwerp, Belgium - a city that is considered to be somewhat of a maverick by the rest of the country. Since 1913, Mother’s Day is celebrated here on August 15, coinciding with the feast of Mary’s Ascension. Mary is the patroness of Antwerp and was annually celebrated with a procession on this day. Frans Van Kuyck, Alderman of Fine Arts on the City Council of turn-of-the-century Antwerp, saw in Mary the symbol of strong family values: a notion that he hold very dear, as he considered modern society with its growing industrialization and individualism to be in danger of losing its backbone.

By stressing the importance of the role of the mother, Van Kuyck hoped to strengthen ethics and preserve valuable traditions. To this end, he installed a propaganda team to deploy an impressive publicity campaign, and scripted the celebrations up to the finest detail, including instructions on which jewels to buy, which decorations to apply, breads to bake and poetry to write...  To this day, citizens of Antwerp remain the only Belgians who don’t join in for the nation-wide Mother’s Day celebration on the second Sunday of May.

Whatever one might think of the concept of celebrating mothers once a year (instead of every single day) or of the feast of commerce that the holiday has turned into, there’s much to be said for mothers deserving their very own, very special day. Because occasions like these create focus and time for reflection. They allow us to acknowledge and strengthen family ties. And most importantly: they are the ultimate stimulus for giving credit to those, who often fade into the background, always putting their loved ones first.

'Weave the pattern of your life'

Processing the war experience with solidarity

An international initiative

In the aftermath of World War 2, after the liberation of The Netherlands from German occupation in May 1945 and the festivities that followed, many Dutch women made special commemorative skirts, called ‘nationale feestrok’ or 'bevrijdingsrok' in Dutch - the latter translates as liberation skirts in English. The idea behind this festive garment came fromMies Boissevain-Van Lennep.

During the war, for her resistance activities during the occupation, Mies had been imprisoned and sent to a concentration camp. Shortly after her arrest in 1943, she was sent a scarf made of textile patches from garments of relatives and friends, which brought back special memories.

After the war, Mies was a member of a women's group that decided to create agarment to celebrate the rebuilding of the Netherlandsafter the war. For this, the liberation skirt had great symbolic value.

The commemorative skirt had to meet certain conditions - the old but colourful patches had to be sewn on to an older skirt so that the original background disappeared and a new colourful piece of clothing was created. Today, we would call it upcycling.

The hem had to consist of equal triangles with the date ’5 May 1945’ and the dates of national holidays on which the skirt was worn sewn into it. The wearer could also wear the skirt on other important events or celebrations and commemorate those events on their skirts.

Those creating a skirt were to ‘weave the pattern of your life into your skirt,’ asa song composed in honour of the ideaput it.

The philosophy behind the patchwork skirts was, on the one hand, that the use of the fabric remnants represented the reconstruction and renewal of the Netherlands, while on the other hand, that women could process their own war experiences during the crafts.

Wearing the skirts together would reinforce the feeling of solidarity among women. The skirts looked alike, but each was different. The idea was that you should not be able to see differences in the social position of the wearers.

A liberation skirt only became a ‘National commemorative skirt’ if it was officially registered. In the end, around 4,000 skirts were registered. The highlight of the phenomenon was in September 1948, in celebration of the Golden Jubilee of the reign of Queen Wilhelmina when hundreds of women wore their commemorative skirts for a parade in Amsterdam and across the parliament courtyard in The Hague.

Because of the success of her initiative, Mies travelled through the United States in 1949 at the request of The Netherlands Information Bureau (NIB) for a propaganda trip about ‘Woman's life in the Netherlands of Today’.

She visited 27 states and spoke at many occasions always putting the commemorative skirt and its philosophy at the centre of her talks. She sincerely hoped that the ‘Magic Skirts of Reconstruction’ (as they were called on one occasion) would become an international symbol for female values around the world. The American media at the time, however, described her work solely as a peace initiative and neglected the aspect of female solidarity she promoted.

Although the skirts did not become a worldwide phenomenon as Mies hoped, and the interest in The Netherlands waned after a while, this does not mean that the commemorative skirt disappeared completely.

Skirts were known to be worn onLiberation Dayup to the 1980s and in 1981 a provincial museum in Ede organised the first exhibition around the ‘Nationale Feestrok’. During the following decades, the commemorative skirt found a place in the collective memory of Dutch society through the work of memory institutions and researchers.

Czech composerAntonín Dvořákbrought his sensibility and musical genius from his homeland to the United States.

In his career, 19th century Czech composerBedrich Smetana, the founding father of the great Czech symphonic tradition, wanted to establish a strong, ambitious and idiosyncratic national repertoire. Instead of an international career, he dedicated his life to the recognition and development of the Czech arts.

Antonín Dvořák appeared on the scene, almost 20 years after Smetana, when this effort had largely been achieved. While Dvořák was a patriot - highly valuing the Czech identity of his art - at the same time, he was eager to share his creations with the whole world.

So it was no coincidence that the aptly namedSlavonic dancesearned Dvořák international fame.

Contrary to what the title might suggest, the dances are not so much inspired by Slavic folk music generally, but specifically by styles and forms from Bohemia.

In these pieces, Dvořák never actually quotes folk melodies, but evokes their style and spirit by using traditional rhythmic patterns and structures in keeping with traditional folk dances. The result is music that breathes the atmosphere of his native country. In 1886, Dvořák published a second set of Slavonic dances, which again were a roaring success.

Dvořák ’s growing fame landed him a unique new assignment.

In 1891, Jeannette Thurber, Director of the National Conservatory of Music in America (the forerunner of the Juilliard School) asked him to become the artistic director and professor of composition.

Dvořák was chosen because he had contributed to the crystallization of Czech identity through his music. Thurber dreamed of an American classical music repertoire that would have a similarly strong identity.

Dvořák accepted the assignment and left for New York with his wife and children in September 1892.

In the next period, Dvořák devoted himself to his task: he collected and studied a wide range of American musical traditions and idiosyncrasies. He asked an Afro-American student to come and sing spirituals, and enrolled a critic who provided transcriptions of Indian-American melodies, all contributing to the codification of the DNA of American music.

What Dvořák ended up with was, in fact, an alphabet reflecting the essential elements of a much broader repertoire of folk music, spanning multiple cultures and continents. The composer would go on to draw from this alphabet to create new music that was unconventional and consciously different.

Dvořák’s compositions from this period include the string quartets B179 and B180, the piano suite in A B184 and his 9th and final symphony, titled ‘From the New World’ (1893). This celebrated symphony was actually Dvořák 's first work responding to the high expectations of Mrs. Thurber, and it was no coincidence that he chose the symphony as the genre for this work.

By using the form in which legendary masters such as Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert had established themselves, Dvořák wanted to offer leverage to American musical heritage and help lift it into the great romantic orchestral tradition.

In this symphony, the Dvořákian 'impression' of American music is blended with Slavic elements to create a colourful and unique artistic statement that can be enjoyed on many different levels. One of its most notable features is the slow movement, theLargo, boasting one of the most famous themes in music history.

Even if you’ve never intently listened to this Largo, you are likely to recognise its melody. It was used on the soundtrack of the filmCrimes of Passionand it’s so popular in Japan that’s it’s considered part of its national musical heritage. In the U.K. many people will associate the melody with an advertisement for Hovis bread.

The symphony was a runaway success which landed Dvořák a two-year contract extension at the Conservatory.

Unfortunately, the bankruptcy of the Thurbers shattered those dreams. When Dvořák returned to America after a short holiday in Bohemia, everything seemed to have changed: he was homesick, struggled with his creativity, and lacked the peace and happiness he had felt in his homeland.

The following year he returned to the Czech Republic for good. A letter in which he waived his final salary from the Conservatory concluded his extraordinary adventure on American soil.

The majority of the Lithuanian diaspora live in the United States

Lithuania has long been a nation of immigrants, with the majority of the Lithuanian diaspora living in the United States. In this blog, Giedrė Milerytė-Japertienė of the Martynas Mažvydas National Library of Lithuania describes Lithuanian-American life through digitised photographs and ephemera from the library's collections.

At the end of the 19th century, Lithuanian immigrants constituted the biggest group among the Eastern European nations living abroad. Although the geopolitical situation prevented Lithuania from establishing its own state until 1918, Lithuanians maintained their cultural and linguistic identity both in and outside Lithuania.

One of the first known Lithuanians to migrate to America was Karolis Aleksandras Kuršius (Alexander Carolus Curtius) in 1659, a headmaster of the first Latin school in New Amsterdam (today New York).

Those who emigrated in the 19th century were mostly driven to leave for economic reasons. But there were also other reasons, such as political persecution,Russification, and long military service in the Tsarist army.

Lithuanians migrated far and wide - many moved to the United States, about 4,000 Lithuanians emigrated to England and Canada, and 8,000 to Scotland as well as people moving to South Africa andBrazil.

In the 19th century, the generation ofgrynoriaiestablished themselves in the US. The namegrynoriaioriginated from the English term “greenhorn,” defining a person who is new to or inexperienced in unfamiliar situations, in this case, a foreign country.

Lithuanian diaspora researchers claim that the number of Lithuanians who arrived in the US from 1880 to 1914 could have been from 300,000 to 600,000. Since Lithuania as a country did not exist at the time, those arriving were recorded as either Polish or Russian.

They were mostly penniless, poorly-educated rural people who had very low cultural needs and expectations. In the United States, they first settled near the coal mines in the state of Pennsylvania and worked in sewing factories in New England (Baltimore and Boston) or Chicago stockyards.

Working hard, Lithuanians saved money, built churches, organised societies, clubs, political, social, religious, and sports organisations.

The first Lithuanian newspaper,Gazieta lietuviška(1879) was published in the United States. The first Lithuanian play, a comedy “Be sumnenės” (Empty-headed) by A. Turskis was performed in Plymouth, MA (1889), and the first wind orchestra was founded (1887) in Shenandoah, PA.

Lithuanian emigration showed great interest in science, progress, and culture. They actively participated in ethnic culture, economic and political life. Well-to-do Lithuanians started to run their own businesses, publish newspapers and books.

In the long run, Lithuanian emigrants established themselves abroad, gained great cultural and economic power and had a significant cultural, moral and economic influence on the life of Lithuania. This influence was expressed not only through personal contacts but also economic and cultural relations with the homeland.

After Lithuania regained its independence, Lithuanian-Americans supported Lithuania politically, diplomatically and economically. They invested a lot of their capital in Lithuania, maintained close relations with the country, and continued to foster Lithuanian culture in their new countries by organising public lectures, discussions, political and entertainment events.

The Tourist

The Researcher

The Historian

The French explorerPaul Belloni Du Chaillu(1831-1903) reported on his travels in the lands of the midnight sun in his illustrated and well-documented account of life in Northern Europe.

Also a seasoned explorer of Africa, in the 1870s Paul Du Chaillu changed track and travelled through the Nordic countries. He wrote several books about them, includingThe Land of the Midnight Sun, published in 1881. A year later it appeared asLe Pays du soleil de minuitin French.

This is a surprising book in many ways.

He starts by describing the rise of tourism in the region, and praising the comfort of the countries he passes through: 'The traveller is surprised to meet so many comfortable farms...'

He lists the fares for the boat trips he takes and comments on the food served to travellers, both in Stockholm and in the most remote areas. He also visits what have already become must-see sites on the tourist trail, such as impressive waterfalls and North Cape.

However, Du Chaillu is especially careful to show that he isn't a tourist: 'At this time of the year the crowd of tourists has disappeared'.

Rather, he sees himself as a traveller looking to get away from the beaten track: 'I had finished my summer rambling in out-of-the-way places, unknown to the throng of tourists'. He is also quite proud of surprising the locals: 'All wondered why I wished to go so far away from my home to indulge in sight-seeing'.

Du Chaillu’s travels had, in fact, scientific purposes.

He writes as much about the plant life and geology of the regions he visits as about the size of the herds on the farms. This is because he had also gone there as an ethnologist 'to study the home life of the Scandinavians'. He was interested in all aspects of everyday life, stating that 'as usual, I had made myself one of the people'.



Stabbur in Norway: "Among the most characteristic styles of building on these old farms is the stabbur, where the wearing apparel and stores of the family are generally kept.", 'The Land of the Midnight Sun', vol. 1, p. 419, Paul Belloni Du Chaillu. Bibliothèque nationale de France, No Copyright – Other Known Legal Restrictions

He was also interested inrural architecture, which he describes in detail but without falling into the easy admiration of the exotic. For example, of fishing huts he says:

The surroundings were filthy; entrails and heads of fish had been cast at random around the place, and two barrels were partly filled with those that had been salted, and their rotten smell was anything but pleasant.

The Land of the Midnight Sun, vol. 1, p. 82

His view is sometimes ambivalent, a mix of condescension and admiration, for instance when he says of Norway: "in this primitive land there is perfect social equality".

It is, however, thearchaeologyand population history of the Scandinavian countries that he spends the most time describing. He devotes a long chapter to the "prehistoric races of Scandinavia". This part is richly illustrated with plates of tombs, pottery and carved stones.

He built this bridge for his soul's welfare and he was the owner of the whole of Täby. God save his soul.", 'The Land of the Midnight Sun', vol. 1, p. 372 Bibliothèque nationale de France, No Copyright – Other Known Legal Restrictions

'The Land of the Midnight Sun' is the account of a traveller who was curious about everything. Some of Du Chaillu's remarks remind us that certain practices are ancient: for example, cows used to be fed fish in Norway, long before the mad cow disease crisis.

Hungary reached the football World Cup final in 1954 and, although they didn’t win, its Hungarian national team of the 1950s became legendary. This is the story of Ferenc ‘Pancho’ Puskás and the ‘Golden Team’ generation which made its mark on Spanish football.



In the post-war era, Hungary’s national football team was supported and promoted by the CommunistHungarian People's Republic. In the wake of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, however, the eleven players of its national team were scattered throughout the world.

The majority of the team played for the club sideBudapest Honvéd, who played Athletic Bilbao in the 1956–57 European Cup. Honvéd lost the away leg 3–2 but, before the home leg could be played, the Hungarian Revolution erupted in Budapest.

The players decided against going back to Hungary, so the return leg was relocated to the Heysel Stadium in Brussels. When Honvéd were eliminated 6–5 on aggregate, the Hungarian players were left in limbo. They summoned their families from Budapest and organised a fundraising tour of Italy, Portugal, Spain, and Brazil. After returning to Europe, the Hungarian players parted ways and several of them began club careers in Spain.

Ferenc Puskás, the outstanding player of the Golden Team, did not return home to Hungary. From 1958 to 1966 he played for Real Madrid in Spain. In his first two years there, Puskás was banned byFIFA(under political pressure) from playing football. Struggling with excess weight and at 30, already an ageing footballer, Puskás nonetheless strived to rebuild his career and his fitness.

After his defection, the Communist regime’s beloved star Puskás became its enemy. Hungarian state security launched treason proceedings against Puskás and opened a file on him called "Wanderer" (this file was opened on 20 May 1958 and closed on 26 June 1972).

Despite the odds being stacked against him, Puskás played for Real Madrid throughout his thirties. His training and hard work bore fruit. In this second phase of his career, he scored many goals and dazzled the world with his skills.

Puskás was not the only Hungarian footballer to find success in Spain. The FC Barcelona playersLászló Kubala(), Zoltán Czibor andSándor Kocsiswere also revered. Like Puskás, they had arrived in Spain after the 1956 Revolution, and restarted their careers there.

These Hungarian players became legends of theEl Clásicoderby matches between club rivals Real Madrid and FC Barcelona. Kubala scored twice in thirteen matches against Real Madrid, and Kocsis scored twice in three. Madrid’s beloved ‘Pancho’ (his Spanish nickname) Puskás celebrated eight victories in ten matches, and nine goals in total against Barcelona in the championship. His shots on goal were likened to cannon fire in Catalonia.

Back in Hungary, however, news of Puskás’s success was suppressed by the Communist system for years. In spite of this, the glory of the Golden Team and the cult of Puskás grew stronger over time. The captain of the Golden Team returned home for the first time in 1981 when he played a gala match against England. Puskás later worked as a coach in North and South America, Spain, Greece, and Egypt.

Puskás returned to Hungary in 1991 and lived the rest of his life there until his death in 2006. After the fall of Communism, Puskás became widely remembered as one of the greatest footballers of all time. In 2002 Budapest’s People's Stadium was renamed the Ferenc Puskás Stadium, and in 2020, on the same site, European Championship matches will be played in a new arena - the Puskás Arena.

From Russia with love

Misia Sert was one of the most intriguing and influential women inBelle Époque Paris, a muse and confidant to many of the iconic artists and composers of the time.

Marie Sophie Olga Zénaïde Godebska (known by the Polish diminutive Misia) was born in 1872, in an estate just outside of Saint Petersburg. Her parents were the Polish sculptorCyprien Godebskiand the Russian-Belgian cellist Sophie Servais, whose father was legendary Stradivarius-playing cellistAdrien-François Servais.

After her mother had passed away in childbirth, Misia was sent to live with family in Brussels. There she became acquainted with piano music from family friendFranz Liszt; she later took piano lessons withGabriel Fauréin Paris.

Misia moved to Paris with her first husband, Tadeusz Natanson, founder of the literary and art magazineLa Revue Blanche. There, Misia became the muse and the pivot of the artistic group associated with the magazine, including major authors like Proust and Mallarmé, and iconic artists such as Monet and Renoir.

Seeking funding forLa Revue Blanche, Natanson approached newspaper magnate Alfred Edwards, whom she was having an affair with. Edwards agreed to fundLa Revue Blancheon the condition that he and Misia got married. Thus, Edwards became Misia’s second husband but this marriage – like her third to Catalan painter José Maria Sert – ended in infidelity and divorce.

Misia was an influential member of a vibrant Parisian milieu involving artists, musicians, composers, designers and writers. Her lifelong confidant Maurice Ravel dedicated several compositions to her. Misia was the business partner, artistic touchstone and best friend of Serge de Diaghilev – founder and impresario of theBallets Russes.

Contemporary artists such asToulouse-Lautrec,Renoir,VuillardandVallotonall portrayed Misia. Proust called her "a monument of history" and transfigured her complex personality into two female protagonists inA la recherche du temps perdu: the manipulative Madame Verdurin and her inseparable friend, Princesse Yourbeletieff.

Jean Cocteau devoted hisThomas l'lmposteurandLes Monstres sacrésto Misia, and she was good friends withCoco Chanel, bonding through the tragedies in their lives. Chanel and Misia travelled to the United States together, exploring the art scene and the nightlife. Amidst this extraordinary company, Misia carried herself with style, charm and wit.

Misia passed away in Paris in 1950. After a ceremony at the Polish church in Paris, where Coco Chanel paid her respects by lovingly preparing Misia’s body for the funeral, she was buried in the Cimetiere de Samoreau.

Dancer, spy and freedom fighter

Born into poverty, Josephine Baker reached heights beyond what could have been possible for an African-American woman between the 20s and 60s. She was a polarising force throughout her life as a performer and activist. Seen as a threat to the United States for speaking out against race discrimination, she was loved in France - a country she performed in and would later call home, and whose people honoured her for her bravery during WWII.  Instilling fear in one nation, she captivated audiences in another.



Josephine Baker (1906-1975) was born Freda Josephine McDonald in St.Louis Missouri. Her mother was adopted by former slaves of Native American and African descent, but she never got to learn the true identity of her father. She and everyone around her suspected he was a white man but her mother took that information to the grave. This theory seems plausible as her mother was admitted to an all-white female hospital for six weeks and gave birth to her there. It is also said that she had worked for a German family right before she got pregnant.

As a child, Baker earned a living for her poverty-stricken family by working as a domestic maid then eventually giving short dance performances on the streets of  St. Louis.

Baker’s teen years were filled with street performances with various groups. As a teen, she went through two marriages, the latter one giving her the name Baker, which she kept as it was associated with her growing success as a dancer.

By the age of 19, she went on tour in Paris and became famous for her practically nude performance wearing only a banana skirt. She found her success touring Europe and became a French citizen in 1937.

During the outbreak of WWII, Josephine played an important role collecting information on German troops at parties she attended. Her career as an entertainer allowed her to move around Europe carrying secret information on her music sheets with invisible ink.  After the war, she received the croix de guerre and the rosette de la résistance.

Arrival of Josephine Baker in the Hague, Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision,Public Domain Mark.

Baker was a supporter of the Civil Rights Movement and would hold speeches about segregation in the US wherever she went on tour. She would tune her words to address the different ethnic groups she was speaking to express how the US was treating their people in America. She also refused to perform in segregated places in the US.

Unless there is a halt to the waves of lynching, electrocutions without proof, collective aggression and other beauties of the “American way of life”, it means that all the blood spilled in the last war has been in vain. The apparent enemies of Hitler see his triumph multiplied in the Southern United States.

Josephine Baker,1952, Buenos Aires

Her constant criticism of American racism was threatening the international relations of a country trying to project 'individual rights and liberty in America' as well as the benefits of democracy over communism. In the 50s, US embassies in various South American countries made it difficult for her to enter and perform in Latin America if she did not stop her political speeches. But because she had French citizenship, they could not seize her passport and stop her from travelling as they did with other African Americans calling out the country for its discrimination.

Josephine Baker had a vision of change she wanted to see in the world and fought to make that change. As well as using her stage as a platform to raise awareness, she also adopted 12 children all from different nationalities to prove that despite physical differences, children of different backgrounds could love each other as siblings.

As of 30 November 2021, is the first Black woman to enter the Pantheon.

Who was Jelena J. Dimitrijević?

Jelena J. Dimitrijević's first books

A unique woman

An inspiration to others

Read about the life and works of Serbia’s first feminist author

This is a story about a Serbian writer and traveller who chose to lead a very different life to the one expected of a woman born and raised in the patriarchal Serbian society of the 19th and early 20th century.

Brave, educated and self-aware, this remarkable woman was a poet, novelist and a writer of travelogues and she has remained an inspiration to this day.

Jelena J. Dimitrijević (1862-1945) was born in Kruševac, a small town in central Serbia. Born into a wealthy family, Jelena was able to get a good education. However, when she was very young, an eye injury forced her to quit school and the doctors even forbade her from reading or writing.

Disregarding the doctors’ advice, Jelena continued her education at home with private tutors. She never stopped educating herself for her entire life.

Jelena and her husband moved to Niš in 1881.

Niš had just been liberated from the rule of the Ottoman Empire in 1878 and the town was still filled with Oriental flavours and ways of life. Jelena was fascinated with Niš and its residents, especially with Muslim women. She managed to get a privileged look into the lives of Muslim women, went behind harem walls and discover their well-guarded secrets. In 1897, Jelena publishedLetters from Niš about Harems(‘Pisma iz Niša o haremima’), the very first Serbian prose book written and published by a female author.

While still in Niš, Jelena also published her first book of poetry, signing it only with her first name. Immediately, rumours about the identity of the poet started spreading all over Niš, with people claiming she was a runaway Turkish girl.

Wanting to learn more about the life of Muslim women, Jelena later travelled further east and documented her travels and experiences in the travelogueLetters from Thessaloniki(‘Pisma iz Soluna’) as well as in the novelThe New(‘Nove’).

At the beginning of the 20th century, Jelena and her husband moved to Belgrade, the capital of Serbia, where she quickly became a prolific writer and a member of the Serbian Writers’ Society.

Jelena J. Dimitrijević was well educated, talented, self-aware and very bold and, in the 19th century patriarchal Serbian society, this made her quite unique and very different from the majority of women. She was a polyglot and spoke German, French, Greek, Russian, English and, due to her fascination with the Orient, Turkish as well.

Jelena travelled extensively - beforeWorld War I, she visited Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Greece, and from 1919 to 1927, France, Spain, England and America.

Her continued fascination led her to explore not only Egypt, Palestine, Syria and Lebanon but also India, Japan and China. She funded the majority of her many travels herself.

As a feminist, Jelena was proud to have met Mrs Hoda Sha’arawi, the founder of the Egyptian Feminist Union. As a writer, she had an extraordinary opportunity to meet Rabindranath Tagore. Jelena’s travelogues include works such asThe Seven Seas and Three Oceans(‘Sedam mora i tri okeana’),Letters from India(‘Pisma iz Indije’) andLetters from Misir(‘Pisma iz Misira’).

Jelena J. Dimitrijević had been forgotten in Serbian history and literature for a long time. However, in the 1980s, the interest in her life and writings was revived.

She has since been republished, studied and talked about by Serbian students, scholars, feminists and female writers. In the 21st century, the life story of Jelena J. Dimitrijević still continues to inspire. Readers can find many publications by and about her at the National Library of Serbia.

From Hollywood glamour to the Siberian gulag, the life of Lithuanian actor Unė Baye was as dramatic in life as it was on the stage

Uršulė Babickaitė-Graičiūnienėwas born in the Lithuanian village of Laukminiškiai. She began acting and singing whilst in elementary school. In 1913, she moved to Russia, where she studied music, drama and opera at the St. Petersburg Imperial Conservatory.

Dreaming of becoming a film star, Unė travelled to the United States of America in 1919, and there simplified her name to Unė Baye. She made her screen debut in 1922 and appeared in a handful of Paramount films until 1924.

Unfortunately, because of a visual impairment, Unė Baye abandoned her dream of becoming a Hollywood star. Later, she focuses on theatre, appearing on stage in Chicago, Washington, DC and New York.

In 1924 Unė married her cousin Vytautas Andrew Graičiūnas, and, in 1928, moved back to Europe with him. In London, she established the New Russian Theatre, and later the Anglo-American Company Troupe which performed in Paris theatres.

Whilst in Europe, Baye mixed with famous painters, actors, directors, critics and diplomats, such asJohn Gielgud, Dolores Cassinelli andJacques Devalto name only a few.

Unė’s career was put on hold when she fell seriously ill in 1931, and the following years were scarred by a string of unpleasant incidents. She was involved in two car accidents and underwent several surgeries. Whilst recuperating in Italy, Baye contemplated life as a Catholic nun. She joined theThird Order of Saint Francisbut, despite her devotion, never became a fully-fledged nun.

In 1936, Unė Baye joined her husband in Lithuania. She committed herself to helping her homeland and devoted her energy to elevate Lithuanian theatre. Following her motto “Beauty Is My Alpha and Omega”, she began working at theLithuanian Riflemen’s Union Theatre.

By the end of World War II, Unė and her husband had remained in Lithuania as it fell under three foreign occupations. In 1951, during the Soviet occupation of Lithuania, the Graičiūnas’ family was arrested, under the pretext that they were concealing the United States of America flag. The Soviet authorities sentenced Baye and her husband to five and ten years respectively; both were deported to gulags in Siberia.

After almost two years in exile, Unė Baye returned to Lithuania, having received amnesty from Nikita Khrushchev, the new leader of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Sadly, she returned alone because her husband had died in exile. Unė died in 1961. She is remembered today for her contributions to theatre and stagecraft in Lithuania and beyond.

Anyone who wanted to see the musical avant-garde at work around 1600 went south of the Alps. With figureheads such as Monteverdi, Peri and Caccini and their work in the new opera genre, Italy pioneered an innovative repertoire and ‘modern’ styles and became the mecca for musicians in the early days of the baroque era.



As the capital and seat of the papal residence,Romeoccupied a special place within that vibrant music scene. For while opera dominated in other large cities like Florence, Naples and Venice, in Rome - where the pope had closed the only public theatre after 4 seasons - oratorios, cantatas, chamber music and orchestral genres prevailed.

A consequence of this lack of a public concert circuit was that any musician aiming at establishing a stable career was dependent upon the private music circuit fostered by clergy and nobility. They provided for the income of composers and musicians, by hiring them or by giving assignments. Those sufficiently well-off could enjoy the best performers and the latest music within the walls of his or her own city palace.

Christina of Sweden, Abraham Wuchters, Skoklosters slott. Public Domain

Between 1670 and 1730, one of the most important musical benefactors in Rome was a lady considered one of the most learned women of her time:Christina of Sweden (1626-1689).

The daughter ofKing Gustav of Sweden, Christina was educated both in the arts and the sciences. She had a keen interest in literature, physics, religion, alchemy, music and art and built an important art collection in an attempt to make Stockholm "the Athens of the North". She received eminent foreign writers, musicians, and scholars at her court – among whichRené Descartes, her philosophy teacher.
Her intelligence, knowledge and witty nature gained her the nickname ‘Minerva’.

Christina succeeded her father on the Swedish throne, to take care of posterity, but she struggled with the expectations that were made of women. She detested the idea of having to marry, and was uncomfortable with the sort of things "women were supposed to talk about". Christina was not your average princess, dressing up in lace gowns and tiaras, but somewhat of a tomboy,wearing men's clothesand shoes.

In 1654, after ten years of reign, she secretly converted to Catholicism and renounced the throne – an act that shocked and confused the Christian world. She migrated to Rome, where she was welcomed with open arms by PopeAlexander VII. Christina was now in the heart of the baroque art scene that so passionately thrilled her.

Shortly after her arrival she founded theAccademia dell'Arcadia: a series of meetings for leading artists and intelligentsia of the city, with the aim to revive the classicist ideals of antiquity. TheTor di Nona, Rome’s first public opera house, was opened at her instigation.

She surrounded herself with the best musicians of the city, such asAlessandro Scarlatti(her choirmaster) andArcangelo Corelli(her orchestra conductor).

No longer a Queen of Sweden, she had now taken up the reign as Queen of Arts.

This post began with an idea to write about great female characters in European literature. Those that break the mould. Doing a little bit of research, the term ‘anti-heroine’ came up. And so did a range of characters who could fall into that category (see below for more on them).

So I started to look at what the term ‘anti-heroine’ meant and it started to worry me.



Technically, it’s simple - an anti-heroine is the opposite of a heroine.

According to both theOxford English DictionaryandWikipedia, it means ‘lacking’ traditional heroic qualities - things like bravery, strength and morality.

An anti-heroine is a female protagonist who is not confined by the expectations put upon them, someone who makes ‘unconventional life choices’. The trouble is, conventions and expectations have always had an awful lot to do with gender. So what I came to understand was that being an anti-heroine meant rocking the boat, no longer being feminine, becoming ‘other’.These days, our definition of what it means to be feminine is much broader than that which constrained the authors of the characters outlined below.

So categorising these characters as anti-heroines now starts to feel problematic. They all break the feminine mould of their time - whether or not they possess beauty, none of them will tow the line, they follow their own desires, they stand up for themselves.

It is exactly this anti-heroic ‘bad behaviour’, and determination to ‘defy conventional ethical codes’ that makes them real and relatable.

To characterise them as 'anti-heroic' and therefore ‘lacking’, seems wrong. They are strong, independent, courageous, passionate, tempestuous, intelligent, angry, sometimes even evil. And they show us that even when a life is constrained by behavioural codes relating to patriarchy, marriage and motherhood, that it is ok to want more than that, to find a way to get more than that. They tell us that 
what a woman wants for herself matters more than what society expects of her.

That shows great bravery, strength and morality, doesn’t it? It makes them not 'anti-heroic' but bonafide 'heroic'.

However you want to categorise them, here are five box-breakers from great European literature:

When I finally got round to reading this, it made me both smile and laugh.

Where were you all my life, Jane? Despite being from the fusty old Victorian era, Jane was a breath of fresh air to me. Jane is orphaned early on, (solid way to start a story - see nearly every Disney movie), but she is not blessed with the other heroic Disney trope of beauty. Nor is she given to going along with things that she does not agree with. So, ugly and disagreeable, she must instead have a personality. And it’s a great one. Go and read it.

Icare for myself. The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself.

I read this, aged 20, with no empathy for Emma at all. It was her own behaviour and bad decision-making that brought about her ever-increasing sorrow and ultimate tragic ending.

But I was naive. Because what else could she do? A girl with big ambition trapped within a stiflingly domestic and pedestrian existence. These days, she’d be running a blog with a lot of swearing in it about what a terrible parent she was whilst swiping right on an anonymous profile on Tinder.

But in mid-19th century France, married to an unobservant and unexciting local doctor, she had to get her kicks from reading romantic novels and failing at a series of adulterous affairs.

She wanted to die, but she also wanted to live in Paris.

The epitome of the cliché that behind every great man, there’s a great woman. If by great, you mean cunning and murderous. When he’s doubting his ability to kill King Duncan, she’s right there behind him, handing him the knife and pushing him out the door. Strong, ambitious, well-organised. Hygienic. And ultimately driven to madness by guilt.

I’m not sure whether this one is an anti-heroine or a plain old villain. Either way, she’s impressive.

Macbeth: If we should fail?

Lady Macbeth: We fail?
But screw your courage to the sticking place,
And we'll not fail.

A beautiful and intoxicating woman in high society, the subject of several people’s infatuations, she succumbs eventually to an affair, falls madly in love and realises that her marriage offers little joy. Forthright, independent and determined, she runs away from her husband to be with her lover. Unfortunately, it doesn’t end well.

All the girls in the world were divided into two classes: one class included all the girls in the world except her, and they had all the usual human feelings and were very ordinary girls; while the other class - herself alone - had no weaknesses and was superior to all humanity.

Back to the Brontë sisters, whose characters personify the often bleak and unforgiving Yorkshire moors that they inhabit. This is one of those 19th century stories in which a benevolent parent adopts an unruly homeless child, replacing peaceful domestic order with chaos.

Here, Heathcliff is the stray child, and Catherine the headstrong daughter of the house who falls for him but marries someone else of better social standing. In a storyline twist, Heathcliff becomes suddenly wealthy, but Catherine remains a faithful wife and then dies tragically young (aged 18) so they never manage to get together. At least not in life. She comes back to haunt Heathcliff and he dies in her old bedroom before being buried next to her.

‘Heathcliff, it’s me, it’s Cathy, I’ve come ho-o-me.’

Oh, ok then…

Why shouldn’t you suffer? I do! Will you forget me? Will you be happy when I am in the earth? Will you say twenty years hence, ‘That’s the grave of Catherine Earnshaw. I loved her long ago, and was wretched to lose her; but it is past. I’ve loved many others since: my children are dearer to me than she was; and at death, I shall not rejoice that I am going to her; I shall be sorry that I must leave them! Will you say so, Heathcliff?

Polish painter who lived in Munich and Paris

Olga Boznańska(1865-1940) was born in Kraków, Poland and later active in Munich and Paris.

Her father, Adam Nowina-Boznański, came from a noble Polish family which cherished traditional values but, in the spirit of 19th-century positivism, he became a train engineer rather than a landowner. Her mother, Eugénie Mondan, came from Valence and was a teacher in the convent school ofPremonstratensiansin Imbramowice near Kraków.

Olga first received drawing lessons from her mother. Her teachers in Kraków includedKazimierz Pochwalski, an academic portrait painter at the Viennese court, and the more realist-inclinedAntoni Piotrowski, draughtsman-correspondent of theSerbo-Bulgarian war.

In 1884-85 Boznańska attended Adrian Baraniecki's Higher Courses for Women at the Technical and Industrial Museum in Kraków, before she travelled to Munich to continue her artistic education, in the studios of Carl Kricheldorf and Wilhelma Dürr (The Munich Academy did not admit women at that time).

In Munich, Olga found herself in the middle of a great artistic capital still enjoying the patronage of Ludwig II of Bavaria.

She had close contacts both with the established Polish Munich school (especiallyJózef BrandtandAlfred Wierusz-Kowalski) as well as young Polish and German artists likeWacław Szymanowski,Samuel Hirszenberg, Hedwig Weiss and many others). Brandt was her mentor and he introduced her to the workings of the art world, from which she would soon profit.

Olga quickly realised the importance of appearing in international exhibitions to which she would later send many works. More importantly, Munich formed her as an artist and made her realise that, if she was to succeed, she had to devote herself entirely to art and find her own artistic idiom.

Although she had been exhibiting since 1886, it was not until she painted her portrait of Paul Nauen in 1893 that she received real recognition.

The following year, it brought her a gold medal at the International Exhibition in Vienna. Boznańska was under the influence of German realism although her paintings from that period show an interest in Impressionist technique and slightly less obvious symbolism.

In the Orangery(In the Greenhouse)is one of the most important works from Boznańska's Munich period when she often portrayed her friends and other young people.

The introduction of adolescence as the main subject of her art was closely linked with the rise of the Symbolism movement in poetry. Boznańska's painting refers unequivocally to one of the most talked about collections of poems from that time,Maurice Materlinck'sLes serres chaudes.

In the Orangerycan be interpreted as the symbol of a protective and at the same time oppressive system of upbringing. Boznańska was experimenting with merging the academic precepts she received from her teachers with Impressionist effects.

In Munich, she started working as a teacher, and in 1895, she replaced Theodor Hummel in his private school. The next year, she was offered a position of professor at the Art Academy in Kraków which she rejected. She was already a recognised artist and no longer an aspiring art student.

The Berlin magazineBazarnominated her as one of the twelve best European women artists. Having visited Paris and kept in touch with her French family, she decided to settle there permanently in 1898.

She was also very much interested in the Old Masters. The Alte Pinakothek Museum was one of her favourite places in Munich, and Diego Velázquez was her favourite painter, whose technique she tried to absorb.Portrait of a Boy in His Gymnasium Uniform(seen above) shows this influence as well as that ofWhistler, who at that time was an elected member of the Munich Academy.

Boznańska's aesthetic was influenced by artistic ideas current around 1900 and espoused by Whistler in his famous 'Ten O'Clock' lecture. Colour and form were the key elements painters could use to create artworks analogous to musical compositions. The influence of Whistler andJaponismcan clearly be seen in Olga'sJapanese Girlfrom 1889.

Boznańska was acquiring a following as a gifted portrait painter with a personal and inimitable style.

Her portraits were compared to old frescoes or antique tapestries. Her exceptional ability to create psychological likenesses of her models as well as a firm resolve not to flatter the sitter won her recognition in Paris. Two of her portraits were purchased by the French state, which was exceptional.

Art historian Jan Cavanaugh has highlighted Boznańska's subtle colourism and sensitivity to expression, and wrote the following aboutPortrait of Anna Sariusz-Zaleska:

'Though the grey of the landscape painter's eyes almost blends with the pale flesh tone of the face, her gaze is intense and penetrating. The concentration of psychic force in her face is emphasized further by the isolation of the head against the dark background…'

Jan Cavanaugh, 'Out Looking' inEarly Modern Polish Art, 1890-1918, University of California Press, 2000

Boznańska's uncompromising attitude towards sitters sometimes put her in trouble with her clients, unhappy about the prolonged sessions (she always took her time when it came to painting), but it also won her the admiration of connoisseurs, intellectuals and other artists.

Boznańska painted many insightful portraits of the European intelligentsia from the beginning of the 20th century. Among her models were: Henryk Sienkiewicz, Émile Verhaeren, Artur Rubinstein to name a few.

Indifferent to new trends in art, Olga withdrew more and more into her studio. It became one of the places to visit in Paris for Poles and Americans, who often became her students. Boznańska was one of key figures in Polish artistic circles in Paris during the 1920s and 1930s.

Her art found official recognition just before her death – in 1937 Boznańska was awarded the Grand Prix at theExposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderneand, in 1938, she enjoyed success at the Venice Biennale.

Lizzie Magie's great idea

How Charles Darrow came upon it

Covering up the truth

And uncovering it again

Europeans just love Monopoly

And so did the British Secret Service

'Hepeating' might be a new word, but the concept it represents is tried and tested. Woman comes up with great idea. Man takes it and passes it off as his own. Man receives great acclaim. Woman doesn’t make a fuss. Add in a dinner party ending in a broken friendship, a courtroom revelation, and escaping prisoners of war, and you have the story of one of the world’s most popular board games, Monopoly.

The story begins in 1903 in the United States. Elizabeth Magie came up with a board game called ‘The Landlord’s Game’.

She wanted to use it as an educational tool to teach people about thesingle tax theory of Henry George. He thought that land and natural resources belonged to the people, and they should rent it but never own it. And that governments should only charge tax on land, not on improvements, labour or profits. In the instructions that came with the game, Magie wrote:

Let the children once see clearly the gross injustice of our present land system and when they grow up, if they are allowed to develop naturally, the evil will soon be remedied.

source

The Landlord’s Game had a board around which were various different properties, their purchase price and rental value. There were also utilities, and chance cards. Sound familiar?

She took out a patent in 1904 and self-published it in 1906. In 1909, she approached manufacturer’s Parker Brothers, who rejected the game on the grounds that it was too complicated.

In 1932, a man called Charles Darrow went to dinner at the home of his friend, Charles Todd. After dinner, they played a few rounds of The Landlord’s Game, in which Darrow took a great deal of interest.

Not long after, Darrow took an idea to Parker Brothers and in 1935, they published the game Monopoly, complete, it is thought, with a spelling mistake copied directly from The Landlord’s Game.

The Todds and the Darrows fell out and never spoke to each other again. Players of after-dinner board games, take note!

Parker Brothers bought The Landlord’s Game from Lizzie Magie for the sum of $500 in 1936 in a deal that included zero royalties, ever. She refused to have any changes made to it, but made no demands to promote it, and no objections to the manufacturing of Monopoly.

A 1936 newspaper article reported that she said it was ‘all right with her if she never made a dime so long as the Henry George single tax idea was spread to the people of the country.’

In asworn testimonymany years later, Parker Brothers’ president described how he saw the little old grayhaired Quaker woman as ‘a rabid Henry George single tax advocate, a real evangelist’.

That same 1936 newspaper article recognised Magie’s The Landlord’s Game as the source of the game Monopoly. But determined to deny it, Parker Brothers included information in every box of Monopoly crediting Darrow as its creator. It would be 40 years until the truth was widely known.

25 years after Magie died, another game designer, Ralph Anspach, was in a legal battle with Parker Brothers over his ‘Anti-Monopoly’ game. Parker Brothers claimed he was violating their copyright. Anspach, during his research to support his own case, turned up Magie’s patents and used them in court.

Today, Monopoly is in the top five most popular board games worldwide - up there with chess, Scrabble, checkers and backgammon. Monopoly is licensed in 103 countries and printed in 37 languages.

There are versions covering 32 European countries, with many having bespoke localised editions. There are almost 100 versions for different towns, cities and regions of the United Kingdom. There’s even one for the fictional setting of TV soap opera, Coronation Street. France is gamified in nearly 50 editions and Germany in 35.

Adversity makes people creative. And while some resorted to making their own cardboard versions of Monopoloy in World War II, a very special edition was being created in the UK.

In 1941, the British Secret Intelligence Service asked the game’s UK manufacturer - John Waddington Ltd - for help with a bold plan. Fake charities distributed a new version of Monopoly via the Red Cross to prisoners of war held by Nazis. Unlike the usual sets, these boxes included genuine maps, compasses, real money and a file to help the prisoners to escape, apparently with a good deal of success!

So, while Lizzie Magie's The Landlord's Game might not have saved the economy, it did end up, in a round about kind of way, saving lives. Well done, Lizzie!

A Woman of Letters and a Philosopher

Towards an Enlightened Republic

A European Salon

Writer, republican, literary theoretician and philosopher,Madame de Staëlcontributed to the diffusion of ideas in Europe through her travels and herSalon, where she received many European intellectuals.

Anne-Louise Germaine Necker was born into theSwiss bourgeoisiein 1766 and received an education steeped in the spirit of the Enlightenment. From her childhood, she rubbed shoulders with politicians, talked with theEncyclopaedistsand developed an enthusiasm forRousseau's ideas.

After her marriage toBaron Staël von Holstein, Germaine de Staël opened aSalonwhere new ideas, brought by participants in the American Revolutionary War, could circulate.

She developed a passion for writing at an early age and some of her first compositions survive in 'La Correspondance littéraire'. Published in 1788, Madame de Staël's 'Lettres sur le caractère et les ouvrages de Jean-Jacques Rousseau' marked her first literary success.

At the start of the French Revolution, Germaine de Staël was in favour of what she felt was progress and a step towards a constitutional monarchy. But after the fall of the monarchy, she left France and took refuge atCoppetin Switzerland and later in England. During this period she wrote many novels,playsandessays.

After her return to Paris in May 1795, Madame de Staël reopened her Salon and spoke in favour of a moderate and rational Republic with roots in the Enlightenment. In 1800, she presented a new view of literature in 'De la littérature considérée dans ses rapports avec les institutions sociales'.

Between 1795 and 1802, Germaine de Staël watched the rise ofNapoleon Bonaparte. Once she realised he wouldn’t promote the ideals of the Revolution, she fought him on the ideological level. Napoleon exiled her after she wrote 'Delphine' (1802). Unable to publish, she travelled throughout Europe and received many people who were opposed to Napoleon at Coppet, including:

Coppet was a new sort of gathering place, in transition from the Salons of the Enlightenment to theCénacleof the Romantic movement. It was a place to exchange opinions and ideas, and drew intellectuals across three generations, of different nationalities, religious views and political opinions. United by the values of liberty, the individual and his rights, respect for others, and equality before the law, they all spread their ideas through their writings and their travels across Europe.

'Corinne, ou l'Italie', written during Germaine de Staël's exile, shows her ideas on aesthetics, the arts and literature. 'De l'Allemagne' was an important essay in developing the Romantic doctrine, and waspublished clandestinely in London in 1813, after its censure in 1810.

Germaine de Staël returned to France after the fall of Napoleon and was at the pinnacle of her glory during the First Restoration (1814-1815). She died in Paris on 14 July 1817, the anniversary of the storming of the Bastille prison and the beginning of the French Revolution.

The Dutch reform dress movement

This painting from 1900 by Dutch artist Jan Toorop employs a 'modern', pointillist technique to depict a genuinely modern woman: Marie Jeanette de Lange.

Marie Jeanette was born in Jakarta in 1865, where her father worked as an engineer. Aged 22, she moved with her first husband to the Netherlands and connected with the Amsterdam art scene, where she associated with photographer George Hendrik Breitner and painter Isaac Israels among others.

She later relocated to The Hague, where Jan Toorop painted her against the background of her house in the Van Stolkpark.

At the time of this portrait, Marie Jeanette was involved in the Reform Movement which campaigned for loose-fitting and healthy clothes for women.

The movement, rooted in the protest actions of the ‘bloomers’ in mid-19th century America, was not only supported by social reformers and feminists, but also by doctors and hygienists.

Their prime concern was the medical danger of thecorset, which prohibited freedom of movement and respiration because of the narrow laces tied around the back, and because of the heavy weight of the crinoline it carried.

As industrial production of loose-fitting wear was still in its infancy, reform clothes were often home-made.

The outfit Marie Jeanette is wearing in the painting is probably a bespoke, handmade (and maybe self-made) creation, combining a peachy pink, softly flowing dress with a bolero vest. As with most reform clothing, the design of the dress is very simple and the fabric as well as the trimming are undecorated.

InThe Netherlands, the case for the reform dress was ardently pursued by theVereeniging voor Verbetering van Vrouwenkleeding('Association for the improvement of women’s clothing').

The reform dress movement led to Marie Jeanette meeting Toorop, probably during the preparations of an exhibition about women's labour that took place in The Hague in 1898, for which Toorop designed the promotional posters and catalogue.

Founded in 1899 as a direct outcome of this exhibition, Marie Jeanette was its first president and host: most of the association’s meetings took place at her home). The association organised member meetings and publisheda monthly magazine, boasting patterns to enable women to craft their own clothes.

Its membership grew rapidly - from 650 members in the first year to 2,000 four years later. Though the association was active from 1899 until 1926, Marie Jeanette was no longer president by 1902.

Yet despite their efforts to make 'clothes in which we can walk, sit and work; that we can put on and take off without any help; that allow us to keep our tissues, our purse, our keys close; that don’t swipe the floor', reform dresses would were not fashionable for long as women met a lot of disapproval for their less than flattering 'bags'.

Furthermore, despite the dress style having originated in a desire to wear more 'modest' clothes in a less sexualized silhouette, the reform dress was found to be offensive by many critics, as the flowing fabric occasionally allowed for a thigh or chest to be seen.

Marie-Jeanette's legacy lives on today, not only in Toorop's portrait, but also in the variety of female fashions that flourished following her and the association's pioneering activities.

Goddesses

Royal women

Female icons

Carving a place for female statues

Tell us about your area

How many statues near you represent women?

If you were to count the statues in your local town, village or city, how many would you find that represent women?

Despite women making up more than half of the population of Europe, most of the statues you come across commemorate the lives of men.



Many statues of women that do exist tend to depict women as a concept - used for aesthetic or allegorical purposes - rather than specific female historical figures or their achievements.



Cubist Girl (Kubistisk flicka), Jssfrk. Wikimedia Commons Community - Public Domain

The world of religion has always given us female statues - just think of Greek and Roman goddesses like Aphrodite, Venus and Minerva. And many Christian statues exist of female saints and, in particular, Mary, mother of Jesus.

But even though you maybe need to look a bit harder to find statuesque examples of real, named and notable women, there are some wonderful examples.

In many countries, royal women are popular. For example, it's estimated thatnearly half of the statutes depicting women in the UK are of Queen Victoria, as well as other queens likeQueen Louise,Catherine the Great,Empress Josephineand more.

In France, many statues depict Joan of Arc, such as these examples from Paris,Saint EtienneandOrleans_._

In Amsterdam, you can find statues of a queen (Wilhelmina), a diarist (Anne Frank) and a singer (Tante Leen).



Further afield, we find actors such asWenche Foss in Oslo, poets and writers likeAgnieszka Osiecka in Warsawand nurses such asEdith Cavell in Londondepicted on statues.

But overall, women are still in the minority on statues. Now, some organisations and projects like ArtUK aredocumenting how many statues commemorate womenand those likeInvisible WomenandErect More Womenare trying to make a change by campaigning for more statues commemorating women's achievements.

Feminine willpower through fashion

Elsa Schiaparelliis one of the most renowned personalities in fashion history. Not only because she was one of the most striking designers of 1930s Paris, but also because she was a woman who always fought for her plans to become reality, and for her voice to be heard directly through her stunning and unforgettable creations.

Schiaparelli was born on September 10, 1890, in Rome, Italy, in an aristocratic family. While in Rome, she studied philosophy at university, and then moved to London, where she later married Count William de Wendt de Kerlor. The coupled lived in New York for a while, where Elsa encountered the fashion world by working a boutique selling French fashion.

After the break-up of her marriage, she moved to Paris, where she decided to set up her own clothing brand in 1927.

Schiaparelli's debut collection featured a series ofsweaters with big bows in trompe-l’oeil motif. An editor fromFrench Voguesaw them and immediately decided to feature the designs on the magazine. After knitwear, she produced bathing suits and ski-wear, also including some avant-garde designs, as the so-called "divided skirt”, a sort of pleated shorts - one of the first time something like this was proposed for women.

Schiaparelli is today most remembered for evening-wear, which she added to her collection in 1931.

In her witty creations, humour and fantasy came together in sophisticated and very conceptual kind of couture. Schiaparelli decided to include in her most precious creations intellectual references that could turn the clothes in something else, applying the artistic methods used by the Surrealists. Schiaparelli was in fact a close friend of artists as Jean Cocteau and Salvador Dalì, with whom she used to collaborate for her creations, having them design textiles and suggesting ideas for the construction of the clothes.

Schiaparelli was pioneering, challenging the limits of traditional couture. She pushed the boundaries of acceptable couture standards, and played with the accepted definitions of 'high' and low' fashion.

For instance, her designs made use of visible zips in couture, something that had previously been confined to underwear or cheaper productions.

Schiaparelli discontinued her couture business in 1951 and closed her design house 1954 due to heavy debts, but continued her work in design producingaccessoriesand wigs.

Her 1954 autobiography Shocking Life was the coronation of the activity that she loved: 'make clothes.’ Here, her life is told like a sort of fairytale, in which the characters seem to be lost at times, and finally find themselves again during the journey and thanks to fashion.

A direct line can be drawn between Schiaparelli’s life, creations and even her writing style. She’s  playful and carefree - from moments in which he speaks of collaborations with great artists to the descriptions of her husband leaving her for the dancer Isadora Duncan.

Elsa Schiaparelli's life was, in itself, a sort of surrealist “ready-made”: something transported in a context different from its own in order to become an artistic creation. A ready-made made by fate, in which Elsa Schiaparelli, a bourgeois Roman destined for a cultured and idle life, decide instead to “make clothes” and become famous for it, following her tenacious soul.

Teaching and living abroad

Lithuanian Linguistics

Designing the dictionary

Language by design

Many people, while living away from home, feel that they slowly get less proficient in their mother tongue. Not so for linguistJonas Jablonskis (1860-1930), who was the first to formulate and outline the basic principles of the Lithuanian language, while spending a significant part of his academic career and life in emigration.

After graduating from Marijampolė Gymnasium, Jablonskis first move was to Moscow. There, he studied History and Philology (the study of the structure, history and development of languages) at the University of Moscow from 1881 to 1885.

In his native Lithuania, Jablonskis, as a Catholic, was not unable to find employment as a teacher so instead worked in a number of other nations in the region over the course of the following 30 years. In 1889, he found a role as a teacher in Latvia, and later in Estonia, Belarus and, during World War 1, he taught at a Lithuanian refugees' school in Voronezh, Russia.

Eventually he returned to Vilnius. When the University of Lithuania in Kaunas opened in 1922, he was elected an honorary professor and taught there until 1926.

During his time away from Lithuania, Jablonskis continued his linguistic studies in the Lithuanian language. During all this time, his most notable achievement was contributing to the formation of standard Lithuanian.

While teaching in Latvia, in the summer breaks, Jablonskis returned to Lithuania to collected data for linguistic studies among native speakers. In 1901, the Russian Academy of Sciences charged Jablonskis with editing a Lithuanian dictionary which had been compiled by Antanas Juška. This charge caused him to be dismissed from his teaching position at the time. In spite of this, he continued his efforts, beginning to work on his Lithuanian Grammar (1901) under the name of Petras Kriaušaitis.

Jablonskis chose to base the language on the western High-Lithuanian dialect, a language being spoken at the time. He eschewed earlier attempts to establish a standard Lithuanian language which were based upon the dialect of Prussian Lithuanians. In doing so, Jablonskis went against the style of contemporary literary language, which was heavily influenced by foreign elements.

From then onward, written Lithuanian would be more authentically Lithuanian than it had ever been.

Jablonskis dedicated his life to the language: defining how words are spelled, substituting loan words from other languages with Lithuanian alternatives, developing rules for how new words should be formed and bringing consistency to syntax and grammar. He also introduced the letter ū into Lithuanian writing.

Jablonskis collected his linguistic findings in an academic text, which is still in use. And still, today, the Lithuanian language evolves, grows and expands owing to the accomplishments of this legendary thinker.

Who was Camille Flammarion?

What books did Camille Flammarion write?

Is there life on Mars?

Founding the Astronomical Society of France

Who was French astronomer and author Camille Flammarion?

Beginning his career by claiming that there is life on other planets, Camille Flammarion had by the end of the 19th century become one of the most famous astronomers on the planet! Passionate about astronomy, he contributed to making this field accessible to all.

Nicolas Camille Flammarion (1842-1925) came to Paris in 1856 as an apprentice engraver and took evening classes, particularly at the Association polytechnique. He then joined theParis Observatory's calculation centre as a 'student astronomer'.

But in 1862, his first book,La Pluralité des mondes habités('The Plurality of Inhabited Worlds'), caused a scandal.

In this book, Flammarion supports the theory that other planets might be inhabited. Through previous centuries, this theory had such prestigious defenders as Johannes Kepler, Galileo and Descartes! Flammarion left the Observatory immediately after, but his career in popular science had been launched.

His books were very successful:Astronomie populaire('Popular Astronomy'), published in 1880, received an award from the Académie Française and had sold 100,000 copies by 1900.

Flammarion published his books with major publishing houses like Hachette and Hetzel, and of course with Marpon and Flammarion, founded by his brother Ernest.

Starting in 1865, he also taught classes and spoke at conferences, not only on astronomy but also on other subjects such as aeronautics.

His activities took him beyond Paris: as early as 1868 he spoke at conferences inBelgiumand also inItaly. In 1875, he travelled all acrossFranceon a 'grand tour', speaking in Burgundy, Auvergne, Brittany and Normandy.

Above all subjects, the planet Mars most fascinated Flammarion.

In 1876, he drew a map of the planet, taking into account his observations and those of all his predecessors since the 17th century. At the same time, the Italian astronomerGiovanni Schiaparelliclaimed to have observed a network of canals on the surface of Mars.

In the controversy over these Martian canals, Flammarion chose to defend their existence. These canals confirmed his theory that life was possible on Mars, even though he admitted that he had never observed them himself. In 1892, he published a book devoted entirely to Mars: [La Planète Mars et ses conditions d'habitabilité].

Astronomy is also very present in Flammarion's science fiction novels,UraniaandStella, but his interest went beyond books.

He wished to set up a private observatory in Paris! So he installed a dome and a refracting telescope on a property in Juvisy-sur-Orge that had been given to him in 1882 by Louis-Eugène Méret, an admirer and amateur astronomer. On 28 January 1887, he founded theSociété astronomique de France(Astronomical Society of France) and became its president.

After the astronomer's death on 3 June 1925 in Juvisy, his peers named Asteroid 1021, discovered on 11 March 1924, Flammario in his honour!

Who invented bread and pancakes?

So what about the palaeo diet?

What archaeology tells us about eating and drinking in the past

Archaeology can give great insight into what processes have made us the humans we are today. Seemingly small things have hugely influenced our contemporary lives, and maybe the most important one is the invention of cooking. Richard Wrangham, professor of biological anthropology, in his book,Catching Fire: How Cooking Made Us Human, describes how cooking reduced the caloric cost of digestion and increased the efficiency of food consumption. According to Wrangham, homo erectus (who lived between about 1.89 million and 143,000 years ago), evolved to develop a smaller, more efficient digestive tract that freed up the energy to enable brain growth.[1] This was thanks to Homo Erectus being able to cook their food, setting the stage for modern humans. But what, and how, did these palaeolithic humans cook?

Amaia Arranz Otaegui, a postdoctoral researcher from University of Copenhagen and her colleagues have found archaeobotanical evidence revealing the origins of bread 14,400 years ago in north-eastern Jordan. That's about 4,000 years before agriculture![2] "Our work shows that bread was not a product of settled, complex societies but of Paleolithic hunter-gatherer society," said Otaegui for The Washington Post. One of Otaegui’s articles poses that “Interdisciplinary analysis indicates the use of some of the “founder crops” of southwest Asian agriculture (like wild einkorn) and root foods (e.g. club-rush tubers) to produce flat bread-like products.”

The first known flatbread comes from Shubayqa 1, a Natufian hunter-gatherer site. Through cultural diffusion, and over time, these first flatbreads have evolved into the pizzas, pita, puri, pane carasau, chapati and tortillas we know and love today.

How humans have evolved to eat meat is another area of discussion and debate among archaeologists. Humans might have resorted to meat eating as a necessary adaptation to their changing environment, but it might also have been a milestone change that allowed for quick development of the human brain. Katherine Milton of the University of California says that “early humans were forced into this dietary change because the forests of Africa were receding and these hominids simply couldn't get enough plant matter to stay alive”.[3] Meredith F. Small from Cornell University adds that “for these few million years, humans apparently stuffed themselves with raw meat. And then somewhere, somehow, somebody offered it up cooked.”[4]

The palaeo diet is a diet based on the idea that your body benefits most from the same foods that palaeolithic humans ate. It, among others, cuts starchy vegetables, cereal grains, and legumes in favour of unprocessed meat, nuts and seeds, and a lot of fruits and veggies.[5] But archaeological research shows that maybe flatbreads and other grain products might have been a bigger part of the palaeolithic diet after all, and that meat might have played a smaller role than first thought in our ancestors’ daily meals. Ann Gibbons at National Geographic mentions the high level of plant-based food in hunter-gatherers societies: “It’s true that hunter-gatherers around the world crave meat more than any other food and usually get around 30 percent of their annual calories from animals. But most also endure lean times when they eat less than a handful of meat each week.”[6]

The palaeo diet might not be so palaeo after all, as archaeological research keeps unearthing new evidence and formulating new hypotheses about the evolution of our species. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the palaeo diet isn’t healthy, but it does show interesting insights into the constantly changing landscape of archaeology.

On 1 February 1953, the Netherlands was hit by a big natural disaster, the North Sea flood ('Watersnoodramp'). In the early morning, the dykes broke through due to a heavy storm and high tide and water flooded large parts of the South-West provinces. Over 1800 people died and many were forced to leave their houses and seek refuge elsewhere.

This blog highlights several videos in relation to the disaster, the migration of people, aid actions and the reconstruction.

The Dutch have a centuries-long tumultuous relationship with water. 20% of the country is belowsea leveland 50% is less than one meter above it. Floods have been depicted in images for hundreds of years, for instance inthis lithography, by Jan Kuypers, which shows relief actions and shelter provided to the victims after a flood in 1876.

The storm surge in 1953 however also marks the first time that video footage captured the aftermath of the flood.

These moving images of the 'Watersnoodramp' reached people days after the flood, as televisions sets were not yet common in Dutch households and newsreels were only shown in cinemas. Radio broadcasts, press photography and illustrations were the fastest medium at the time.

Reporters were often quicker at the scene than aid workers.

In total, 72,000 people were evacuated for a longer period of time. The majority of people eventually returned to their homes, but large groups migrated to other places inthe Netherlandsto start new lives.

Farmers were expecially hit hard as their land had become infertile after the flood. At least 34 Zealand farmers had to start over in the Noordoostpolder, an area in the Flevoland province. This video shows the farmers officially giving up their land and singing a lease for their new farms.

The Dutch tried to help their fellow countryman by donating to the National Relief Fund. There were also international actions, like the one held by Dutch illustrator Eppo Doeve.

People were encouraged to buy a 'Doeve-postcard' for 10 cents with the Latin text 'Luctor Et Emergo' (I struggle and emerge), which is the motto of the Zealand province. The card shows an image of the disaster and includes a text in Spanish, English, French and German on the back to thank people and reassure businesses relations about the resilience of the Dutch industry. Over 100,000 postcards were sent.

In addition, a local action called 'Operatie snert' (Operation pea soup) was organised.

Soldiers of the Prince Hendrik Barracks in Nijmegen made 30,000 litres of pea soup and sold it in the streets and at people's houses. In this video, the director of the National Relief Fund sells the first bowls of soup. The contributions added tens of thousands of Dutch guilders to the fund.

A disaster of this magnitude should not happen again and therefore the government accepted the ambitiousDelta Planin 1957, one of the most revolutionary hydraulic engineering projects in the world, as shown in the video 'Six years after the storm tide'.

One of the most important tasks was to shorten the coastline by 700 kilometres, the motto being 'The shorter the coast, the easier the defence'.

To this day, the Dutch continue to defend their country from the water, anticipating short and long term solutions with the Delta Programme. With current climate change and the rise of the sea level, this is a matter of urgency, not just on a national but also a global level.

Finally, the relationship between the Dutch and the North Sea has also been an inspiration for music artists. The Irish DJ duo Lakker produced an album solely sampling field recordings, TV and radio broadcasts from the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision.

To gain insight into the topic, Lakker went on a trip around the Netherlands to meet professors and researchers who could explain to them different aspect of this theme. Their journey is captured in this documentary.

His secret mission informed world leaders about Nazi atrocities in occupied Poland

In spring, the last week of April in 1987, Jan Karski, a then 73-year-old professor of comparative government and theory of communism, entered, as he did regularly for more than 30 years, the lecture hall at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service in Washington D.C.

The room was packed. Karski’s courses in Middle European studied were always over-subscribed. Students loved him for his work as a professor, but also for his 'presence and grace', an air of Polish aristocratic gallantry that made him stand out when he walked across the campus.

The Washington Post’s Sarah Booth Conroy described him as follows: 'His speech has a charming, lilting accent, as well as grace and eloquence. He's very thin, a body of bones and nerves'.

He was no stranger to affection or even admiration. But this time things were different - he got a standing ovation. Everyone cheered and clapped. Karski was surprised and moved.

Probably no less so than his students, when they saw their beloved professor on PBS earlier that week.

Karski was one of the key witnesses interviewed in the eagerly anticipatedShoah, a 9.5 hour long, seminal Holocaust documentary by Claude Lanzmann. Three decades later, it is widely considered a cinematic masterpiece and a milestone in Holocaust studies. Karski’s testimony, shot in 1978, accounts for 40 minutes of the film.

During World War II, Karski was a lieutenant of the Polish Underground State, tasked with special courier missions, carrying dispatches to France and Britain.

But his true life mission - which marked his life forever - came in the autumn of 1942. Karski was selected to undertake a secret mission to contact world leaders, and inform them of Nazi atrocities in occupied Poland. In order to gather evidence, Karski with the help of Jewish activists, entered twice the Warsaw Ghetto.

He recounted inShoah:

My job was just to walk. And observe. And remember. The odour. The children. Dirty. Lying. I saw a man standing with blank eyes. I asked the guide: what is he doing? The guide whispered: 'He’s just dying'. I remember degradation, starvation and dead bodies lying on the street. We were walking the streets and my guide kept repeating: 'Look at it, remember, remember'.

And I did remember. The dirty streets. The stench. Everywhere. Suffocating. Nervousness. Tention. Then something horrible happened. Two boys from Hitlerjugend were walking around, laughing joyfully. One of them took the gun from his pocket and started shooting. Window glass broken. A voice: 'Aaa!'. It was not part of this world. It was not part of humanity. I was not a part of it. I was told that these are human beings. They didn’t look like human beings. Then my guide said: 'We might be able to arrange your visit to a death camp'.

What they managed to do is put Karski in a transit camp in Izbica Lubelska, dressed as an Estonian guard. What Karski saw in the Ghetto and in the camp, he had to engrave in his memory, smuggle out of Poland and weaponize. He converted these sights into words that would convince the most powerful people of the world to take action.

What followed was a spy-thriller-style escape from Poland, involving prison escapes and teeth being pulled out in order to disguise foreign accent in Karski’s otherwise impeccable German and French.

There was a secret meeting with British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden. There was the White House conversation with Franklin D. Roosevelt himself. And then the mission was done.

Karski went back to London, but was told that he became identifiable to the Nazis. So his job as a soldier was done too and Karski decided to start a new life in the United States. What didn’t end were the Nazi atrocities. The feeling of failure. And then - in the long run - the haunting memories, the images of inhumanity.

Shoahbegins with an excruciating scene. Karski says: 'Now I go back 35 years'.

But he chokes up and abruptly leaves the room saying: 'No, I don’t go back!'.

It was the first time in many years that he had to revisit the experience. During his 30 year teaching career, Karski failed to mention to his students a story that later made him a towering historical figure, honoured with numerous statues in New York, Washington, Tel Aviv, Warsaw and other cities.

The screening ofShoahon national television marked a turning point late in Karski’s life. Now he was no longer first and foremost a professor. His job title seemed to change. He started being introduced as a 'Witness to the Holocaust'. This caption seems now inseparable from his name. And it sounds like something more than just a description of one of his many life roles, more than a profession even - it’s something from the realm of biblical fate.

At great personal cost, Karski became the role modelpar excellence- the embodiment of the universal task, which every human being is invited to undertake at some point in their life. That is: to look, to remember and to personally confront the inhuman suffering of others.

Tomb sculptures from the Court of Burgundy

In a special guest post to celebrate theCleveland Museum of Art’s (CMA)Open Access initiative, Curatorial Assistant in Medieval Art Amanda Mikolic illuminates the tomb sculpture of the Burgundian court, illustrated by openly licensed images from CMA and European institutions.

The court of theBurgundian Netherlandswas known for the sumptuousness of its art which served as an indication of their rank, wealth, and power. The surviving tomb figures of the Dukes of Burgundy and their relations are a testament to this lavish lifestyle. The Cleveland Museum of Art's celebrated early 15th century alabaster tomb mourners are one of the highlights of its medieval collection.

Originally these figures were arranged in processional order around the sides of the ducal tomb ofPhilip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy(r. 1363–1404).

This marked the beginning of an elaborate Burgundian tomb tradition which would continue throughout the 16th century for the subsequent dukes and their families. These tomb figures, known as weepers (pleurants), represented mourning family members and ancestors. Rather than true portraits, the statuettes are idealised images of Burgundian mourners.

Philip the Bold's son and the next Duke of Burgundy, John the Fearless (r. 1404-1419) continued the tradition with a slightly more elaborate version of his father’s tomb. The predominant feature of this tradition was the long procession of realistic-looking mourning figures who accompanied the deceased, walking beneath the effigy.

Over time these figures became less generic and more like portraits of individuals.

These mourning figures were meant to illustrate the deceased's noble and distinguished ancestors and retain minute details of costume and features with the faces of some being nearly portrait-like in their depiction, although idealised. In the figures once belonging to the tomb of Isabella of Bourbon, daughter of Charles I, Duke of Bourbon (1401–1456) and granddaughter of the powerful John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy (r. 1404–19) the full evolution of these figures can be seen.

Following Isabella of Bourbon’s death in 1465, her daughter Mary built a funeral monument for her mother in theabbey of Saint Michaelin Antwerp. The tomb was surrounded by 24 bronze figures of mourning family members and ancestors, of which just ten remain today.

These figures were themselves modelled after another tomb, commissioned by Philip the Good and located in Lille. From historical records and the detailed costumes, we can even determine the identity of some of these opulently dressed figures, such as Albert I, Duke of Bavaria (1336–1404), depicted with theOrder of Saint Anthonyaround his neck.

Another of the male figures from Isabella's tomb wears a traditional costume popular in the mid-1400s with the court of Philip the Good. The large ring-shaped turban orbourreletwith trailing streamer was favoured by nobility as a sign of prosperity because of the excessive fabric used.

All of these surviving tomb figures testify to the lavish lifestyle, power, and wealth of the Burgundian court. The lasting legacy of Burgundian memorial art cannot be exaggerated, nor can the importance of the tomb figures within this tradition.

How a Swedish family changed American entertainment history

This photograph shows Frank Otto Skeppstedt, his wife and four children stoically posing for a studio photographer.

The formal portrait gives away nothing of their extraordinary family history. At the time this picture was taken, the Skeppstedts (now Shipstads) had settled at St. Paul, Minnesota, after having emigrated from Sweden. Father Frank Otto had found work at a foundry but barely brought in enough to feed his family, that would eventually count ten children.

Yet one of the boys in this portrait, Eddie, was to become one of the biggest names in the American entertainment industry.



It all started in St. Paul, when Eddie (at the time a seller of typewriters) met Oscar Johnson (who worked as a chemist) and joined him in skating on the frozen lakes. Soon they were practicing stunts and got hired to do their act during half-time shows for St. Paul's professional hockey team and New York Rangers games.

Then they were asked to put together a complete variety show on ice. In the meantime, Eddie’s brother Roy Shipstad - a talented skater who won several amateur titles - teamed up with Eddie and Oscar. Together they produced a first show as a charity benefit performance. Afterwards, they decided to take the show on the road.

From these early ventures, in 1936Shipstad's and Johnson's Ice Follieswere born: the first traveling extravaganza on ice.

The Ice Follies were among thepioneering ice showsthat would thrive throughout the 20th century, combining skating with theatre, music, lighting, choreography, music hall entertainment, elaborate props and costumes.

Their main attraction was the complete novelty of the spectacle, that soon rivalled the more old-fashioned circus show in popularity. And thus business took off, with Metro Goldwyn Mayer even producinga film with Ice Follies in 1939. Also in 1939, the comic skating duoFrick and Frackjoined the show.

Soon many other shows started building upon the Shipstads’ success, such as the Hollywood Ice Review, the Holiday on Ice shows (using ingenious mobile rinks) and the Sonja Henie Ice Revue.

Yet the Ice Follies would remain – together with the Ice Capades – among the most successful, playing for over 60 million people in 30 years. In the mid-1960s the Ice Follies were placed within General Ice Shows Inc, that would later buy Holiday on ice as well.

When Mattel acquired both shows in 1979, the idea arose to collaborate with Disney. This resulted in theDisney World on Icetours, that took off in 1981 and run to the present day.

As for the Shipstads: along with the permanent change of their last names, their American adventure brought them fame, fortune, and ... tons of ice! For Eddie’s son and grandson - both named after him – would make their careers directing ice shows as well, while Roy’s daughterJillwould tour with the Ice Follies as a star skater for many glorious years.

What is an illuminated initial?

What are illuminated initials for?

Different types, different styles

Further reading:

Many medieval manuscripts are full of decorated capital letters that add colour to the page. They come in all styles and sizes, but what exactly are they and what was their purpose?

The word illuminate, in the medieval sense, means to decorate with colours. Anilluminated initialis an enlarged and decorated capital letter, the first letter of a section of text.

These can vary from the basicpen-and-ink drawn letterto the more elaborate letters painted with gold or silver leaf. Text and illumination were complementary and were either closely related or sharply contrasted.

Instead of initials, many Hebrew manuscripts have decoratedinitial-word panels. There is no distinction between upper and lower case in Hebrew, so the entire first word was often decorated.

These initials, like other painted elements, were added after the text had been copied, often by a different person – anilluminator.

Space for these letters was marked out and left blank while the scribe worked, with just asmall guide lettermarked so the illuminator would know which letter to paint. In some manuscripts theinitials were never addedand you can see the space that was reserved for them.

Illuminated initials could have several purposes in medieval manuscripts. The most obvious is their decorative or aesthetic value.

The image above includes:

Initials that include human or animal figures in or around them are said to beinhabited. Others may be more abstract, incorporating geometric orinterlacedesigns are simply calleddecorated initials.

They could also be used to illustrate the text, in addition to or instead of miniatures.Historiated initialsshow a scene or a recognisable person that relates to the text, in and around the shape of the letter. Sometimes illuminated initials contrast with the text: they might show irreverent or humorous figures and scenes.

The image above includes:

The image above includes:

When animal or human figures form the shape of the letter, these are calledzoomorphicoranthropomorphicinitials, or evenzoo-anthropomorphicif there are both people and animals.

Beyond decoration and illustration, the primary role of illuminated initials was more practical. They provide a visual point of reference, marking the division of the text into books, chapters, paragraphs and sometimes even verses.

Three different sizes of initials, in alternating gold and blue with blue and redpen-flourishing, mark the major and minor divisions within Guillaume de Machaut's poem 'Remède de Fortune' produced in Paris around 1350-1355.

Unlike books published today, medieval manuscripts do not have title pages. New chapters do not generally start on a new page, because parchment was costly and the space on the page had to be used carefully.

Illuminated initials can look very different from one manuscript to another, and even within the same manuscript. This may depend on several factors:

The image above includes (from left to right):

A puzzle initial is a letter divided into interlocking pieces, often painted red and blue, with a fine line of white to separate the two parts.

Styles and techniques particular to one region would spread as scribes and illuminators travelled and exchanged ideas and techniques. One example of this is theChannel School.

This style of illumination flourished on either side of the English Channel during the 11th and 12th centuries, and also influenced illuminators as far away as Bavaria and Bohemia.

Initials in the Channel School style, from left to right:

This practice continued with thefirst printed books, which were designed to resemble manuscripts as closely as possible. Many printers left space on the page so that initials and other elements could later be added by hand, according to the owner’s specifications.

Zala Mojca Jerman Kuželički of National and University Library in Slovenia introduces us to Ivan Cankar, who died 100 years ago today and is regarded as the greatest writer in the Slovene language.

Ivan Cankar, the first professional and most prolific Slovene writer and playwright, is mostly known for his skilful depictions of the petty bourgeoisie and the margins of society; his hometownVrhnika; for thecoffeehe made his poor mother go beg for and then refused to drink, and the wine he’d never refuse to drink. He is hailed for his sweet language of sorrow and nostalgia, and the suffering somehow made beautiful.

What usually doesn’t come to mind is Vienna and migration. Cankar was a proud Slovenian, always giving praise to the Slavic nations and Slovene, but it must be noted that he spent a major and highly influential part of his most fruitful years inVienna, Austria.

Vienna back then was, of course, the capital of Austrian Empire, Cankar’s own country. It only made sense at the time for any young person aspiring to any sort of greatness to pack their bags and leave (possibly by train, but mostly on foot) their home towns and villages for the broad, gleaming streets of the capital.

Cankar joined the battalion of youngsters gravitating toward the centre of everything to continue his technical studies at the VienneseTechnische Hochschule.

While enamoured with the city, he quickly grew restless in his classes, dissatisfied with the underwhelming challenges and dry technical language. Deciding to enrol instead at the Department of Philology to study Romance and Slavic languages, he lost his scholarship and took to writing as a means of making ends meet.

Thus began the career of Slovenia’s greatest writer. The metropolis offered Cankar a most colourful array of people to get to know and be inspired by; there, he rubbed shoulders with other writers, thinkers, bohemians and many great personas of the time likeStefan ZweigandSigmund Freud.

He participated in heated literary discussions in the notorious Beethoven Café, had easy access to all the important magazines, and got to experience first-hand the latest literary trends. His career blossomed. With his sardonic talent for hitting the nail on the head andhis unwavering independence, he was quickly becoming the most sought-after writer back home. The conservatives feared him, the liberals ridiculed him; the public adored him.

At the same time, living in Vienna brought Cankar face to face witha new level of povertyandprofound homesickness; an experience that crucially influenced his work and radicalised him.

His political ideas about the clergy, the Austrian Empire, socialism and Slavic nations earned him an enormous amount of censorship, yet he persisted as the voice of the voiceless, the beacon of hope for the hopeless, the empathetic hug for the untouchables.

In 1908, after ten years of the metropolitan life, Cankar left Vienna. Growing perhaps tired of the constant hubbub of the great city, he retired to Rožnik, a small hill perched atop Ljubljana.

He continued writing profusely until his untimely death at 42, on 11 December 1918, his Vienna-won wisdom infusing every letter. It is for Cankar’s deep understanding of the human psyche and the constant calling out of theinjusticesof human society that we still cherish his work today.

The National and University Library is currently displaying “I AM CANKAR – THAT SAYS IT ALL!" an exhibition presenting a selection of letters from Ivan Cankar's legacy. The exhibition runs until 26 January 2019.More info.

Learn about the Iberians

In last week's blogThe history of the Iberians, we gave a high-level overview of the Iberian peoples. Today, we focus on the iconography shown in Iberian art and objects from archaeological research, and what it says about the social structures, beliefs, and myths of the Iberians.

Certain cultural features define the Iberian societies, perhaps the most noteworthy being Iberian pottery. This was decorated in red with mainly geometric forms, although in some areas (from Murcia to the south of Catalonia) figurative images were added. The art of these societies was characterised by powerful iconography: images were one of their best and most effective methods of dissemination and propaganda. Studying this iconography offers us an insight into the ideologically complex beliefs, narratives, and myths of the Iberians. Expounded in the towns, shrines and cemeteries, as well as into their myths, both heroic and divine. All this gives us an idea of the ideological complexity of those cultures.Supernatural and mythical beings. Left:Wolf. Sanctuary of El Pajarillo (Huelma, Spain); centre:Griffin. Sculptural group of Cerrillo Blanco (Porcuna, Spain); right:Patera of the Treasure ofPerotito (Santiesteban del Puerto, Spain). A great example of this is Iberianeschatology(i.e. the Iberian theological beliefs about the end of the world). For Iberian societies, the hereafter was a continuity of life; death was seen as the starting point for a journey symbolised by a crossing of the sea, the land or even the sky. Supernatural and mythical beings, such as the Sphinx, the Griffin or the wolf, and sometimes the divinity, accompanied and guided the deceased on this journey. The crossing of this threshold of death culminated in a celebration, a place of reunion symbolised by abundance. All this was channelled through a funerary ritual characterised by the funerary banquet, the libations, the cremation and the definition of the spaces in the necropolis that linked the hereafter to the territory. The configuration and meaning of those spaces varied according to the historical period of the Iberian societies. It is noteworthy that, at a certain time in the late 5th century BC and, above all, in the mid-4th century BC, perfectly hierarchised funerary landscapes were laid out. In these landscapes, not only can we identify social groups differentiated on the basis of grave goods, tomb types and spatial distribution, we can also clearly see the relations with the ancestors and the divinity. The necropolises of Baza and Tútugi (both in Granada province, Spain) are clear examples.Burial mounds. Left:Burial chamber of Piquía(Arjona, Spain); right:Burial mound 75. Cemetery of Tútugi (Galera, Spain)

The cultural and social diversity of the Iberian societies is reflected in their wide variety of urban and rural sanctuaries. In general, archaeological research has focused on the analysis of sanctuaries or urban sacred sites that served to emphasise the ideological representational role of certain communities and their dominant lineages in the bosom of the power centres. These urban sanctuaries could be collective or family worship sites. Collective sanctuaries reflected the power of a town and its community in the structuring of the political landscape. Places of worship associated with the more restricted scope of the family or lineage were linked to the cults and rituals of ancestor veneration.Iberian Sanctuaryof Cueva de la Lobera and bronce exvote (Castellar, Spain) Rural worship sites demonstrate the function of religiosity in the processes of territorial cohesion and control. They often defined the enshrinement of the territorial boundaries by placing worship sites on the frontiers. Those sanctuaries strengthened the relationship between the town and its political spaces and concretised the relations of the community with their neighbours. They were true centres of representation to which pilgrimages were organised to hold the most important community rituals (initiation, nuptial, aggregation, etc.). Of particular note, due to their size, are the sanctuaries of Collado de los Jardines (Santa Elena, Jaén) and Cueva de la Lobera (Castellar, Jaén). These worship sites were in the territory of the oppidum of Cástulo (Linares) and became true symbolic and territorial centres of reference, above all during the 3rd century BC.

Take ingredients from Naples

Roll the dough across the seas

Add toppings to taste

Enjoy with a side of tradition

Behind a simple pizza lies a more complex history

Pizza - possibly one of the most popular, tasty and simple things you can have for dinner tonight. But behind its simplicity lies a much more complex history - this is the tale of the Margherita's migration.

Pizza has been around in Italy for more than 1,000 years in differing forms. What we recognise today as pizza was popularised in Naples. This dish began to conquer the world in the 19th century.

The 'Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana' ('True Neapolitan Pizza Association'), which was founded in 1984, sets the very specific rules that must be followed for an authentic Neapolitan pizza. For example, many Naples pizzerias will only use San Marzano tomatoes grown on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius. This video showsNeapolitans living and working in Milan in the 1960s, with some working in the pizza industry.

Today, however, you don't need to be in Naples, or even Italy, to get your hands on a great pizza. In many ways, this is due to movement and migration.

A number of factors led to a rise in the popularity of pizza around the world.

Large numbers of Italians migrated to the United States in the 19th and 20th centuries, bringing with them their local food traditions which were enjoyed mainly by Italian and Italian-American communities.

What would those original migrants think to the now-iconic New York-style pizza, cut into huge slices with extra thin crusts that you fold in half to eat?

Pizza's popularity boomed in the years after World War II.

Allied troops stationed in Italy during the war ate and enjoyed pizza, bringing their taste for the dish home to their countries. During the 1950s and 1960s, increased prosperity and leisure times led to populations from other Western European countries holidaying inItaly, discovering the delicious dish and creating an appetite back home for it.

In these decades too, many Italians moved to Germany, Sweden, Netherlands and other Western European countries as guest workers, and later established their own restaurants.

These photographs of pizzerias in Swedish towns in Örebro County all have names associated with Italy:Pizzeria Italia,Pizzeria Roma,Pizzeria Verona,Pizzeria Mona LisaandPizzeria Colosseo.

Like the good ingredients of a pizza, all these factors combined to bring pizza to the world. In the collections gathered in Europeana.eu, we see evidence of pizza's popularity.

Local food traditions in individual countries now combine with the original Italian pizza recipes.

Japanese people enjoy pizza with squid and Tabasco. Banana toppings are popular in Iceland andSweden. Hungarian pizzas, promoted in the leaflet above, boast sausage, smoked knuckles, beans, leek and mustard-sour cream sauce.

In Sweden, one of the most popular dishes - now considered a Swedish tradition - is kebabpizza. It combines pizza, 'brought' to Sweden by Italian guest workers, with kebab, brought to Sweden by Turkish and Middle Eastern guest workers.

We can also see examples of the mixing of migrant communities' food traditions in the Netherlands: here are thegyros pizzaand thetandoori chicken pizza.

But, in some cases, the age-old Italian traditions still remain.

At the Roads of Remembrance and Identity - Migration Stories from Romania collection day in Sibiu, we heard fromGheorghi, a Bulgarian man who trained in Italy to be a pizzaiolo and now owns a pizzeria in Romania:

My strong wish is to carry on the tradition of making good and healthy food, to preserve the old pizza recipes, innovating at the same time. I have brought with me from Italy four traditional pizza peels and even some high quality oven plates made from refractory materials from the Vesuvius Area.

So the next time you tuck into a pizza, think about the ingredients and where these have come from, and the communities who have migrated around the world and helped this dish from a city in the south of Italy become a world favourite.

Diversity in time and space

An aristocratic and clientele society

Iconography

The end of the Iberians

Archaeological research provides us with a broad overview of the past life of cultures and communities. One such culture that has seen extensive archaeological study is the Iberians.

We use the generic name Iberians to refer to a group of peoples who inhabited a large part of the Iberian Peninsula for much of the first millennium. This is a brief overview of their history, their political structures, and their demise.



The Iberians lived along the Mediterranean coast and in the south and centre of the Iberian Peninsula, as well as in the French Languedoc region.

The large cultural area of the ancient Mediterranean was the staging ground of the historical dynamic between the 6th-1st centuries BC that the Iberian peoples took part in. The term Iberian encompasses a huge diversity. Iberian society was a mosaic of political entities with common cultural features, as well as their own regional and local traits.

Ancient writers referred to them by different names: Oretani, Contestani, Bastetani, Indiketi, Edetani, etc.

These people shared a language that today we call Iberian. Of course, that does not mean there were no other languages, as we have evidence of others on the Iberian Peninsula just prior to Romanisation.

In the late 5th and early 4th centuries BC, we see a series of important social changes that would lead to the consolidation of an aristocracy and the emergence of aclientele system.

This meant that a single aristocrat or prince would become a dominant leader of groups of people who supported him and his lineage. This new political system led, among other things, to cities and towns that centered around these leaders, also known as territorial nucleation.

In this context, theoppidumor fortified Iberian town became the centre of reference in the landscape and the political space. The town focused and organised the territory and, mainly from the 4th century BC on, led expansion programmes.

This meant that the differences between towns became more evident and the hierarchy in the territory accentuated. The Iberian landscape stayed heterogeneous in the way that its towns were constructed, however: the Romans did territorial organisation very differently, and not all Iberian towns became oppida.

Iberian pottery is a unique and distinguishing feature of this culture.

Most Iberian pottery was decorated in red with mainly geometric forms, although in some areas (from Murcia to the south of Catalonia) figurative images were added.

The powerful iconography of these societies made the images on pottery a great way of sharing information and spreading propaganda. Studying this iconography offers us an insight into the ideologically complex beliefs, narratives, and myths of the Iberians.

A great example of this is Iberian eschatology (i.e. the Iberian theological beliefs about the end of the world).

For Iberian societies, the hereafter was a continuity of life. Death was seen as the starting point for a journey symbolised by a crossing of the sea, the land or even the sky. Supernatural and mythical beings, such as the Sphinx or the wolf, and sometimes Divinity itself, accompanied and guided the deceased on this journey.

The crossing of this threshold of death culminated in a celebration, a place of reunion symbolised by abundance.

TheSecond Punic Warshook the deeply-rooted social and political structures of the Iberian societies.

In the final years of the 3rd century BC, the Iberian peninsula became the staging ground for the war between Carthage and Rome, accelerating a series of transformations that affected all levels of life. Iberia soon came under the effective domination of the Roman victors.

This process did not affect the whole Iberian area in the same way, as the official interests varied according to the territory. It is, therefore, difficult to summarise such a complex and varied process that in the late 1st century BC would lead to the end of the Iberian societies, as they became integrated into the homogeneity of the Roman structure.

How historic press reported the ship's sinking

In the early morning of 15 April 1912, one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history occurred. RMS Titanic - which was considered unsinkable - was on her maiden voyage in the North Atlantic when she collided with an iceberg.

Her sinking was one of the first and most significant international news stories of the early 20th century, with newspapers around the globe featuring daily updated stories and reports as more and more details of the tragedy became apparent being spread.

Not all newspapers across Europe and around the world covered the Titanic’s sinking equally. The historical newspapers gathered inEuropeana Newspapersallow us to see how the event was reported throughout different countries and newspaper titles. More than that, they also give us further insights into the varied newspaper styles and editorial decisions of the time.

Tip: to see the newspapers in more detail, click through the images to be able to zoom in

One of the earliest reports was made on 16 April in the French newspaper Le Petit Parisien.

They ran the story under the headline 'World’s biggest ocean liner hits an iceberg'. The timely news coverage came at the price of accuracy: unfortunately, the subheading 'Happily it was possible to save all 2,358 people on board' did not turn out to be true.

During the next few days, victims were estimated to be anywhere between 1400 and 2000 individuals. Various newspapers speculated on the potential death toll for several days before more accurate figures could be made available.

In Romania, the sinking of the Titanic already made the news on 9 April – six days before she did actually sink. How could they have predicted the collision? This discrepancy can be easily explained: dates in Western Europe are based on the Gregorian calendar but Romania followed the Julian calendar until 1919. The converted date becomes 22 April in the Gregorian calendar.

The sinking of the Titanic dominated newspaper headlines for many days following the collision as more and more details about the incident came to light.

Initially, many newspapers portrayed the horror using dramatic sketches and illustrations of the sinking steamship, such as those by the illustrated daily newspaper Die Neue Zeitung from Vienna, Austria. This was at a time when the use of photographs in newspapers was still in its early stages and most graphic newspaper content was received in the form of engravings.

Eventually, more investigative articles appeared, which went on to explore the technical details of the disaster, such as the likely profile of the iceberg that the ship hit and whether the Titanic actually had enough lifeboats on board.

The sinking of the Titanic was met with worldwide shock. Although the tragedy resonated with an international readership, the news of the collision soon gave way to other stories in the headlines of European newspapers. Public inquiries after the incident eventually led to the establishment of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) as well as to other major improvements, which still govern maritime safety to this day.

11-11 Memories retold

When thinking of a World War I game, some images immediately come to mind: huge battlefields where players shoot each other over and over again, constantly dying and respawning, gamers shouting at each other through their headsets, tanks rolling over your dead virtual corpse just to spite you.

11-11 Memories Retold is a World War I game, but it is as far removed from the clichés in that genre as can be.



Maybe the most striking thing about this game is its graphics. The game studio Bandai Namco paired up with DigixArt and Aardman animations to create a painterly art style for the game, every item and effect made up of individual shifting brushstrokes.

As a player, you feel like you’re immersed in a living impressionist painting, with vivid colours and beautiful lighting effects that makes you stop and stare at the scenery every so often. What’s more is that the art style aids in the narrative development, conveying emotions through the drab grey skies of the front versus the warm fuzzy colours of home.

The story follows German Kurt and Canadian Harry in their experiences of the last months of World War I.

They both join the war for different reasons, in a different context, and their stories intertwine as they both end up at the front in Vimy, France.

You discover the plot of the game through beautifully narrated voice work from none other than Elijah Wood as Harry and Sebastian Koch as Kurt. The sound design and music of the game blend beautifully with the voiceover work to create an immersive storytelling experience where you become invested in the lives of the characters you’re playing as, making decisions that impact the story as you go.

World War I feels even more real in this game, as real-world memories have found their way into 11-11 Memories Retold.

The developers worked together with, among others, Europeana, to fill their game world with historical footage and objects. Throughout the story, you can find collectable scraps of paper on the ground that combine to reveal historical context along with a digitised object from that era. These little bits of flavour create an incentive to explore the game world more to find these collectables.

The inclusion of these real memories of the past makes 11-11 Memories Retold cross the line between being a fictitious storytelling experience and an immersive form of remembrance.

11-11 Memories retold is especially reminiscent of Valiant Hearts: the Great War, a game by Ubisoft that came out in 2014. It combines a specific art style, two crossing paths, storytelling without the use of gun combat, and the inclusion of historical context, into a beautiful form of gaming as remembrance.

There’s something poetic in the fact that Valiant Hearts came out 100 years since the beginning of World War I. The launch of Memories Retold heralds the centenary of the end of the Great War.

Europeana will be remembering the end of World War 1, and the finale of the Europeana 14-18 campaign, at the centenary tour finale in Brussels on 27-28 November.

10. Take a dive into Europe’s rich past

This week Europeana celebrates its 10th birthday. Since 2008, we’ve been publishing, sharing and celebrating amazing cultural heritage online.

To mark the occasion, we’re highlighting ten things we think make Europeana special (it wasn’t easy – even if we say so ourselves!). So, here’s our top ten: one for every year we’ve been transforming the world with culture.

This might just as well become our new slogan! You might not have the time or money to visit all your favourite museums in person.

With Europeana, you can virtually visit thousands of libraries, galleries, archives and museums from all over Europe without having to change out of your pyjamas. Travel hundreds of kilometres in mere seconds whiletaking in every sight, from Barcelona to Norway to Naples and back again.

With Europeana, you can see every inch of aGreek bustto discover what Apollo’s curls look like from the back, or take in every frill and rhinestone ofa stunning pink dress.

Because Europeana is filled with cultural heritage from every country and every era, you can also enjoy cultural heritage from all sides in a more figurative sense, i.e. from different points of view.

The art style that emerged as a reaction to 19th-century academic art developed differently in different countries and was called different names:Art Nouveau, Secession, Jugendstil, Skønvirke, Modernism.

With Europeana, you can contrast and compare all these different expressions of the same reaction, for instance by looking atthe poster artof that era.

The Mauritshuis in The Hague houses ‘The Bull’, a huge work of art by Paulus Potter measuring more than 3.3 metres in length and 2.3 metres in height.

Not even the tallest Dutch person would be able to marvel at the detail put into the lone bird at the top right corner of the painting. In Europeana, you can take a look at every millimetre of even the largest artworks, without having to stand on your toes.

Whether you want to inspect every petal of every flower ina lithographortry to find Jesus in a 16th-century painting’s version ofWhere’s Waldo?, Europeana has you covered.

With high-resolution zoomable images, you can now come closer to a painting than you ever would be allowed to in a museum without alarms going off.



We all have our own stories to tell, and it’s a joy to share those stories with others. Europeana gives everyone the opportunity to tell their own stories and share the objects connected to those stories.

The Europeana migration campaign allows you torecord your migration storyand share it with everyone. Those contributions help us to tell the big story of Europe and the people who live there.

Similarly, Europeana’sWorld War I collectiondisplays stories and objects from people who have shared their or their family members’ tales of the First World War. 100 years after the end of the Great War, recording and telling these stories shows the importance of remembrance of our shared history.

If you enjoy a niche pastime or collection, chances are Europeana has stuff that makes you geek out.

Are you an entomologist, or do you simply love creepy crawlies? How about astory about beetles and butterflies from Turkestan? Maybe you’re interested in early forms of photography, and just adoredaguerrotypes. If you’ve got an obsession withNetsuke, which are small Japanese sculptures from the 17th century, we’ve got you covered. Or maybe you stand in awe of huge tractors and otheragricultural machines.

Every hobby, collection and obsession has its place in Europeana.

Europeana is a valuable resource used by other creative initiatives and projects to bring culture to life.

Apps and games are developed using Europeana content to provide rich historical content, like the snippets of historical photographs you pick up inyour journey through a World War 1 Game. Europeana can be of immense value to educational programs, exemplified bythis appdeveloped to teach children the sounds of European songbirds. Researchers study objects provided by Europeana, which leads to outcomes like awebsitededicated to showing Roma people and their customs in historical context.

One of our favourite projects isArt up your Tab, a browser extension that gives you a beautiful work of art when you open a new tab!

Maybe the best part of Europeana is that you’ve never seen it all.

Whether you’re browsing throughphotography,art,manuscripts, orWorld War I, you’re sure to find the best of Europe collected in one place.

For 10 years, Europeana has been collecting cultural heritage from galleries, libraries, archives and museum from all over Europe. Who knows what you’ll be able to find on Europeana in 2028? Here’s to another ten years!

Creating Loyalty and Broadening Readership

Before and After the 1881 Legislation

The serialisation of the novel

In France, the important development of including literature in the press began with the launch of 'La Presse' in 1836 byEmile de Girardin. He cut the subscription rate to his daily newspaper in half by speculating onadvertisingto cover the costs. He also developed theserialised novelto create customer loyalty, by calling on the biggest names in literature at that time, includingHonoré de Balzac,Eugène Sue,Alexandre DumasandGeorge Sand.

_‘L'Echo des feuilletons’, 1842. Bibliothèque nationale de France, No Copyright - Other Known Restrictions

Editors-in-chief also saw the value of literature in the press and started to hire newjournaliststo reach a wider audience.

Familie-Journalen læses!, 1895. Bibliothèque nationale de France, No Copyright - Other Known Restrictions

This demand brought reinforcements to ageneration of literary menwho divided their activities betweennewspapers,theatre, writingnovelsand "physiologies" (caricatured descriptions of society): this group of younger writers aspired to a literary career. Some of these writers came no longer from the elite, but from among the so-calledbohemians. The bohemians used the press as their usual means of publication and as a legitimising authority, forming the base of literary criticism in France.

The media-friendly bohemians functioned like a shifting group of "day labourers" in journalism, moving from one editorial board to another, learning from older members of the profession,launching new publicationsand, most of all, injecting journalism with a new,more insolentand artistic, tone. They imposed on the whole profession both their manner of addressing social issues, in relation to fashions and new urban practices, and a style that placed Parisian wit andbanterat the heart of their writing.

‘Le Bouffon’: satirical newspaper, 28 February 1867. Bibliothèque nationale de France, No Copyright - Other Known Restrictions

In addition to the bohemians, the entry onto the scene of journalists educated at university or the Ecole normale (for instanceEdmond About,Francisque Sarcey) greatly improved the quality of writing, the range of topics addressed and especially the theatrical, literary and artistic critiques. Following the work of literary criticCharles-Augustin Sainte-Beuve, they found their natural place in the press.

A second factor in the growth of literature in the press in France is related to the repressive legal regime. As a result of  its censorship, which began with the September 1835 laws and was further radicalised by the1852 legislation, a number of weekly literary or lifestyle newspapers emerged: the "petits journaux" or "little newspapers". The 29 July 1881 law for freedom of the press ushered in a golden age for the press that was to last until France’s defeat in 1940. As the number of general information newspapers multiplied, the journalistic profession became more structured and more independent of the literary circles.



‘Journal officiel de la République française’, 30 July 1881. Bibliothèque nationale de France, No Copyright - Other Known Restrictions

During the French Third Republic (1870-1940), political daily newspapers emphasised the presence of literature in the press, giving free rein to the constant reinvention of media forms and at the same time creating well-known literary supplements. Newspapers such as 'Le Figaro', 'Le Gaulois', 'L'Écho de Paris' and 'Gil Blas' are key to literature studies. They can be seen as an incubator of forms, ideas and genres. Without them, we would have an incomplete picture of what was known as "the literary movement".

Novelist and journalist

A true writer-journalist,Emile Zolasuccessfully managed both activities for about 20 years, at first out of financial necessity before he became a successful author, but also by conviction.Poster advertising the publication of Emile Zola's 'La Débâcle' in the newspaper 'Le Radical', 1892, Bibliothèque nationale de France, No Copyright - Other Known Restrictions He sent his first articles to newspapers in 1863. His early contributions were critiques of the art and literature of his day, but his articles soon turned political and took on a combative tone. Having mocked the French Second Empire (1852-1870) as a "feeding frenzy" in 'La Cloche' on 13 April 1870, Zola founded the patriotic newspaper 'La Marseillaise' in the middle of the Franco-Prussian War. It was at that point that he became a political journalist, writing from the benches of the Assembly which had taken refuge in Versailles.

As an author writing in the naturalist genre, Zola showed the keen perception of a journalist in his writing and he considered his activity in the press to be genuine writer's work. In this sense, the two aspects of his writing were closely related. "We are all children of the press", he stated in 'Le Figaro' on 22 September 1881, as he announced his intention to leave journalism. It is surprising that his temporary retirement from journalism happened the same year as a majorlaw for freedom of the presscame into effect, almost as though the writer was leaving the battlefield once victory had been assured. While temporarily withdrawn from political jousting in the press, Zola expressed concern in 1894 in the 'Annales politiques et littéraires' about the "state of nervous over-excitement in which current journalism is holding the nation". Yet he did not stay silent very long: his opinion column "Pour les Juifs" in 'Le Figaro' on 16 May 1896 gave him the opportunity to directly oppose Edouard Drumont's antisemitic statements. It also foreshadowed his extremely famous open letter "J'accuse !"("I accuse!"), published in Georges Clémenceau's paper 'L'Aurore' on 13 January 1898, which made him the centre of attention and marked the point when "intellectuals" took on a central role in public debate.

This episode illustrates all the skill of a man who was well-versed in the workings of the press and perfectly aware of the impact his article would have. The Dreyfus Affair, covered by newspapersin real time and day by day, turned Zola into one of themain protagonistsin a legal and political controversy. According to 'La Croix' on 14 January 1898, "Mr Zola published an abusive diatribe this morning in which he makes the most inflammatory accusations".

Once he had become a renowned novelist, Zola saw his work abundantly commented upon in the literary press, for example in the'Le Figaro' literary supplementin 1890 when 'L'Argent' ('Money') was published. He also became a selling point for newspapers, as shown by the announcements and poster advertisements that various papers produced.Poster advertising the publication of Emile Zola's 'Fécondité'in the newspaper 'L'Aurore', 1899.Bibliothèque nationale de France, No Copyright - Other Known Restrictions'Le Cri du peuple' announced the publication of 'Germinal' in this way in 1885, 'Le Journal' announced'Paris'in 1897, while in 1899 'L'Aurore' did the same for 'Fécondité' ('Fruitfulness'). Others include the illustrated newspaper 'L'Omnibus', which published'Pot-Bouille'('Pot Luck') and 'L'Assomoir' ('The Dram Shop') for example, as well as the daily paper'Gil Blas'.

Shipped around the world

Postage and packing

Destination - the Americas

Stories from Croatia and Romania

If you ever visit the Netherlands, perhaps you'll stay at the Lloyd Hotel in Amsterdam or Hotel New York in Rotterdam. These two hotels - still operational - played witness to decades of migration through the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Both hotels were owned by shipping lines - the Lloyd hotel was owned by Royal Holland Line (Koninklijke Hollandsche Lloyd) and Hotel New York by the Holland-Amerika Line (Nederlandsch Amerikaansche Stoomvaart Maatschappij).

Both hotels were used as temporary accommodation for those migrating from Europe. Often, package deals were available which would combine a train ticket, hotel accommodation and passage over the oceans.

Hotel New York provided respite for people migrating to North America. Initially, in the late 19th century, people staying there were migrating from the Netherlands and Germany, but later those moving from Eastern Europe and Russia stayed there too.

Between 1921 and 1935, the Lloyd Hotel housed people migrating to South America.

The hotel could cater for up to 900 people, who stayed there on their journeys from Poland, Romania, Hungary and the Balkans. Many were leaving behind the poverty of their homelands to go to South America, where labour was needed for agriculture. Voyages from Amsterdam were to Buenos Aires with calls at Boulogne, Plymouth, Coruna, Lisbon, Las Palmas, Pernambuco, Bahia, Rio de Janeiro, Santos and Montevideo.

In a nearby quarantine building, people had a medical checkup and a shower before their long journey. These checkups were important as, should someone be refused at the destination port, the shipping line would have to pay for their passage back to Europe - something they were keen to avoid.

At the Europeana Migration collection days inZagrebandSibiu, we heard stories of people who emigrated from Eastern Europe to the Americas at the time these Dutch hotels were hosting migrants.

Perhaps the travellers in our stories even stayed at one of them. We don't know.

But what we do know is that their stories illustrate the kinds of journeys, highs, lows and emotions that the people who passed through these hotels experienced too. Next time you're in a hotel, think about its history and the hundreds of people who lay their head on the pillow before you. Not every hotel is for holidays. Read about:

European Robin

Eurasian Blue Tit

European Goldfinch

Birdie Memory

Listen, remember, enjoy

Living in bustling cities we often tend to forget about nature, yet it is all around us and in many ways. Some of us might wake up in the morning to the sounds of a couple of birds singing while others hear their tunes through a stroll in the park or while waiting for some sort of public transport to take them along their merry way.  Though we may sometimes see or hear them, do we know which ones sing what songs? We’ve picked out three bird songs from Europeana Collections most common birds across Europe. These sounds brought to you by the British Library and the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin are guaranteed to make you take a pause (in your busy life) and listen a little longer if you come across the three little birds pitched by your doorstep.

Robins are quite common and favoured winter garden birds because of how well they have adapted to living alongside people and keeping gardeners company in the winter. The male robin is very territorial and will sing throughout the year. Around Christmas, the male robin will sing more powerfully due to breeding territories becoming established. During breeding season, they will start their morning song an hour before sunrise and end half an hour after sunset. In urban areas that are artificially lit, they may be heard singing as a way to shunt daytime human noise pollution.

The Eurasian blue tit is found almost everywhere in Europe. It sings mostly in late winter and spring as a means to defend its territory or attract mates. Calls are used to communicate with other Eurasian blue tits. They inform one another on their location in trees by means of contact-calls. They use alarm-calls to warn others (including birds of other species such as the great tit, the European robin or thetreecreeper) about the presence of predators in the neighbourhood.

The striking red, black and white head and gold patches on the wings of this bird makes it instantly recognisable. It is commonly bred in captivity because of its beautiful appearance and song. In the wild, the goldfinch likes impenetrable environments and breeds wherever thistles, burdock and teasels grow. In Britain, during the 19th century, many thousands of goldfinches were trapped yearly and sold as cage-birds. One of the earliest campaigns of theSociety for the Protection of Birdswas directed against this.

The beauty of these three and other birds songs from theBritish LibraryandNatural History Museum in Berlincollections on Europeana inspired the French multimedia designers Léna Mazilu and Yoann Guény to take part in the#edTech Challenge 2018. They won it with theBirdie Memoryproject which invites kids to discover 20 European birds and their sounds by using a mobile app in combination with a visually stimulating and animated poster. Kids and adults alike are encouraged to become more aware of the nature around them, learn about the diversity of wildlife, and improve their visual observations skills and sound memory. The app is available in French, English and Spanish. It can be downloaded for free on theAppStoreandGoogle Playwhile the poster can be purchased at a small price on the Birdie Memorywebsite. Enjoy!

(Re)discovery of the Gutenberg Bible in Berlin

Moveable Type

Unique Copies through Illuminations

Do we know what it was?

How do we know what Europe’s first printed book was? Until the 18th century this question was open to speculation. 15th-century printed books usually have no title page and do not always give the printer’s name.

Volume 1 folio 1 of three copies of the Gutenberg Bible, held at three different libraries. From left to right:Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin - PK, CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 DE;National Library of Scotland, CC BY;Bibliothèque nationale de France (vellum copy), No Copyright – Other Known Legal Restrictions.

A reliable historical source from 1499, the Cologne ‘Cronica’, had told of theGutenberg Bibles, however, their locations were either unknown or they were undated and therefore not credible. Around 25 copies of the first Bible printed in two columns with 42 lines per page were identified during the course of the 18th century. The name of the printer, Johannes Gutenberg, does not appear in any of them. Today we know of 49 of the 180 originally printed42-line Bibles. Of these 21 are complete.

What happened? Christoph Hendreich (1630-1702), head librarian of Berlin’s Electoral Library, discovered a two-volume Latin Bible in folio format in the library’s collections. It was printed on vellum in a gothic font known as black letter. Hendreich linked his find to the 1499 Cologne ‘Cronica’.

Opening page of the book of Genesis,vol. 1 f. 5, Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin - PK, CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 DE

However, his discovery remained a hidden gem until 1760 when the scholar Karl Conrad Oelrich published a facsimile of an extract from the Bible. This dramatically changed the situation: scholars used Oelrich’s facsimile to identify other copies of the Gutenberg Bible from the same edition. This copy is still preserved in the Berlin State Library.

The Gutenberg Bible was produced in Mainz in 1455. It is the first book in Europe to be printed using moveable type: a system of printing that uses individual units of letters and punctuation marks. A mixture of lamp soot, varnish and egg white was used for ink. The text was printed either on vellum, i.e. parchment, or on paper. Vellum was more durable and thicker but also more expensive.

Following the manuscript tradition, copies of the Gutenberg Bible were normally decorated at the instruction of their purchasers, mostly monastic houses.

Thevellum copy at the Bibliothèque nationale de Francehas particularly impressive illuminations: spectacular marginal decorations on two pages and a huge variety of illuminated first letters or initials.The illuminations correlate with those in amodel book(Musterbuch) for illuminators that was in use at the time. The borders resemble others that were in circulation in the same region and around the same time as the Gutenberg Bible.

TheGöttingen Model Book(Staats- und Universitätsbibliothek Göttingen, f. 11v) on the left shows examples of acanthus leaf borders in different colour combinations that are very similar in style to the marginal decoration in the BnF vellum copy of the Gutenberg Bible (vol. 3 f. 1, right). Other motifs found in the Musterbuch are also repeated in various illuminated initials throughout this copy. Bibliothèque nationale de France, No Copyright – Other Known Legal Restrictions

The paper copy at the National Library of Scotland has fewer illuminations; they are in gold and colour and originate in Germany, possibly at Erfurt. The Bible has marginal notes in a continental hand. It probably remained on the Continent until it came into the possession of David Steuart (1747-1824), the former Lord Provost of Edinburgh, in 1796. He sold it to the Advocates Library, the National Library’s predecessor, for 150 guineas.

The only other book Johannes Gutenberg seems to have printed was a schoolbook: theLatin grammar by Donatus. The printing process with movable type pioneered by him was soon taken up by others. By the end of the 15th century, printing presses had been established in more than 250 towns and cities across Europe.

Discover a very unusual picture

Ross MacFarlaneis a Research Development Specialist at London’sWellcome Collection, a free museum and library exploring health, life and our place in the world. In this guest post, Ross explores the phenomenon ofanamorphic artthrough an unusual religious painting depicting not one, not two, but three saints.The current Pope,Francis I, took inspiration for his name fromSt Francis of Assisi– founder of the Franciscan movement and noted for his frugality and humble lifestyle. This 17th-century painting in the Wellcome collection depicts St Francis, dressed in the habit of the order he founded and with the marks of stigmata mirroring the crucifix he holds in the same hand:

This figure, wearing a cowl and holding a paper lettered CHARITAS, can be identified as another St Francis –St Francis of Paola(St Francis of Paul). Not as well-remembered as St Francis of Assisi, St Francis of Paola followed in the path of his namesake, being taught by Franciscans, living a life of frugality and humility and founding the Hermits of Saint Francis of Assisi. He was also renowned in his lifetime as a thaumaturge or miracle worker, active both in Italy and in France. As those are the images observable from left and right, it’s perhaps not too surprising that if one looks straight on at the painting, a third different figure is revealed:

Saint Peter, unknown artist, c. 17th century. Wellcome Collection,CC BY

Whilst the first two representations suggest this might be a third Saint Francis, the two teardrops falling from the figure’s right eye – being a feature of many visual depictions ofSaint Peter(who, according to the Gospels, burst into tears after denying Christ for the third time) – suggest that it is he, rather than another Saint Francis that is depicted here. Where did this painting come from? Its baroque style suggests it originated in the seventeenth century, and is probably from the region of Naples – where St Francis of Paola was especially venerated – or from Spain. The key to how the painting works is in its physical shape. The two side paintings are painted on vertical slats at right angles to the backboard, so that the three different images are formed when the viewer stands to the left of the painting, the right of the painting and straight on. This style of artwork is known as ananamorphicpainting (sometimes called a ‘turning’ painting) and is probably most familiar to us from one of the most famous works from the National Gallery in London,The Ambassadors by Hans Holbein:

Many a visitor to the National Gallery has stood at the right edge of this painting, so that the anamorphic skull at the bottom of the painting comes into focus:

HistorianStuart Clark's work helps situate anamorphic paintings in the wider visual culture of the Early Modern period. Clarke’sVanities of the Eye: Vision in Early Modern European Cultureplaces anamorphic art into wider debates concerning wonder, astonishment and objectivity in this period. Clark also considers if anamorphic paintings were particularly suited to communicate religious themes. He quotes the 17th-century French theologian Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet who said that “anamorphic images were the perfect natural emblems of a world whose justice, hidden behind appearances, was impossible to see except from ‘a certain point’ revealed by faith in Christ”.

Finding a place to lay your head

Making a house a home

Taking your home wherever you go

How people who have migrated think about home

Home is where we are safe. Home is where our loved ones are. When that becomes unsafe, is it still home?

If we move away from our loved ones, where is home then? How long does it take create a new home when you move away from your roots? Is anywhere else really ever home? Or is home wherever you lay your hat? For people migrating to new countries, home is something that is often negotiated on a daily basis.

When moving to a new land, many people who are migrating - whether through choice or circumstance - often begin their lives in their new countries in temporary accommodation. Once the journey is made, the next step is to find somewhere to live, to search for a new home.

Since 2018, we've hostedEuropeana Migration collection dayswhere we invited people to share their migration stories. The place we call home is a very important theme which recurs throughout many of the stories.

This blog looks at how and why people have chosen or had restrictions on where they could live, and how people make themselves feel at home when in a new country.

Where we live is something many of us take for granted, but for people migrating to new countries, it's something to negotiate on a daily basis. It's a topic that comes up in stories from the present day as well as the past.

Some migrant communities find ways to build their own new homes.

The'Geelongskis'are a Ukrainian community in Geelong, Australia. In their histories, gathered by Dr Natalie Senjov-Makohon, we hear from several families who built their own wooden homes when settling in the city in the mid-20th century.

Building materials like cement, wood and nails were not readily available at the time. As many of the community were employed by a Ford Australia factory, they were able to bring wood from the car packaging crates which they broke up and used to build houses.

This photograph of Peter and Katerina Senjov's first home is one such house. Although basic, they had a roof over their heads with walls, albeit with no plaster on the walls.

As Katerina recalls,'we didn’t care; this was ours and we had our own freedom'.

In Dublin, at our collection day atEPIC The Irish Emigration Museum,Anntold us about moving from Ireland to London in the 1950s.

Moving to the UK in search of work, she arrived there and found it hard to find a place to live.

'My father had a friend who was supposed to put us up, but that didn't work out and so we got a room. It was a tiny little room with no cooking facilities, a small fireplace, and we had to share a bed. It was hard to get a room in London - 'No Blacks, no Irish, no dogs' was the sign in the windows.'

Similar housing problems abound in Dublin today.

Robson, living in Dublin, is part of the growing Brazilian community in Ireland. He tells us about his bedroom, which, due to high rent prices, he has to share with three other people.

'Sharing a room with 4 people is not so good. It's not a big house, we don't have privacy. We want our space and it's really bad. Everyone works and studies at different times, so it's complicated.'

This story, Robson says, is very common for non-European foreigners living in Ireland.

A home is more than four walls and a roof - what do people do to remind them of home, to feel at home?

Simina tells us that she moved from Romania to Brussels, and how a traditional home decoration from Romania made her feel at home.

'I remember walking around my new big, already furnished house in Brussels, trying to make it feel like home. I was failing. And then I put the macrame on a cupboard and there it was: HOME!'

Michel escaped from the recent conflict in Syria in 2014 and undertook a treacherous journey, eventually living in the Netherlands. He told us that once he was more settled in Amsterdam, he asked his mother to send him some objects from home, to remind him of his good memories.

'Shisha for us is about time spent with family and friends. We invite them, the shisha brings us all together. We connect shisha with talking, fun, love, being gezellig, as the Dutch say. If there is no shisha, we feel bored.I still miss a lot from Syria ... sometimes it's very small things I miss: the steps I used to sit on with friends, shisha, cafes I used to visit, the jasmine trees in the garden that I sat under every morning.'

Fernando spoke about a large collage of photographs his friends made when he and his wife were moving from Spain to the Netherlands.

The photographs show parties, holidays, celebrations with messages and dedications written on the back. It's now proudly displayed in Fernando's home in the Netherlands, a reminder of another home, of friendship, of good times.

In Fernando's story, we can see how our homes connect us with our communities and remind us of the people that mean the most to us. In that way, for some people, home is a relative concept. Home is where the heart is, as the well-known saying goes.

AsChristells us in his story, for him, home moves with him.

'Wherever I live, I tend to put my roots down ... I'm a homebody. Because I'm an air-force brat, moving around when I was young, I have no strong feeling of a home. Home is where I am at the moment. For me, home isn't a place to go. It's being surrounded by the ones you love. Home is family. Your true family. Even if they don't share the same blood. My home is where people I care about are; wherever those people are.'

Children's Education: a Point of Contention between Catholics and Protestants

Invaluable Sources for Linguists

An Instructor's Book or a Primer?

An Apparent Increase in Production

For Protestant and Catholic communities of the past, learning the basics of faith and the basics of reading went quite naturally hand in hand. But were all early catechisms necessarily intended as reading primers?

For Europeans at the start of the Early Modern Period, knowledge of Christian doctrines was essential.

When the time came to learn to read, it was only natural to begin with prayers or basic religious instruction. With the development of the printing press, small booklets mixing alphabets, syllabaries and prayers became popular throughout Europe.

In 1529, the publication ofMartin Luther's ‘Small Catechism’ marked the official birth of a format that would have a bright future: a text organised as a series of questions and answers. After a period of hesitation, Catholics took up the practice of using a catechism as well.

The goal was to teach all Christians, even the most humble, whenever possible in their native languages.

This explains why some of the earliest texts in many European languages are catechisms. For example, thefirst book printed in Lithuanian was a catechismpublished in 1547 in Königsberg (modern-day Kaliningrad, Russia). Scholars in the 19th century sought out these modest-looking books with great enthusiasm.

Alphabet books containing prayers were quite clearly meant to be placed in a child's hands, but the role of catechisms themselves in learning to read is open to discussion.

In Catholic countries, bishops had made a point of publishing their own catechisms since the 17th century, sometimes drawing on earlier versions that had proven effective and adapting them to local circumstances. These were instructor's books first and foremost, and they reflect the oral nature of teaching. They also contain many practical tips on how to teach.

Jean De La Noë-Mesnard, author of this catechism that was first printed in 1689, recommends using a long rod 'to admonish the children seated farthest away but not to strike them' with it!

The picture is different for Protestants, among whom religious education more often took place in a family setting.

There are many examples of catechisms that include alphabets and syllabaries, a sign of greater familiarity with books, such as thissyllabary in Icelandic that was printed together with Luther's ‘Small Catechism'in 1695. They show the concern with personally appropriating the doctrines of the faith usually associated with the Reformation.

From the beginning of the 19th century until the time when religion became less prominent in primary education, a wide variety of booklets were produced that included a mix of alphabets, syllabaries, prayers and catechisms.

Should this be seen as a consequence of progress in education? It's best to be cautious in drawing conclusions.

In reality, this impression of increasing production is partly an illusion. Many booklets published in the early centuries of the printing press were fragile and neglected, and have since been lost. This is not the case with more scholarly books, such as theRoman Catechism(1566) or, to give a Protestant example, theHeidelberg Catechism(1563), of which many copies can still be found in European libraries today.

How fashion has shaped European identities

For the #SalonEuropa blog parade, the curatorial team atEuropean Fashion Heritage Associationlooks at how fashion plates have created and imagined European national identities.Fashion objects can tell us many stories - the social histories of their origin and use, how we portray our identities through clothing, how we form communities around fashion and how clothes play a role in our relationships with our bodies.

European archives preserve a large number of objects with diverse origins, both from within Europe and beyond. Fashion objects such as these can illustrate how national identities are  formed. This blog will look at fashion plates. Fashion plates are pictures - usually illustrations - typically published in magazines at least from the 18th century onwards, illustrating fashionable styles in clothes and accessories. Very often they were used to describe fashion of a specific place or nation - for example, Paris, London, or more generally French fashion, and were the most common method to disseminate information about new fashions. So, plates travelled and were mainly used as a way of showing fashions across the borders of different nations. Some nations’ fashion was valued over other’s; desire was created for some things over others. Describing national trends, these plates also reflected on the differences between nations through the ‘look' of their populations.

Courtesy Kunstbibliothek, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, CC BY NC SA These images tell many stories: they are informative and funny at the same time, and can be used to understand social groups through the ways that national design traditions and clothing practices are described.Johann Martin Will, Modethorheit: Les Dames vivent en Paris, 1775-1776. Courtesy Kunstbibliothek, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, CC BY NC SA The differences in style depicted by fashion plates was also exaggerated in satirical prints and caricatures, which were published in popular magazines and newspapers. These prints used fashion as main indicator of the similarities and dissimilarities between peoples and nations, focusing on what was considered ’strange’ and not immediately understandable to construct national stereotypes. The images selected to illustrate this post show an array of different illustrations, both fashion plates and satirical prints, that show how fashion was indeed considered a clear language to demonstrate the difference in tastes and customs of, say, English and French people: this is particularly clear in the caricatures by Samuel William Fores and William Heath. Other artists looked out from the spaces that were considered the centres of fashion and depicted other peoples, such as François Nicolas Martinet who illustrated Russian Costumes in 1814.François Nicolas Martinet, Russian Costumes, 1814. Courtesy Kunstbibliothek, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, CC BY NC SA All in all, apart from the differences in style, these images are able to relate to their historical time and signal alliances and oppositions that are mirrored in the political and social scene of the Europe asset of the time they belong to - and are therefore a fundamental material to look at to better understand our common past.Explore more fashion plates on Europeana Fashion.

Millions of postcards influenced public opinion during the First World War

Millions of postcards circulated during the First World War and influenced public opinion. It is not surprising that something as ordinary as a postcard was used by governments on all sides to either defend their own actions, to discredit the enemy and to rouse the masses to support their nation.  Within just three days of the declaration of war on 1 August 1914, publishers had war-themed postcards on sale. Their powerful images had an unprecedented impact on the masses: The postcard became a weapon of propaganda.

During WWI, propaganda became, for the first time, the responsibility of government agencies like the Ministry of Information in Great Britain. Postcards were cheap to produce, cheap to buy and cheap to send. This made it possible to produce and distribute propaganda on a large scale. Although propaganda was still in its infancy, governments systematically influenced public opinion both at home and abroad. World War I propaganda postcards can be divided into two categories:1. Positive PropagandaThe images portrayed the positive aspects of war. They supported the war effort, showed brave, dependable and modest soldiers on the front, and the peaceful and virtuous families back in the homeland. They evoked sympathy for the cause of the war and sought to make it appear less gruesome. Patriotism and nationalism were used to further political agendas.

2. Negative PropagandaThe images were used to dehumanize the enemy and to stir up hatred against them. The opposing nations were made out to be a formidable opponent - but not to an extent that would induce fear. The enemy was portrayed as menacing and murderous as well as weak and incapable.

Of course, postcards were also used as a simple means of communication. But was it that simple? During WWI, letters and postcards were the only significant means of communication connecting the military front and the home front. Although both the soldiers and their families much preferred letters,  many soldiers were unable to write home frequently. The postcard, being economic and compact, was very popular. It offered both the soldiers and their families some solace and reassurance of their love and well-being. Official field postcards were cheaply made, distributed for free and easy to fill out. But was it that simple? They were in fact unpopular as they were impersonal and uninformative. Moreover, they had no space for expressing worries or fears, and in this sense the soldiers’ communication from the front was censored.

Embroidered postcards on the other hand were difficult and expensive to get, but due to the careful hand-embroidery, they were very popular among soldiers who sent them home as keepsakes.

Finally, there were commercial picture postcards. These were inexpensive and offered illustrations which suited all tastes and occasions. They were in very high demand.

Images of women were not at all uncommon on postcards. They were either depicted as strong symbols of the nation offering good luck, as vulnerable damsels in need of protection, or as saving angels.

The images were meant to encourage soldiers to live up to the expectations of the nation, and to reassure the women waiting for them to return from a successful war.

The outbreak of  World War I was met with excitement on all sides, but the terrible reality of war and its casualties greatly changed people's perception. As a result, in the Second World War new propaganda strategies and techniques had to be implemented to influence the masses. The end of WW I also signified the end of WWI-style war propaganda postcards. To view more postcards, check outour galleryor exploreEuropeana 1914 - 1918.

King Arthur: a Legendary Figure

Arthur’s Knights, Merlin and Magic

Translations

A Model Society

Foundation for a common history in Europe

No literary figure has stood the test of time quite likeKing Arthur. His story has inspired people across Europe for centuries.

The earliest reference to Arthur can be found in ‘The Book of Aneirin’. Originally composed in the 6th century,Aneirin’s poem ‘Y Gododdin’ discusses the battle of Catraeth between the Celtic Britons and the Saxons. However brave the Briton heroes, they were ‘no Arthur’ in Aneirin’s eyes. Here, Arthur is remembered as a royal Celtic warrior, who fiercely fought the Saxons a century earlier.

Geoffrey of Monmouth's ‘Historia Regum Britanniae’ (‘History of the Kings of Britain’), written around 1136, contains one of the earliest accounts of King Arthur's life from his extraordinary birth to his wars and conquests, and his triumph over the Romans. It ends with the battle at Camlann where Arthur is mortally wounded and taken to Avalon, never to be seen again.

Around 1155,Waceadapted the ‘Historia Regum Britanniae’ into the French ‘Roman de Brut’. Arthur becomes the ultimate symbol of strength and glory through his triumphs. Wace was the first to mention the Round Table: to him, it represented a model of ideal society.

A generation later, between 1170 and 1190,Chrétien de Troyeswrote several Arthurian romances in French. He glorified Arthur’s knights, including Lancelot, Percival and Ywain, incorporating them into a fictional universe full of elements from earlier traditions.

Merlin uses magic to arrange Arthur’s conception: he disguises Uther Pendragon, Arthur’s father, so that he can spend the night with Igraine at Tintagel.Robert de Boron, 'Histoire de Merlin'. Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, MSS Français 95, f. 149v, No Copyright – Other Known Legal Restrictions

In the 13th century,Robert de Boronrefocused the legends on Merlin and his magical gifts, giving him a more central role. Merlin becomes instrumental in ensuring Arthur’s birth, crowning him king and establishing the Round Table.

In the late-12th - early-13th centuries, the legend of King Arthur took another step east. Chrétien de Troyes’s stories were translated in Germany: -Hartmann von Aue’s ‘Erec’ and ‘Iwein’ -Wolfram von Eschenbach’s version of the Holy Grail story, ‘Parzival’ At the same time, it crossed the Alps. Old French manuscripts circulated in Italy and inspired authors likeRustichello da Pisa, who wrote a compilation of Arthurian material.

Rustichello da Pisa's 'Compilation' is an adaptation of the 'Palamedes' romance, composed in French. It was later divided into two parts: 'Meliadus de Leonnoys' and 'Guiron (or Giron) le Courtois'.Rustichello da Pisa, 'Roman de Giron le courtois' (frag.). Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, MSS NAF 5243, f. 22,No Copyright – Other Known Legal Restrictions

Several translations were also produced in the 14th century: the ‘Estoire del Saint Graal’, the ‘Queste’ and the ‘Mort Artu’. You can also read an Italian translation of ‘Lancelot’, but unfortunately the only surviving manuscript is incomplete. The most famous Italian writersDante,PetrarcaandBoccaccioand painters such asPisanelloknew those texts very well, as they mention andportrayArthur and his knights in their works.

The Arthurian literary traditions promoted the code of chivalry throughout Europe, turning Arthur into an emblematic European hero. With the Round Table, King Arthur sets the standard for a government where all the knights are equals. This lays the founding principles for a European model of government: - the noble deeds of the knights and the equality between them appealed to the medieval nobility - the emblematic king embodied the ideal of good government - the supernatural elements supported the idea that God approved of the monarchy and the chivalric code

To our modern eyes, the Round Table may appear as an early attempt at democracy, despite being restricted to a small elite.‘Lancelot en prose’ (vol. IV). Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, MSS Français 116, f. 610v, No Copyright – Other Known Legal Restrictions

In 15th-century England,Thomas Malorycompiled and translated the major French novels in ‘Le Morte d’Arthur’. He refers to “the once and the future king”, implying that Arthur may one day return to rule again. Calling on Arthur’s authority and possible return, at a time when factions of the English royal family fought for the crown, meant pleading for peace, for a return to a glorious past.

Migration and making a new life in Europe

Europeana Migrationbrings together digital collections dedicated to the theme of migration to, from and within Europe, sourced from both cultural heritage institutions and the public.

When Museum Burg Posterstein invited us to take part in their blog parade#SalonEuropa, which asks writers to consider what Europe means to them, the obvious thing to do was to see what Europe means to the people who have shared their stories of making new lives here. Let's take a look...

'I brought today my European Health Card. This illustrates my sense of being European, of the blurring of borders and feeling safe wherever I am. All of Europe is my country, and that is kind of amazing when I think about it.'

Read 'Lifelong migrant | Anne'



'There was a very complex situation in all of Europe when I arrived: terrorist threats, rising xenophobia and nationalism. This was particularly seen in Poland. In a smaller city, like Łódź, you can feel more directly the nationalism and conservative ideas. 'In the university, I took courses with Polish students. Often I was the only foreigner in the course; the Polish students would sitting separately from me. 'In supermarkets and train stations, it was hard for all the foreigners. Some experienced discrimination a lot. One of my friends was hit by someone in a nightclub.'

Read 'How it was challenging to study in Łódź | José'



'I found a job, worked hard and used my EU Freedom of Movement to find somewhere I could bear to live. My retirement was well organised: from the warmer countries in the EU, the obvious choice was Spain, because I already spoke Spanish. The warmest part is the Canary Islands. I had spent a winter there and loved it.'

Read 'From a Serial Migrant | Elisa'



'And I was lucky to see a lot of Europe. I travelled to almost 30 countries - all in the space of 6 months! I think I actually only stayed three weekends in Łódź, the rest I travelled. I tried to travel with people linked to those places: like going to Romania with a Romanian friend. I tried to prioritise parts of Europe in the east, with hard histories: the Balkans, the Baltics.'

Read 'How it was amazing to study in Łódź | José'



_'I love being somewhere where you can be somewhere else in an hour. In Australia, you travel an hour from Melbourne and you're still in Melbourne. Here I could be in Poland in an hour or Lithuania and there's so many more cultures to explore within easy reach. Maybe people in Europe take this for granted.'

Read 'The only Australian in Ireland | Chris'

'Diana dreamed that Europeans could have equal rights all over Europe. But the reality was different. The 'Wall' came down in 1989 but the division between East and West was still present on our continent. 'From 1999 to 2007 (when Romania joined the EU), it was a time full of struggle for Diana. Finally she received annual work permits and was able to make a living in Belgium. Her parents were sad and lonely in Romania. Her father never came to Brussels to visit Diana. He died 5 months before I was born.'

Read'Dreams of Freedom | Diana'



'I am Spanish and I was in Holland when the anti-austerity movement known as 15M emerged in Spain. 'I lived it with great intensity and I got involved in the movement with other Spaniards from Holland. This allowed us to give visibility to what was happening in Spain and to try to get the Dutch to join our anti-austerity demands.'

Read 'Expandiendo el 'Spanish revolution' | Sol'



'I'm a big techno fan. Wherever I go - England, Spain, Italy - techno is with me, it's my European heritage. Here, I discovered different techno music. I go to different festivals where I can discover new music. Techno is part of my movement around Europe - wherever I go I ask 'where is the techno club?' 'It's easy to move around in Europe and techno is part of that. I was listening to this music today. Music is what I bring wherever I travel.'

In January 2014, during our second series ofEuropeana 1914-1918collection days in Berlin, a very special and unique contribution to our project was made:the richly-illustrated manuscriptproduced by German prisoner of war (POW) Ernst Kleiber, while he was in Russian custody in Central Asia.

Page from Kleiber's manuscript, Europeana 1914-1918, CC0

Although he was eventually released in April 1918, Kleiber unfortunately never made it back home.

His manuscript, however, returned in safe hands to his family, who ever since have sought to publish it. In 1927, Prague zoologist, Prof. Dr. Ludwig Freund, attested to the scientific value of Kleiber's manuscript but was unable to provide the necessary funds to publish it.

Each document records in meticulous, scientific detail Kleiber's findings on the flora and fauna of Turkestan, the region where he was held captive. His written notes are accompanied by detailed sketches of his surroundings and illustrations of species of flora and fauna he describes in themanuscript.

Ernst Kleiber (on the right) standing next to an unidentified soldier, Europeana 1914-1918, CC0

Ernst Kleiber was born on 15 December 1886 in Budweis, now České Budějovice in Czechia.

On June 25, 1904, he completed his school education and studied at the Technical University in Prague. He finished his studies there on 15 December 1911. By March 1912, the engineer was called to join the technical service at the postal administration in Linz (Lower Austria). He began his service on March 30, 1912.

In August 1914 he was 'taken in', that is to say, he entered the standing army, and subsequently became an officer (fortification construction) of the K. u. k. Directorate General of the Przemyśl Fortress in Galicia.

On one of the firstpostcardsafter his capture as a prisoner in April 1915 sent from Penza in Russia, Ernst writes to his mother: "Dear Mother, I send my warmest greetings to all the loved ones from Penza as I travel to the Far East”.

Kleiber was taken into Russian captivity in February 1915 during the Russian winter offensive at Przemyśl and was transferred to the Orenburg-Tashkent railway from Orenburg (Оренбург / Russia) to the POW camp Perowsk in Russian Turkestan (Қызылорда / Kysylorda / Kazakhstan) and in October 1916 via Andijan (Andijon / Uzbekistan) moved to the camp in Osh, Fergana region in Russian Turkestan (Kyrgyzstan).

It was during his imprisonment that Kleiber drew an extensive work on the flora and fauna of Turkestan. You can appreciate a selection of his drawings inour gallery "Beetles and Butterflies".

He was released from captivity in April, but never returned home. On November 23, 1918, his mother received her son's last message: a postcard dated April 26, 1918 in which he expressed his anticipation of a speedy reunion. Since then, Ernst Kleiber has been officially considered missing.

The manuscript of his workThe Nature of Turkestan(96 pages manuscript, 43 plates) reached his mother via detours. She tried to publish it in the 1920s, but without success.

It was marked by experts such as Prof. Friedrich Blumentritt, Budweis, and zoologist Prof. Dr. med. Ludwig Freund, Prague, as extremely valuable and that it should necessarily be secured in a public institution, until the funds for a publication could be found.

We invite people to work on the transcription and annotation of this very important work with the help of our online transcription tool Transcribathon -learn moreabout this initiative and our project. Eventually, we hope that Ernst Kleiber's manuscript would become a printed publication.

The Story of the Rose

The ‘Romance of the Rose’, a medieval French poem that takes the form of an allegorical dream vision, was written by two successive authors:Guillaume de Lorrisin the late 1230s, andJean de Meun, who completed it almost forty years later. The authors’ purpose is to both entertain and teach others about the art of courtly love, as a part of the tradition of the "art of love" inspired byOvid.

The poem tells of the Lover’s quest for the Rose, representing his lady, from love at first sight to the deflowering of the beloved. The earlier part of the ‘Rose’ belongs to the tradition of thefin'amorof troubadours and the romantic epic. In the later part, Jean de Meun replaces Guillaume de Lorris's poetry with a summary of university culture and a more cynical vision of love. At the end, the ‘Romance of the Rose’ concludes in favour of the forces of nature, ignoring the tensions specific to courtly love, the moral obligations of marriage and the teachings of the Church.

The ‘Rose’ became the most popular work in the Old French vernacular. Some 250 medieval manuscripts are still extant. It had a strong influence on literature in France and beyond. Around 1290,Gui de Morirewrote the ‘Rose’ from a Christian point of view.Guillaume de Digullevillealso composed an allegorical work around 1330-1331, the ‘Pèlerinage de vie humaine’. Using the codes of the ‘Rose’, he invites his readers on a quest of spiritual rather than amorous initiation.

The poem was also the subject of two moralisations: around 1400,Evrart de Conty, in the ‘Livre des Echecs amoureux’ (‘Book of Love Chess’), transposed in a didactic commentary the stages of amorous conquest into an allegorical game of chess. Later, around 1500,Jean de Molinetrewrote the ‘Romance of the Rose’ in prose and gave it spiritual significance.

Echoes of the ‘Romance of the Rose’ were heard beyond the French language, especially through great European poets. The most relevant Italian translation is the poem ‘Il Fiore’ (‘The Flower’), attributed toDante. The hypothesis of Dante’s authorship is supported by the explicit naming of the poem’s author,Durante(the full form of Dante), and by the mention of the assassination ofSiger of Brabant, an Averroist scholar at the Sorbonne who was murdered in Paris.

This episode is cited by only one other source, Dante’s ‘Paradise’. The poem is composed of 232 sonnets functionally linked to one another, representing one of the first examples of this kind of poetic structure. It is just called ‘Flower’, since the text never explicitly mentions a rose, but every time Dante mentions the ‘Romance of the Rose’ in the ‘Comedy’, the quotation seems to depend on the translation of the French poem already given in the ‘Fiore’.Geoffrey Chaucer, the author of the ‘Canterbury Tales’, translated the poem into English from the original Old French. Critics have suggested that the character of La Vieille acted as source material for Chaucer's Wife of Bath, who claims the same lust for life.

At the beginning of the 15th century, the ‘Romance of the Rose’ sparked the first French literary quarrel betweenJean Gerson,Christine de Pizanand other writers and moralists.

The boundaries between the permitted and the banned were sometimes very thin and unpredictable. Erasmus of Rotterdam’s popular collection of proverbs, theAdagia, was banned together with his entire opus, only because he did not take a sufficiently critical stance against the Protestant Reformation. Though exorcism was an acknowledged method of casting out demons and the devil, popular exorcism manuals likeFlagellum daemonumbyGirolamo Menghiwere banned because they contained rites which were not compliant with the official Church liturgy. Though widely popular, Machiavelli’s political works were banned because they dealt with politics outside of the Church’s authority. Montesquieu’s proposal to divide political power into legislative, executive, and judicial in hisDe l'esprit des loiswas considered to be politically subversive at the time. But it had a strong impact on numerous state and political regulations, and constitutional acts.

Baldassare Castiglione’sIl Cortegianowas the central reference work for aristocratic courtly etiquette throughout Europe. It was put on theIndexbecause of its satirical comments and jokes at the Church’s expense. In order to prevent further opposition to the geocentric worldview, Nicolaus Copernicus’sDe revolutionibus orbium coelestiumwas put on theIndexin 1616. This was more than seventy years after it was first published!

A Legacy of Love...

...of an Exceptional Couple

What led to the most famous medieval correspondence? A thwarted love affair!

The passionate relationship betweenAbelard and Heloisein 12th-century France was well known even in the Middle Ages and has remained popular ever since.

The scholastic philosopher and theologianPeter Abelard, described byPeter the Venerableas 'the Socrates of France, the sublime Plato of the West, our Aristotle', was as brilliant as he was controversial.

His thought and works on morality, theology anddialecticwere of great importance. Besides these contributions, he is also remembered as the castrated lover ofHeloise d'Argenteuil.

The story of their passion has made Heloise and Abelard one of the great couples of legend: their correspondence was quoted as early as the 13th century byJean de Meunin theRomance of the Rose,andFrançois Villonmentioned it in 1461 in hisBallade des dames du temps jadis, which wasset to music in 1953byGeorges Brassens.

François Villon, 'Ballade des dames du temps jadis', 1461, Bibliothèque nationale de France,No Copyright - Other Known Legal Restrictions

In Modern French, the poem reads: 'Où est la très sage Héloïs, Pour qui fut châtré et puis moine Pierre Esbaillart à Saint-Denis ? Pour son amour eut cette peine.' Villon's poem was translated into English in 1870 byDante Gabriel RossettiasThe Ballad of Dead Ladies:

Where's Heloise, the learned nun, For whose sake Abeillard, I ween, Lost manhood and put priesthood on? (From Love he won such dule and teen!)

Their story tells of the love that grew between one of the greatest minds of the early 12th century, then 40 years old, and his brilliant 18-year-old student.

The affair led to their secret marriage and the birth of their son, Astrolabe. However, it also caused conflict with Heloise's family and resulted in Fulbert, a powerful canon in Paris, giving the order for Abelard to be castrated as punishment.

TheLetters of Two Lovers(Epistolae duorum amantium) were discovered in the 15th century, but lay forgotten until the 20th century.

Some scholars have recently attributed them to Heloise and Abelard, believing these letters could be the passionate correspondence of their youth. Better known are theletters translated by Bussy-Rabutinin the 17th century. These were exchanged after the lovers’ forced separation and their later entry into religious life, when Heloise was abbess of the Paraclete and Abelard a monk in Saint-Denis.

The oldest letter from Heloise to Abelard in this collection was written nearly 20 years after she entered the convent.

She seeks to resume their past relationship while at the same time encouraging him to focus on faith and religion. In this exchange, where Heloise truly exists as Abelard's lover and wife in only five letters that have been preserved, the former lovers discuss Benedictine rule and Heloise in particular provides a critical reflection on monastic life.

To continue celebrating a love story that took place a thousand years ago, why not visit the tomb where Heloise and Abelard have been reunited, finally and forever, in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris?

Textual networks

Travelling texts: from Paris to Moscow

The invention of printing in the middle of the 15th century gave rise to the cross-cultural flow of texts throughout Europe. But complex webs of connections also developed later. The 18th century Italian printer and publisher Remondini and its pedlars is a brilliant example.

Remondini world map- Mappe Monde ou description du globe terrestre : assujettie aux observations astronomiques, Janvier,  Biblioteca de Catalunya, public domain

From the beginning of the 18th century Remondini from Bassano del Grappa flooded Europe with millions of prints. Remondini’s product range was among the broadest in Europe.

They were managing all the stages of book creation: production and sale (engraving school operating at Bassano), relations with contemporary artists, the manufacture of paper in their own paper mills, a large number of printing presses, close commercial relations with merchants located in Europe.

The widespread distribution of their texts was carried out by thousands ofpedlarswho originated from the Tesino and theNatisonevalleys. With several centuries’ tradition in trading with other European countries behind them, they spoke several languages.

These pedlars became part of a well-organised network for the distribution of popular print. Groups were frequently made up of members of one family, which guaranteed solidarity and reciprocal trust in work full of uncertainties. They left their home villages during the second half of August and returned for the labour in spring. Their business was based on periodic visits, their good name and friendly relations with potential customers.

The pedlars always travelled on foot. They had to carry everything that they might need with them.

Usually printed texts were sent forward by other means. The Sava, Drava, Danube and Tibisco rivers formed the spines of their routes, which crossed Carniola, Carinthia, Styria, Hungary, Croatia, and Transylvania.

The pedlars visited cities from Paris to London, from Augsburg to Amsterdam, and from Vienna to Moscow. Recent research by Alberto Milano concluded that in 1781 at least 1000 people in Tesino and Natisone were directly involved in the travelling trade in prints.

In 1846, Tesino traders had shops in Paris, Strasbourg, Bern, Brussels, Antwerp, Amsterdam, Augsburg, Hamburg, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Warsaw, Lviv, Saint Petersburg and Moscow.

In the 19th century, significant changes in buying habits and an increase in sales transformed the Tesino pedlars into merchants.

Primary sources of Italian history

If you want to know what was it like to live in the Florence of 1400, to discover how the monks of Novacella Monastery begun to produce wine or to trace the development of a public institution, you’ve got togo back to their documents. Texts like chronicles, memories and biographies as well as statutes, inventories, sales contracts represent the so-calledprimary sourcesand provide a wealth of information about the events and the life of a place in time.

To help us in this search, we can now take advantage of the huge collection of work done by scholars in 18th and 19th centuries: learned men who gathered, edited and published all the primary sources they could find. Such efforts led to a new approach to the study of history based on primary sources. In Italy, the main actor in 1700 wasLodovico Muratori.

Portrait of Antonio Lodovico Muratori, 1800 - 1899, Rijksmuseum, public domain

Born in 1672,Muratoriwas a clergyman with degrees in Philosophy and Law. He was employed by the Estensi Family, Dukes of Modena, as librarian and archivist with the special duty of finding useful documents to justify the territorial expansion of the family. This research gave Muratori the inspiration to widen this perspective - developing the attempts made more than one century before by Machiavelli and Guicciardini - of establishing a systematic approach towards the collection of documents supporting historiography that eventually led to the birth of National Histories, such as theMonumenta Germaniae Historicain Germany. His firstmasterpiecewas theRerum Italicarum Scriptores:a publication of 25 volumes which portrayed the history of Italy through its chronicles. The publication was sustained by the fundraising of a dedicated society. Here we find the major historians of medieval Italy likeGiovanni Villani, author of theHistoria UniversalisandDino Compagni, as well as less known or even anonymous texts, that often are the only sources to trace the past of a territory.

Muratori was a tireless man. As soon as he had completed that work in 1738, he started theAntiquitates Italicae Medii Aevi, another huge collection of primary sources showing thecustoms and practices of Medieval Italy:- its institutions - the role of women - the development of its language - the rules of justice - everyday things like clothing, jobs, markets, sports. Thanks to Muratori, we can now easily read thousands of documents from the 5th to the 15th centuries, preserved in public and ecclesiastical archives spread throughout Italy. And all that without having to decipher handwritten personal writings!

On Europeana, you can find other precious primary sources for Italian history (as well as for other Countries), not included in Muratori’s work, edited by other erudites such asAntonio Caracciolo(XVI cent.),Giovanni Battista Caruso(XVII-XVIII cent.),Antonio Chiusole(XVII-XVIII cent.),Stefano Borgia(XVIII cent.),Lorenzo Giustiniani(XVIII cent.) and many more.

How culture evolves to become richer from the joining of cultural tapestries

Community is defined by the Oxford Dictionary as: ‘a group of people living in the same place or having a particular characteristic in common’.

But what happens when you don’t have anything in common with those you live with? Does your identity change in line with the community - or do you change the community?

In collecting stories about migration, the concept of community was continually raised. In this current political climate, integrating as a migrant into a new society sometimes gets confused with assimilation. We often focus on how must change and adapt to our new surrounds.

However, little focus is placed on how we change it; how we contribute to it, and how culture evolves to become richer from the joining of these cultural tapestries.

Two twigsexemplifies this ideology. The group pictured are a Ukrainian dance group who emigrated through Germany and Italy after they became displaced after World War II and the political unrest in the former Soviet-Yugoslavia.

The reference to ‘Two twigs’ relates to the two differing migration journeys of the group, which both ended with the community settling in Geelong, Victoria Australia. While their stories of migration were the result of displacement and the very loss of national homeland and community, their outcome was one of cultural sharing.

The image illustrates this - it doesn’t focus on how the group were changed by migration - it shows how their migration changed the community.

Just as we shared the story ofBalbino Cuervowho helped developed Spanish communities and schools in the Netherlands, those who emigrated from Ukraine were able to bring their culture and traditions to Australia - adding diversity and richness.

Sharing culture through dance

Many countries have historically welcomed a diversity of culture - even if recent political decisions may insist otherwise.Carnaval del Pueblo in south Londonshows a moment of community through cultural sharing.

The attached the photograph illustrates the impact of the Latin American community on a south London neighbourhood.

The contributor highlights that the area hosts a Latin American carnival local sporting events. The story really illustrates the intermingling of many cultures - the typically London pub the ‘Elephant and Castle’ hosting the community of Colombian and Greek football fans and Latin American carnival goers.

‘There was a real family vibe, with all ages from grandparents to babies. There was a great atmosphere, people taking mass photos of the whole crowd, chanting songs, doing Mexican waves and flinging popcorn around.’

It is important to remember that stories of migration should not only focus on what the person migrating is receiving, or how they are changing. We should remember too what they are offering and what they are sharing. Herein lies the beauty of community building in stories of migration. Migration has mutual, positive effects on individuals and communities.

This theme has weaved its way through theMigration Collectionand the many of the works showcased onEuropeana Collections.

News is news, whether it appears in tabloids, broadsheets, newsbooks

News is news, whether it appears in tabloids, broadsheets, newsbooks or the popular Berliner format. The reader is supposed to focus on the content and not the format. Nonetheless, each format was created with a specific intention and they have all influenced the newspapers we recognize today. Many historians agree that the world’s first newspaper was the GermanRelation aller Fürnemmen und gedenckwürdigen Historien (Account of all distinguished and commemorable news). This looks more like a “newsbook” than the newspapers we are familiar with today.



Relation aller Fürnemmen und gedenckwürdigen Historien, 1609, Universitätsbibliothek Heidelberg, CC BY-SA

The first broadsheet newspaper is said to be theDutch Courante uyt Italien, Duytslandt, &c., published in 1618. Broadsheet, or broadside, refers both to the format and the type of print: a sheet of paper printed on one side and not folded. The broadsheet was introduced in Britain in 1712 when a tax was placed on newspapers based on the number of pages they had. The British people quickly took to the broadsheet for their political activism as the format lent itself to quick distribution and the printing costs were relatively low.  Originally, broadsheets carried official notices, royal proclamations, public announcements and later ballads and political satire. Nowadays, broadsheets typically focus on in-depth coverage with a serious-minded tone.

Tabloids are generally half the size of broadsheets. Although today “tabloid journalism” often refers to the popular, sensational stories or gossip columns, the tabloid format itself has less of a negative connotation. In the 1880s the London-based companyBurroughs Wellcome & codeveloped compressed tablets they marketed as “Tabloid” pills. The term became synonymous with “compressed” and “effective” and was quickly used to describe other items. The British “Daily Mail” was the first newspaper to become known as a tabloid as it published news in easy to understand and short texts directed toward the working class. The word persisted to describe newspapers printed on smaller sheets and published simplified and easily absorbed stories.

In Berlin, in the early 1900s another small format gained popularity but for different reasons than the tabloid. The Berliner format is slightly larger than a tabloid, but it is onlythree columns across. A broadsheet usually has six columns and a tabloid a maximum of five. There were good reasons for the Berliner format: - German has many long words with more syllables than English.

A typical British newspaper column could only contain three to four German words. Almost every line would have to end with a hyphen which would be visually unappealing. - The ornate German Fraktur font is wider than the commonly used Antiqua. This meant more space would be needed to avoid the letters from being crowded and becoming illegible. The format of a newspaper is no longer as strongly linked to its content as it was in the past. However, our perception of the quality of a newspaper is still strongly influenced by its design.

This period of the summer, when not much is happening in the political sphere, is called the silly season in English. Due to a lack of newsworthy events to report on, the media focus on trivial and frivolous matters and hoax stories, as explained in theBrewer's Dictionary of Phrase & Fable from 1898:

The Silly Season for daily newspapers, is when Parliament is not in session, and all sorts of “silly” stuff are vamped-up for padding. Also called the “Big Gooseberry Season,” because paragraphs are often inserted on this subject.

'Cucumber time' is another name for this time of the year, due to cucumbers being in season during the summer months.

Brewer's Dictionarymakes a connection between cucumber time – when the gentry leaves the city and goes to the countryside to enjoy the summer – and tailors’ difficulties with finding work:

Cucumber time - The dull season in the tailoring trade. The Germans call it Die saure Gurken Zeit (pickled gherkin time). Hence the expression 'Tailors are vegetarians', because they live on 'cucumber' when without work, and on 'cabbage' when in full employ.

The term 'cucumber time' is used in many European languages -komkommertijdin Dutch,agurktidin Norwegian,sezon ogòrkowyin Polish,okurková sezónain Czech,hapukurgihooaegin Estonian anduborkaszezonin Hungarian.

Instead of cucumbers, Swedes have thenyhetstorka(news drought) while the French refer tola morte saison- the dead season.

Luckily there are ways to avoid dull news reports and TV re-runs.

The Index Librorum Prohibitorum

Did you know that the earliest known list of recommended and banned books dates from about 496? It was issued byPope Gelasius I. Printed lists of banned books existed since the beginning of the escalating religious conflicts of the 1520s. They were published in the Dutch Catholic regions (1529), in Venice (1543), and in Paris (1551). The first Roman list was published in 1557 but it was soon withdrawn.

The first official RomanIndexof banned books was published in 1559 underPope Paul IV. It contained approximately 550 religiously, morally and politically controversial authors, as well as individual works.

TheIndexwas often republished as the spread of printing, the development of sciences, and the fast-changing social and political circumstances increased the number of authors and works endangering the religious and the political authorities. The 20th edition of theIndexwas published in 1948, and was ultimately abolished byPope Paul VIin 1966. It coexisted with other censorship lists, like theCatalogus librorum a Commissione aulica prohibitorum, which was published between 1754 and 1780 duringMaria Theresa’srule.

The most dangerous authors on theIndexbelonged to the so-called ‘first class’ of banned authors – that is, the most dangerous.  The most common reason for an author or an individual work to be put on the RomanIndexwas a deviation of his views from the official Catholic Church doctrine. Other reasons were that the authors or their works were considered to be politically subversive, or morally contentious.

Numerous authors resorted to publishing their works under pseudonyms. Printers and the publishers also sometimes disguised their identity, by giving fictitious printing places or printers’ names on title pages. Banned books could be confiscated, and the authors, as well as the booksellers, could be fined or persecuted. There were even a couple of ‘trials and executions’ of banned books, like the public burnings of Helvetius’sDe l'espritin Paris in 1785.

As all banned things only tend to increase the curiosity of the public, no official Church or secular suppression was able to prevent the curious readership from acquiring and reading banned authors and their works. The Church authorities followed the latest heresies, therefore a considerable number of banned books found their way into ecclesiastical libraries. Private book collectors often kept the lists of banned books in order to keep up with the novelties on the book market. Book censorship gave rise to a lively black market for banned literature.

Over a million Belgian refugees and thousands of British soldiers fled to the neutral Netherlands.

Today, the global refugee crisis is a hot topic, all over the news and debated about in society. What is to be changed about the current situation? Who is supposed to do what and when? It may be considered a problem right now, but in fact, Europe faced the same problem with the advent of World War I, more than 100 years ago.

July 1914: World War I started and Europe changed rapidly. Many European countries were invaded by the Germans and there was no stopping it.

Belgium in particular soon became the main battlefield of this war. The fortress of Liege fell rapidly. Under command of the highest naval officer in rank Winston Churchill, Great Britain sent troops to prevent Antwerp from also falling into German hands.

Despite all efforts, Antwerp did not hold up against the enemy. Over a million Belgian refugees and thousands of British soldiers, therefore, fled to the neutral Netherlands. The Belgian exodus was undeniable.

Most of the refugee civilians returned to Belgium after a year.

The militaries who fled their country were interned in Dutch camps. They were to be disarmed immediately. Every measure was taken to prevent further fighting on neutral grounds.

Amongst other cities, the Dutch town of Harderwijk tripled in its number of citizens. 13,000 Belgians were interned in a designated camp where they would stay for the remainder of the war.

In the city of Groningen, the same internment procedure took place for soldiers ofChurchill’s Little Army, who came to save Antwerp earlier.

Daily life in the camps of Harderwijk and Groningen was at first uncomfortable, lacking sufficient health care and circumstances caused much boredom. Yet slowly, situations for the interned soldiers improved. The camps became proper villages, with different types of facilities popping up. In Harderwijk, a hospital, an English style tea-room and a school to battle illiteracy were built.

Church, cinema and theatre were actively visited by residents of both camps. Afritureproviding with French fries was widely enjoyed by the Belgians. Sports events and competitions were held throughout the year, with cycling tournaments and a contest about who could make the best snow sculpture. Even a bear fight, watched by a large audience, took place once, though the exact details remain unknown.

Unskilled labour at nearby farms was eventually allowed as well, some of the internees were even sent to the southern province of Limburg to work in the coal mines.

Missing loved ones was hard for many. A cross-European mail system was soon set up, which enabled the interned to send letters and postcards home. A necessity for most, since relationships with the locals were not always as good as one might hope for.

Today, a hundred years after World War I, the well known or rather much-discussed phenomenon of refugees scattered across Europe shows many similarities to the past.

Will we continue to set borders on our hospitality and give in to fear? Or are we going to care and help these people out of their misery? In the end, we might have more in common than meets the eye. This story is one of many. Certainly not easily talked about and faced with a risk of becoming a victim to collective amnesia.

Nowadays - in hindsight in Belgium, the refugees of Harderwijk are often looked at as deserters, who abandoned their country when situations got tough. In Groningen and Harderwijk, the camps were taken down completely a few years after the war. Other camps remained in place and were used again during World War II.

Lest we forget, a phrase commonly heard in times of commemorating World War I. We surely must not forget what happened on the battlefields and in major geopolitical spheres. When this all ended, however, communities were thoroughly devastated. For them, the war would continue for years to come.

We should continue to tell and remember the personal stories of individuals from these communities.

Emphasizing their thoughts, emotions, day to day activities and heartache into the bigger picture. These people influence greatly our perceptions of long gone times and enable us to see the context. They guide us in our approach to refugees now, because they were in a similar situation then. They shape us in our understanding and help us set sail for the future.

Knowing where we are going, because we know where we come from.

Breastfeeding beyond babies

As long as there have been babies, which is quite a long time, there's been breastfeeding. This week is World Breastfeeding Week – coordinated by the World Alliance for Breastfeeding Action. In this blog, I look at imagery depicting breastfeeding in Europeana.

Nowadays, reports of photos of women breastfeeding their babies getting removed from social media with complaints of indecency are commonplace. And there's not a great deal of coverage (pun intended) in our art heritage either. From the many millions of cultural heritage items on Europeana, a search for 'breastfeeding' (and variants in other languages) returns just a few hundred results. But there are some really lovely images. Take a look.

When required to express breastmilk these days, we use powerful electric pumps and, as adept multi-taskers, well-practised mums can just about manage to do it at the same time as shushing the baby back to sleep and building a Lego tower with their older sibling.

The Science Museum has an example of a breast pump from 1771-1830, which may have been used by a wet nurse. It's made of brass and glass, and I'm sure, if it were in my household, I'd be picking pieces of smashed glass out of the Lego faster than you could say 'pass me the pump'. Another version is made of glass and rubber. And finally, an even older bit of breastfeeding tech – wooden and beeswax nipple shields.

When you're producing food for another human being, what you eat is important too.

Breastfeeding women need about an extra 500 calories a day. Foods like barley and oats are hailed as helping to increase milk production. You can make tasty things out of barley and oats. So spare a thought for nursing women of the past. This is an example of a clay tablet from the Milk Grotto in the holy city of Bethlehem – the site where Christians believe the Virgin Mary stopped to breastfeed Jesus as they fled to Egypt.

It contains a range of essential elements such as potassium, zinc and magnesium, and it's thought that pregnant and nursing women ate these stones in times of famine. I think I'd rather have a flapjack.

For some, whether for personal preference, lack of support or complications that make it difficult, breastfeeding is not the way to go.

Here's an advertisement for an early kind of formula milk called rather unappetisingly 'Lactated Food', which contained wheat, barley, sugar of milk and 'the necessary bone-forming elements' (whatever they are!). From the chubby cheeks and the looks on their faces, it was clearly doing the job for these babies.

Here's one scenario breastfeeding mums might recognise... The Virgin Mary appears to a saint and squirts her milk at him whilst holding the baby Jesus. OK, so we've probably never squirted a saint, but plenty of us have accidentally sprayed someone who wasn't the intended recipient. In one version of this story, the Virgin Mary squirts her milk into St Bernard's eye and it cures an infection.

Sounds far-fetched? Not so much. Breast milk is often used to help soothe conjunctivitis.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life and then supplemented breastfeeding for at least one year and up to two years or more.

But of course, if there is milk available, you don't have to be a child to take it – see the story of St Bernard above. And in these images depicting a story from ancient Rome, Pero breastfeeds her father Cimon to assuage his hunger after he has been imprisoned and sentenced to death by starvation.

1. Yorkshire is the biggest county in England

2. Yorkshire is God's own country

3. Yorkshire won the Wars of the Roses

4. Dracula was from Yorkshire

5. Eating Yorkshire puddings on Sundays is the law

Celebrating Yorkshire Day with five facts about the UK's largest county

Yorkshire Day is celebrated each year on 1 August. Our Yorkshire-resident editor Beth introduces here five totally unbiased facts about Yorkshire: the best place in England!

Except that strictly speaking, Yorkshire isn't a county anymore.

In terms of administration, most of Yorkshire is part of the official 'Yorkshire and the Humber' region, but the very north of the region outlined above is part of 'North East England'. Yorkshire is also divided into four smaller civil administrations all of which used to be called the 'Ridings of Yorkshire'. The East managed to hang on to the 'Riding', but the others are now North, West and South Yorkshire.

In terms of cultural identity, Yorkshire is a region all to itself, which is celebrated each year on 1 August - Yorkshire Day.

Other places might also claim this, but the fact is, God's own country is definitely Yorkshire. It certainly has lots of cathedrals, (ruined) abbeys and churches so God would be very at home here. Here are a few.

Ok, so maybe both teams in the mid-15th century Wars of the Roses came off quite badly as the wars finished off the male lines of both rival parts of the Plantagenet family - the House of York and the House of Lancaster.

The last significant battle was the Battle of Bosworth Field, which was won by the Lancastrians. But, as it's Yorkshire Day, so let's say the Yorkies won.

The title 'Wars of the Roses' refers to the emblems of each family. The House of York was a white rose, and the House of Lancaster a red rose. That symbolism persists 600 years later with everything from community groups to businesses, pubs and shopping centres named after the flowers: white rose for Yorkshire, red rose for Lancashire.

Ok, so maybe he wasn't from Yorkshire, but he certainly lived there for a bit.

If we're being pedantic, in the novel, Bram Stoker's Dracula hails from Transylvania, but after a shipwreck off the coast of Whitby, he came ashore and spent some time doing his vampire thing in the Yorkshire town.

We can say that Dracula got his name from Yorkshire - from the library in Whitby actually.

Author Bram Stoker visited the local library in Whitby whilst on holiday and discovered an account of a 15th-century prince called Vlad Tepes who impaled his enemies on wooden stakes. He was known as Dracula – the 'son of the dragon' or 'the devil' in the Wallachian language (Wallachia is a historical region of Romania).

Well, maybe not the law, but certainly encouraged. A Sunday roast is served in almost all pubs in Yorkshire (if not the UK), with the Yorkshire pudding as the star attraction.

It's related to the pancake in terms of ingredients but despite the word 'pudding', it's part of the main meal, not a dessert. Although originally, it was more of an appetiser.

They are cheap to make and eating them first means you're too full to eat much expensive meat.

Here's the recipe that I use - 3 oz plain flour, 2 eggs, 3 fl oz of milk, 2 fl oz of water, pinch of salt. Whisk these all up to make a smooth batter. Turn the oven on as hot as you dare. Heat vegetable oil in a muffin tray. When hot (smoking is good), pour in the batter, it'll sizzle. Put in the oven and DO NOT OPEN THE DOOR AGAIN UNTIL THEY'RE DONE!

How long they take depends on how much you've put in each hole, how hot your oven is and what else is in there. They'll take between 20-30 minutes. They'll rise up to puffs of asymmetrical golden loveliness, crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. Serve with roast meat, an array of veg and a jug of rich gravy.

Then have a nap!

Books didn’t always have title pages

Books didn’t always have title pages! The title page only developed gradually over the 15th and 16th centuries.  Before that time, different methods were used to announce the author(s), title, edition, place of publication, printer, publisher and publication date. The elements indicating the beginning and the closing of individual textual units in medieval manuscripts persisted in the period of the earliest printed books. These elements are theincipit, theexplicit, and thecolophon. Just like the design of the book and the layout of the text, the text announcements in manuscripts andincunabulawere the same for a while.

The earliest examples of separate title pages were either blank or contained a simple and abbreviatedlabel-title, which was sometimes joined by woodcut illustrations or theprinter’s device.

By the end of the 15th century and in the first half of the 16th century, elaborate woodengraved title pages, or title pages with intricate decorative borders were made.

From the late 15th century onwards, the amount of information given on the title page was increasing constantly. Author and title statements were joined by information about the edition, secondary authors such as commentators or translators, as well the place of publication, the name of the printer and publisher, theprinter’s device, and the publication date. All of these elements have gradually moved to the title page from thecolophon.

Migration and new life experiences

‘The universe is transformation, life is opinion.’Marcus Aurelius, Book IV, Meditations, c. 121–180 AD

Migration has a transformative effect on identity, whether consciously or otherwise.

Through learning a new language or a new skill, being exposed to something different or by consciously choosing to reinvent yourself, change lies at the heart of migration.

This was certainly the case for Eriton in his submission to Europeana Migration  entitled ‘Learning to play the piano’.

Eriton recounts his story of migration from Brazil to Ireland which was marked by his piano lessons. Moving to learn English in 2014, the changed environment meant that learning piano, something that was an expensive past-time in the small town he left in Rio de Janeiro, was now within his means.

Music is now a part of Eriton’s life, from his leisure time to his work as a carer, with musicality becoming an important part of his new identity in Ireland. ‘Learning music like this is like a new language, a new world opens for you,’ says Eriton, ‘I came to Ireland to learn one language, but ended up learning two.’

‘Where words fail, music speaks.’ ― Hans Christian Andersen

Russell too would see his life path forever transformed when he and his family migrated to Germany in his childhood.

His story 'Dinosaurs in Deutschland' shows the effect of his exposure to a German dinosaur magazine, which would spark within Russell a desire to take his passion seriously.

‘I've always been obsessed with dinosaurs but this magazine was the beginning of me taking it seriously, says Russell, ‘From that time onwards, dinosaurs became an even bigger part of my life. I decided at that age to dedicate my career to them.’

At times, however, a transformation is planned, with migration affording a space for reinvention. Diego Menhanha’s ‘Reinvent yourself’ follows his journey to Dublin, Ireland.

Leaving his car, apartment and steady career as a marketing professional in Brasil, Diego moved to the completely foreign, Ireland. Navigating a new country with a new language came with challenges; from an ill-fated role as a kitchen porter and endless job interviews, Diego now relishes his new life, proficient in English and a successful master’s student; a modern-day inventor of his own life.

‘I arrived in Dublin without any knowledge of English and also anybody to support me,’ says Diego, ‘We can think out of the box and start again; don't be afraid and follow your dreams.’

Migration gives space for new experiences and an opportunity for change. This theme has weaved its way through theMigration Collectionand the many of the works showcased onEuropeana Collections.

The Deutsches Historiches Museum#DHMMeerin Berlin is running aEurope and the sea blog paradefrom 20-25 July 2018, asking people to share posts on the theme 'What does the sea mean to me?'

To me, one of the things it means is mermaids. So I revisited a post I wrote a while ago on that topic, and checked outEuropeana Collectionsagain.

In the intervening time, we've published more mermaids - sothis post from 2013has now been updated with a gallery of more beautiful and historic mermaid material.

I've always been fascinated by the folklore around mermaids, so when I had the opportunity to travel to Copenhagen, Denmark, I had to take the time to seek out this little lady...

The statue by Edvard Eriksen is inspired by the Hans Christian Andersen tale, 'The Little Mermaid'.

It was put in place in Langelinie, Copenhagen in 1955. Andersen's tale is a tragic one, its semi happy ending tagged on,some say, rather uncharacteristically. The little mermaid princess gives up her mermaid form to pursue a human prince. But he marries someone else and she dissolves into sea foam (tragic ending), only to be turned at the last minute into a spirit with an immortal soul (happy ending).

I think one of the reasons I am fascinated by mermaids is because they are elusive and rarely seen in their mermaid form by humans. This means that mermaids could be all around us and we wouldn't know. Those that do see or hear them rarely live to tell the tale - sailors captivated by a mermaid song are lured onto rocks and wrecked. Mermaids who marry human men and live on land adopt a human form.

So, if you're the type who believes in fairies at the bottom of the garden, dancing just out of sight, you may also be the type to believe in mermaids or mermen living amongst us - who couldn't be persuaded that the ghostly sound we hear in the wind during a brisk winter walk along a coastal cliff path isn't the sound of a mermaid hidden amongst the rocks below us, or that what is tickling our feet as we paddle isn't seaweed but a miniature mermaid?

Mermaids are contradictory creatures. They are neither women nor fish. They enchant sailors but lead them to their deaths. In popular folklore, they are innocent and beautiful, think Ariel from the Disney film, but their mythology also involves more gruesome figures.

After finding Eriksen's statue, I did a little more walking around Copenhagen and also discovered these guys...

'Merman with 7 sons', by Suste Bonnén, Copenhagen. Photo by Beth Daley, CC-BY-SA.

These bronze statues are positioned underwater in a canal in the centre of Copenhagen.

The story goes that the merman fell in love with a human woman who agreed to live with him underwater. There, she bore him seven sons but one day, feeling homesick, she followed the sound of the town's church bells, left the sea and never returned. The sculpture shows her family (the seventh son is in his father's arms) trying to find her and begging her to return. The fact that three of the statues were, when I saw them, half-in half-out of the water added to their anguish - did these creatures belong in the water, or out of it?

This question of belonging and of place is central to mermaid mythology, they are half-human, half-fish, they are neither one thing nor another, so how can they belong fully in either place?

To belong in one world they must give up something from the other - for the mermaid in Hans Christian Andersen's tale, to remain a mermaid, she would give up the chance of love, but to live on land and pursue her happiness, she gave up first her voice, and then ultimately, her life.

As an in-betweener, the mermaid can be read as a metaphor for growing up (think Disney's Ariel again). As teenagers and even as adults, I'm sure we've all felt as though we don't quite belong. But I'm not advocating their transformations. Why be limited and be wholly one thing or another? Hybrids are great. Long live the mermaid.

Warfare in an emerging geopolitical landscape

At the end of World War I, the geo-political landscape of Europe changed dramatically. Following the Treaty of Versailles several new nations emerged, among them Finland, Poland, Latvia and Lithuania. The multi-ethnic Empire of Austria-Hungary was divided into  Austria, Hungary, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia. Already before the end of the war the Czechoslovak First Republic had emerged as a result of the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

On 18 October the Czechoslovak declaration of independence was published by the Czechoslovak National Council, signed by Masaryk, Štefánik and Beneš, 1918 in Paris, and proclaimed on October 28 in Prague. Towards the end of the First World War which led to the collapse of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, several ethnic groups and territories with different historical, political, and economic traditions were blended into the new independent Czechoslovak democracy.

It all started with the ambitions of one man, Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, who, after trying to reform theAustro-Hungarianmonarchyinto afederal state,  eventually succeeded in founding the Czechoslovak Republic. When theFirst World Warbroke out in 1914, Masaryk concluded that the best course was to seek an independent country for Czechs and Slovaks, outside Austria-Hungary.

He went into exile and started establishing the so-calledCzechoslovak Legions, an effective fighting force on the side of the Allies in World War I. Already as early as August 1914, the Russian High Command had authorized the formation of a battalion, recruited from Czechs and Slovaks in Russia. The unit went to the front in October 1914 and was attached to the Russian Third Army. Masaryk and his compatriots in exile had the idea to recruit Czech and Slovak prisoners of war (POWs) in Russian camps. However, because of the opposition of the Russian government, this was not possible until the summer of 1917.

The Czechoslovak armed unit in Russia grew very slowly. After three years the Legion was established, first in Russia in 1917, later with other troops fighting in France, Italy and Serbia. Originally all-volunteer forces, these formations were later strengthened by Czech and Slovak prisoners of war or deserters from the Austro-Hungarian Army. By 1918 about 40,000 troops in total were part of the Czech Legion.  Throughout the Europeana 1914-1918 community collection campaign collection days were held in cities in both the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Some of the stories that were contributed at those events refer to the Legion. A few of them are about soldiers who were part of it, fighting in Russia, in Italy or France.

Among the contributions isan interesting document(in German) that tells the story the Austro-Hungarian Infantry-Regiment No. 28, which made headlines in April 1915 as its dissolution was announced. The Prague based regiment consisted of 95% Czechs and 5% other nationalities. Allegedly some Czech volunteers were actively trying to persuade the soldiers to walk over to the Russians. In the article, not only the dissolution of the regiment is mentioned but also the shooting of several officers. Another contribution tells the story of Václav Radil. He was born in Jitkov, Bohemia. According to this story, there was an unwritten agreement in the trenches an not to shoot Russians, or to shoot in the air.

He was taken prisoner by a Cossack and had to work in the woods in Siberia. There he learned about the organization of the Czech Legion and was able to join them in the autumn of 1917. When the war was over he had to travel along the Trans-Siberian railway, along Altai, past the Ural Lake all the way to Vladivostok. He finally arrived in Czechoslovakia in the spring of 1920. Josef Kobza was captured on the Eastern Front in November 1914. Soon after he became one of the recruits of one the first Czech battalions. He would eventually become a corporal in the 9th Rifle Regiment until he was demobilized in December 1919.

While on board of the ship “Karači Maru”, travelling home he produced ahand-illustrated diary'Return'. Soldier Josef Osmer was fighting at the Italian front at Passo Val Maggiore when he was taken prisoner. While staying in the  Padula PoW camp he decided to join the Czechoslovak Legion in April 1918. Amonghis documentsare a certificate issued by the Italian party about his service in the Italian army as well as a testimonial of the Czechoslovak legionary community from 1930.

James Gardiner is a researcher and author who specializes in collecting historical photographs depicting what he calls ‘gay life’. Inhis own words:

How can you have a photographic history of something that was, until very recently, something to hide, not photograph? And for a great many men, still is.[...] Many of us devote enormous energy to making sure that our appearance does not betray us in the wrong place - but does announce us in the right place. The camera, which denies us this flexibility, which fixes everything for ever in a frozen image, in black-and-white, can be a dangerous weapon in the wrong hands.

Gardiner collected photographs, postcards, cartoons, and many more objects depicting LGBTQ+ life in the 19th and 20th Centuries. Some of the most striking photographs in his collection can be found in a photo album of the late Victorian era, showing photographs of men in drag between 1880 and 1889.

Stella is photographed sideways in a white billowing dress and with braided hair. The blushed cheeks and colour on the lips and dress were added later to the sepia photograph, now faded in places.

Who would think this innocent photograph depicts the same person who stood trial in a case that attracted considerable attention from the Victorian-era London public. Stella, known to the court as Ernest Boulton, became famous in Victorian London for standing trial for wearing women’s clothing and alleged homosexual offences (Fanny and Stella, the young men who shocked Victorian England, Neil Mckenna, Faber & Faber, 2013, pp. 25-26)

Before the trial, Ernest had toured frequently with his friend, Fredrick Park, in a theatrical double act where they dressed up in women’s clothing asFanny and Stella. They were often seen at, and sometimes ejected from, social events and theatres around West Londonin drag.

On a spring evening in 1870, they were both arrested and brought to the magistrate’s court under the accusation of performing ‘homosexual acts’. Ernest and Fredrick were still wearing their dresses when they stood before the magistrate, which elicited a buzz from crowds that had gathered to watch and fueled newspaper reports all across London (Neil Mckenna, pp. 27-28). Both ended up being acquitted because of lack of evidence and the absence of an actual law that forbade men from wearing women’s clothing (Neil Mckenna, pp. 572-574).

That Ernest liked to dress up in drag was unmistakably true, as one of the pictures in a Victorian photograph album proves.

The rest of the album is filled with 31 other pictures of men dressed as women in different poses and configurations.

Some wear earrings, others have their hair adorned with tiaras or flowers, and others hold colourful fans or dolls.

Colour was added to a lot of the sepia pictures to show the bright blue and pink dresses, the glimmer of a pearl earring or to shade lips and blushing cheeks.

Although Ernest was sometimes very public about his sexuality and presentation, this was probably very different for most of the other people featured in this photo album. Ernest is the only one photographed we know by name.

In a completely different era and context, the raids and subsequent riots at The Stonewall in 1969 are eerily similar to the Ernest and Park’s story in their use of publicly visible and invisible subversion of norms, their prosecution by authority, and their subsequent liberation from oppression. Stonewall remembrance day, and Pride Month, are about looking back at how others have stood up for their emancipation, and the need to continue subverting and questioning norms.

Migration stories and objects

When we asked people to share their stories and symbolic objects of migration, the responses submitted could be largely separated into two categories: those who emigrated by choice, and those who did not.

Heartbreaking stories of asylum seeking throughout history have been showcased from those who were made refugees and struggled to find new homes for themselves in foreign countries. Perhaps none more so relevant in the wake of World Refugee Day are those then those have been recently disposed from their homes, and their lives, in Syria.

People like Khalil, who left the port city of Latakia, Syria for Brussels.Khalil’s storycenters on the prayer beads that he holds dear as a symbol of his homeland, and a self-drawn picture that shows the horrors of war that he and his family experience.

Khalil describes the horrors of war, the use of chemical weapons and the great burden this has placed on Syria. He refers to Belgium as his ‘current home’.

Another refugee, an independent journalist and Kurdish Syrian, too vividly highlights the horrors and trauma of their experience, submitting an image of their crumbled home.

They write, ‘I did not see a street where my house and my family's house where located. I found a large mountain of stones, burnt houses and a completely destroyed street. It was a difficult situation and I found my dreams and memories under the stones of my ruined house.’

They too describe the horrors of war. Of the death and destruction, and now asylum and safety in Austria.

They write, ‘I want freedom. I want democracy. I want justice.... Austrian police came and saved our lives. Austrian police gave me care and help, so I asked to stay in Austria and I am now happy.’

At Collection days, where the public are invited to share their migration stories and objects, people speak of the catharsis they feel as a result of sharing their experiences. Asylum seeking transforms one notion of home and identity. Sharing and archiving our personal stories stands as an expression of identity and legacy, even in times when these are challenged or transformed.

A Serbian prisoner of war during World War I

Guest blog written by Fabian & Tatjana Vendrig (Serbian language versions below)

“The bread you sent, every Serb took it, they crossed themselves and kissed it and then we all started to cry happy tears”.

This is an excerpt of a letter which Djordje Vukosavljevic, who was mentionedearlier in a blog, sent to his wife on 28/02/1918 from the Prisoners of War (PoW) camp Soltau near Hannover in Northwest Germany. Djordje was a non-commissioned officer of the Serbian army during the First World War and he died 22th January 1919 in a PoW camp in Nieuw-Milligen near Garderen in the Netherlands.

Thus, he never returned to his home country, Serbia. His letters give a small insight about the life of a Serbian Prisoner of War during the First World War in the PoW camps in Germany. These letters are now also available on the Europeana 1914-1918 website, with an English translation and they can be foundhere. Lately it was also discovered, thanks to the great-granddaughter who keeps the letters in the best state as possible, that his brother-in-law, Konstatin Mladenovic, died during the Great War too. The last sign of life was a postcard dated 18/08/1914 written in Klenje near Sabac, Western-Serbia. Here the allies won their first victory when the Serbian army defeated the Austro-Hungarian army during the battle of Cer (15-24th August 1914).

The great-granddaughter also has a letter from Dragomir Rajicic, a tradesman from Gornji Milanovac. He wrote a letter on 19/08/1919 to the wife of Djordje Vukosavljevic to inform her that Djordje died in the Netherlands. It had taken him half a year to get home from the Netherlands. With the kind help of Museum of Rudnik and Takovo Region and with special thanks to Ana Jelic from this museum in Gornji Milanovac the team could also identify Dragomir.Dragomir Rajicic, photo from the book 'Porodični album starog Milanovca' by Dusan Ilic, 1999

It turned out that Dragomir’s brother, Sreten Rajicic, also died in the Netherlands on 22/01/1919 in Enschede. The funeral of Sreten was reported by the Dutch newspaperTubantiaon 24/01/1919, where it was written that a family member, who was also a PoW, attended the funeral.

On Sreten’s death certificate (Enschede 1919 No. 63) it is not written where he is from, so the team of researchers was not aware that Dragomir and Sreten had been brothers.  Only when various sources from Serbia and the Netherlands were combined and analysed, it turned out that they were brothers. Sreten and Djordje were exhumed in May 1938, with 86 other Serbian WWI soldiers who died in the Netherlands and transported to the mausoleum in Jindrichovice which is in the Czech Republic. After the war Dragomir Rajicic continued his father’s business with a bookshop and publishing house for postcards in Gornji Milanovac (the shop on the right on the postcard below, which was published by him).

Tamo daleko is the title of this blog and it is inspired by a famous Serbian song about WWI (link). It is important that those who died “tamo daleko” (there, far away) are not forgotten. The authors of this blog also created a permanent digital remembrance place on the websitewww.secanje.nland will continue with their voluntary research to the fate of the 91 Serbian WWI soldiers who died in the Netherlands.

СРПСКИ

“Хлебац који си послала сваки га је Србин узео у руке, прекрстио и пољубио, ту су настале сузе радованке.” Ово је део из писма Ђорђа Вукосављевић, који је био раније поменуту блогуобјављеном на овом вебсајту, послат супрузи 28.02.1918. године из логора Солтау, близу Хановера у северозападној Немачкој. Ђорђе је био подофицир српске војске током Првог светског рата и преминуо је 22.01.1919. године у логору за ратне војне заробљенике у Њу Милигену, близу Гардерена у Холандији. Никада није успео да се врати у своју домовину, Србију. Његова писма дају увид у живот српског ратног заробљеника током Првог светског рата у логорима у Немачкој. Ова писма, са преводом на енглески су такође доступна на вебсајтуEuropeana 1914-1918и можете их пронаћи овде:линк. Недавно је такође откривено, захваљујући праунуци Ђорђа Вукосављевић која се труди да сачува писма у најбољем могућем стању да је његов зет Константин Младеновић такође умро током Великог рата. Последњи пут је писао 18.08.1914. из места Клење близу Шапца, Западна Србија. Овде је српска армија први пут поразила Аустроугарску током Церске битке (15-24.08.1914). Праунука Зорица такође има писмо Драгомира Рајичића, трговца из Горњег Милановца који је написао писмо Ђорђевој супрузи 19.08.1919. године у коме је обавештава о смрти њеног супруга у Холандији. Требало му је пола године да стигне кући из Холандије. Захваљујући Музеју рудничко-таковског краја и посебно Ани Јелић из музеја, тим је идентификовао Драгомира Рајичић. Испоставило се да је Драгомиров брат, Сретен Рајичић, такође умро у Енсхадеу, Холандији 22.01.1919.  О сахрани је писао и холандски листТубантиа24.01.1919, где је написано да је члан породице, који је такође био ратни заробљеник, присуствовао сахрани. На Сретеновој умрлици (Енсхеде 1919, бр. 63) нe стоји одакле је он, тако да тим истраживача није знао да су Драгомир и Сретен били браћа. Тек када су различити извори из Холандије и Србије анализирани, испоставило се да су њих двојица рођена браћа. Сретен и Ђорђе су ексхумирани у мају 1938. укључујући још 86 других српских војника који су преминули у Холандији након завршетка Првог светског рата, а затим су транспортовани у маузолеј у Јиндриховице, данашњу Чешку. Након рата, Драгомир Рајичић је наставио са послом свог оца, књижаром и издавањем разгледница, у Горњем Милановцу (продавница здесна на разгледници, коју је он издао). Наслов овог блогаТамо далекоје инспирисан познатом српском традиционалном песмом из Првог светског рата (линк). Важно је да се не забораве они који су умрли тамо далеко. Аутори овог блога такође аутори вебсајтаwww.secanje.nl, су решени да наставе са волонтерским истраживањем о судбини 91 војника који су преминули у Холандији током Првог светског рата.

Establishing marriages with other powerful houses in order to expand and stabilize power.

We have recently begun collecting personal stories from people all across Europe relating to migration.

Our new short blog series,Love across borders, is inspired by collections discovered during this project, with stories of romance and love related to migration. Read on to see how new connections and relationships would not have been possible without people moving across the globe!

Through the past centuries, one group of European societies especially were regularly moving from country to country for love, or at least marriage: the nobility.

Many noble families were keen to establish marriages with other powerful houses in order to expand and stabilize their power. In most cases, one of the future partners had to leave a home country to live with the more powerful partners’ families.

One of the most famous love stories is that of Elisabeth of Bavaria, later known as Empress Elisabeth of Austria and Hungary. Empress Sissi's love story and her life have been depicted many times - although the reality was much less romantic.

She grew up in Bavaria as the daughter of Duke Maximilian Joseph in Bavaria. When she was 15, she traveled to Vienna to visit her cousin, theEmperor of Austria Franz Joseph, together with her mother and sister Helene. Their mothers had arranged a marriage between the latter and her cousin. But when Franz Joseph saw Sissi, as she was called by her family, for the first time, he immediately fell for her and decided not to propose to Helene, but to Sissi.

He was quoted: “If I can not have Elisabeth, I will not marry at all” -  which was an affront to his mother. But only five days later, their engagement was officially announced. Although their story has been picked up in several books and films, their marriage has not been so romantic after all. Sissi suffered from the strict rules at the Austrian court and developed depression. Her death shocked the Austrian-Hungarian people, when she was assassinated in 1898.

The love between Queen Victoria and Prince Albert was exceptional for the times they lived in - because they actually had romantic feelings for each other.

Maybe they were already meant for each other when they were born, with both of their mothers employing the same midwife. They were cousins, both born in 1819.

As they were growing up, it was not clear that they would become one of the most important couples in Europe. Victoria was only fifth in line for the British throne and Albert was only heir of an impoverished dukedom in Germany. Several family members tried to arrange a marriage between them, but they were both reluctant to follow their idea. Victoria, especially, who had already become Queen at that time, hesitated to get married and saw no reasons to rush in a possibly unhappy marriage.

She proposed to him in 1839, three years after their first encounter, when they both were sure about their mutual affection. Their marriage has been an unusual happy one compared to other noble relationships at that time. They had nine children together and influenced their country and empire heavily. Albert became especially known for his engagement in education and arts and Victoria was so remarkable as a queen that the century is often called the Victorian era.

When Albert died young at the age of 42, Victoria was devastated. She wore black for the rest of her long life and never married again.

Korngold, Weigl and Krenek in the United States



View through barred windows of the internment building from Ellis Island to the skyscrapers of New York, ca. 1932, CC0

In Austria, the year 2018 is an opportunity to re-examine the turning points of 20th-century history and to ask about their significance for our present. The year 1938, with the "Anschluss" of Austria to the National Socialist German Reich, brought with it massive propaganda, state terror and arrests of political opponents. It also forced mainly Jewish fellow citizens into exile. In the field of culture, in addition to the human tragedies, this led to a massive loss of creativity that continues to be felt today. Three biographies of Austrian composers represent these incidents.

Erich Wolfgang Korngold(29.5.1897, Brno - 29.11.1957, Hollywood), the son of music critic Julius Korngold, was considered a musical prodigy. Through the mediation of his father, he got in contact with Gustav Mahler, who then recommended him to Alexander von Zemlinsky as a composition teacher. The ballet "The Snowman", which he wrote when he was eleven years old, was successfully performed at the Vienna Court Opera in Zemlinsky's Instrumentation. Korngold's operas "The Ring of Polycrates" (1916), "Violanta" (1916), "The Dead City" (1920) and "The Miracle of the Heliane" were among the most performed contemporary operas of this time in Austria and Germany.

In addition, Korngold worked in the 1920s at the Hamburg Stadttheater as a conductor and in the early 1930s held a professorship at the Vienna Music Academy. In 1934 he accepted an invitation to Hollywood to arrange Mendelssohn's incidental music for Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream" for Max Reinhardt's film.Due to the rise of the National Socialists his job opportunities in Germany became less and less and Korngold moved his field of activity more and more to the United States, before he finally settled there after the annexation of Austria to Nazi Germany in 1938.In Hollywood, Korngold became one of the most successful film composers of his time. For the music for the films "Anthony Adverse" (1936) and "The Adventures of Robin Hood" (1938), he was awarded an “Oscar”.After 1945, like many others who had succeeded to escape the Nazi regime, he was never invited to come back to Austria. All his attempts to return from emigration failed and he died in Hollywood in 1957.

The musical talent ofVally Weigl(11.9.1894, Vienna - 25.12.1982, New York) was discovered in her earliest youth and was actively encouraged, especially from her mother. Together with her sister Käthe Leichter - who together with her husband Otto Leichter was one of the founding members of the Revolutionary Socialists in Austria and was murdered by the National Socialists in 1942 - she received piano lessons. In addition, she took music-historical lessons with Guido Adler and composition lessons with Karl Weigl, whom she married in 1921. Forced to flee by the National Socialist seizure of power, she emigrated with her husband and son to the United States.

The early days of the exile were marked by the difficulties of the couple Weigl to gain a foothold in the United States. While Karl Weigl, who died in 1949, could no longer work as a teacher, Vally Weigl began her first compositions. In addition to composing, from the 1950s she developed another field of activity in music therapy. At the center of her compositional work are sociopolitical movements of her time, such as the peace movement of the 1970s. In the US Vally Weigl was known to the wider public; in Austria she is mostly forgotten.

Ernst Krenek(23.8.1900, Vienna - 23.12.1991, Palm Springs) studied composition with Franz Schreker in Vienna. In 1920 he followed his teacher to Berlin. From the mid-1920s on he worked at the opera houses of Kassel and Wiesbaden. His breakthrough was the opera "Jonny spielt auf" (Leipzig 1927). The premiere at the Vienna State Opera at the turn of the year 1927/28 was accompanied by one of the first campaigns initiated by the National Socialist in the field of culture. Nevertheless in 1928 Krenek came back to Vienna. His next opera "Karl V" remained unperformed in Austria for political reasons.

Newspaper report on the premiere of Krenek's opera "Jonny plays on" in Leipzig, 10.2.1927 (Stadtgeschichtliches Museum Leipzig, CC BY NC-SA) In 1938, after the annexation of Austria to Nazi Germany, Krenek emigrated to the United States. Krenek's complete oeuvre is not to be assigned to a musical style. The stylistic diversity of his Oeuvre ranges from Expressionist works ("Orpheus and Eurydice", 1926) to "Gebrauchsmusik" ("Jonny spielt auf ", 1927) to a recourse to Romanticism in the song cycle " Reisetagebuch aus den österreichischen Alpen" (1929), up to twelve-tone technique, serial music and electronic music in the 1960s. Both, Vally Weigl and Ernst Krenek, found their professional and artistic opportunities in the United States. The forced exodus of artists and scientists left a gap in Austria that could never be filled until today.

How text has influenced how, what and why we read

The shape of the text has influenced how, what and why we read. This is the first blog of theRise of Literacy project, where we take you from papyri to universities, exploring literacy in Europe thanks to the digital preservation of precious textual works from collections across Europe.2000 years ago, texts were written on scrolls of papyrus. Only between the 2nd and 3rd centuries, thecodex- the bound book as we know it - became common.  In Ancient Greece and the early Roman Empire, reading meant holding such avolumenwith both hands and unrolling it from right to left.

If you think that was hard, consider that punctuation - as we know it - didn’t exist! Words could be separated from one another with a full stop or even not separated at all (_scriptio continu_a). Nonetheless, reading was a popular practice, even amongst the less educated. It was common to read aloud in public: educated slaves, landlords or authors themselves would read aloud following rhetorical rules to give the right inflexion. The important art of oratory is described by authors like Quintilianus ( c. 35-96 AD).

Quintilian from BL Burn 244, f. 2. Marcus Fabius Quintilianus (index Quintilian). British Library, public domain

Quote from Quintilianus,Institutio Oratoria

“There is much that can only be taught in actual practice, as for instance when the boy should take breath, at what point he should introduce a pause into a line, where the sense ends or begins (...) and when he should speak with greater or less energy”

Contrasted with the overtly public practice of reading aloud, the early Medieval Christian way of reading (IV-XI cent.) was remarkably different. The book, now in the form of a codex (the book as we know it), was the shrine of the word of God. Reading became slower, more personal and silent.  People used to read a small number of texts several times, possibly learning them by heart. This explains the prominence of theBook of Hours, small books containing Psalms, prayers and religious offices collected for individual worship (see our collection onEuropeana). In this era of low literacy, official as well as religious texts were still written in Latin across almost all of Europe, but not everybody could understand Latin. Irish scribes in particular helped to further the reading and understanding of Latin texts by introducing new features, like the more obvious division of words and sentences via punctuation marks and thelitterae notabiliores: from simple letters in a different color, to the large illuminated letters we commonly associate with illuminated manuscripts that highlight new chapters and paragraphs.

Quote from Hugh of Saint Victor, Didascalicon

“Therefore I beg you, reader, not to rejoice too greatly if you have read much, but if you have understood much. Nor that you have understood much, but that you have been able to retain it.”

The establishment of universities in the 12th century brought more remarkable changes. As now the book was read with an academic scope, the text was often displayed in two columns, allowing faster reading and leaving space for writing notes.

The life and works of the influential composer Richard Wagner

When it comes to the life and works of the influential composer Richard Wagner (1813 - 1883), Europeana, once again, is able to bring together so much interesting material from many cultural institutions across Europe. First of all, there is his music: early recordings of Wagner's epic four-part Ring cycle, starting withDas Rheingold, thenDie Walküre, ontoSiegfriedand - in every possible way, finally -Götterdämmerung.

His other works - such asParsifal,Die Meistersinger von NürnbergandLohengrin- are also well represented. Elsewhere on Europeana, there arevarious depictions of Wagner and his wife Cosima; and, also,musical scores, notes and letters in Wagner's hand.

Last but not least, there are several examples ofthe Wagner tuba on Europeana. This instrument, inspired by Adolphe Sax'ssaxhorn, was invented by Wagner to combine elements of the trombone with the French horn. The Wagner tuba, which rather resembles an oval-shaped French horn, is used to play the "Valhalla" leitmotif in Wagner's Ring cycle.

War brought pain and people together who may never have otherwise met.

We have recently begun collecting personal stories from people all across Europe relating to migration, following on from our successful Europeana 1914-1918 project.

This short blog series,Love across borders, is inspired by collections discovered during this project, with stories of romance and love at the time of World War 1. Read on to see how new connections and relationships would not have been possible without people moving across the globe!

Wars like the First World War brought a lot of pain and terror in the countries involved. But they also brought people together who may never have otherwise met. Just like Maria Apollonia Rittel and the American soldier who later became the father of her child.

In 1919, when the war was finally over, Maria Apollonia was a young tailor living in Düsseldorf, Germany. She met an American soldier who was stationed in Koblenz and fell in love with him. He was a Captain of the 3rd US Army’s Medical Corps. When he had to return to the US with his troops, he promised her that she could join him there later.

But this never happened, as on the way back to the US his ship sank. This was the only information Maria heard. They never saw each other again. Still, there has always been someone to remind her of this romantic episode: Karl, the son who never got to know his father.

Until today, this remains a gap in the family’s history. Karl’s son, Michael only owns one picture of his grandfather and is still searching for more information about him and this love story.

New connections and relationships would not have been possible without people moving across the globe

We have recently begun collecting personal stories from people all across Europe relating to migration, following on from our successful Europeana 1914-1918 project.

This new, short blog series,Love across borders, is inspired by collections discovered during this project, with stories of romance and love at the time of World War 1. Read on to see how new connections and relationships would not have been possible without people moving across the globe!

This postcard, dating from 1916, was sent from Corsica by a young Serbian woman called Ljubica who lived there during World War 1.

Serbia was at the centre the First World War. It was a Serbian student who attacked the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. As there had been earlier troubles between Austria and Serbia, this was used as an excuse to finally declare war on Serbia. Many Serbians fled to escape from the terrors of war - including Ljubica, along with her sister and brothers. The young woman managed to escape to Greece where she met the French army. They took her to the French island Corsica and later on to Nice and Beaulieu-sur-Mer. There, on the French riviera, she met the love of her life: Blagoje Ristić.

Blagoje was also Serbian, and a teacher in the small city Beaulieu-sur-Mer. They met at the local school for teachers where several Serbian students studied. Together, they stayed several years in the South of France.

When the war was over, they went back to Serbia, where a new kingdom was announced: The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. They continued working as teachers in Serbia, the profession that bond them together. But they did not stay alone: They had three children, seven grandchildren, eleven great-grandchildren and five great-great-grandchildren. A story with a happy ending that could not have been told without them meeting far away from home.

Stories of romance and love at the time of World War

We have recently begun collecting personal stories from people all across Europe relating to migration, following on from our successful Europeana 1914-1918 project.

Our new short blog series,Love across borders, is inspired by collections discovered during this project, with stories of romance and love at the time of World War 1. Read on to see how new connections and relationships would not have been possible without people moving across the globe!

During summer 1912, the young German student Georg Schröter spent his holidays on the beautiful Isle of Wight, an island in the south of England known for its idyllic beaches and promenades. There, he met Marguerite Vincent.

She was a young woman from Southampton, actively involved in the politics of that time. She declared herself an English patriot and was member of the Southampton Ladies Conservative Association. Obviously, they were attracted by each other and started an intense pen friendship.

Later, Marguerite wrote about their first meeting: "What a dirty, untidy, little English girl you must have thought me! (Gurnard is) a quiet little place, where no one hardly goes. We wore all our very oldest clothes, things we could not possibly wear in Southampton. We tore them in holes & got them as dirty as we liked."

They planned seeing each others again, as Georg explains in one letter: "And as soon as my father gives me permission, I will come back over the channel - but there will be some years passing, until I can carry out my plan. I intend to work hard further(more)..."

Their letters are heavily influenced by the political events of that time. They discuss wars, political tensions and nationalist feelings during the two-years time of their correspondence. Georg writes: "It would be the saddest day of my life if the Triple Alliance went to war against the Triple Entente." And Marguerite answers: "In my bed-room I have three little flags I bought one day, the flags of the three greatest Nations in the World - Germany, France & England! How I should like to see a ‘Triple Entente’ between those Countries!"

The last postcard Georg received is from 24 July 1914, four days before the Austrians declared war on Serbia, the beginning of World War 1. We do not know why their friendship ended, but it is likely that the nationalist propaganda of that time made a relationship like Marguerite and Georg’s impossible.

New perspectives on John Burke

The past few years have witnessed a renewed interest in vintage and vernacular photography and photographic archives in general. This increase in attention is clearly reflected within the arts. More and more photographers / artists blend their own creations with existing photographs or use vintage photography and old techniques as a basis for new works of art.

An outstanding example is the work of Simon Norfolk, who revisited the photographs of John Burke.

In 1878John Burke, an Irish photographer based in India, accompanied British army forces during an invasion in Afghanistan. There he produced a small number of albums with prints to be sold to the general public in his studio in India. These images are the first photos produced in Afghanistan known to date.

In 2001Simon Norfolk(UK) went to Afghanistan and produced the highly acclaimed photo bookChronotopia(Dewi Lewis, 2002). Inspired by romantic paintings of the 18th century with their golden lights, Norfolk explored the aftermath of the conflicts that struck Afghanistan the past decades.

The images, shot in yellowish, warm light, hint at an Afghanistan that is at the close of one thing and at a beginning of something new. Norfolk, disappointed in the continuation of the war in Afghanistan in the following years, sought a point of departure to return and produce a new body of work.

When Brian Liddy, curator at theNational Media Museum in Bradford,showed Norfolk a Burke album, he knew he had found it. Seeing history repeating itself, Norfolk set out to Afghanistan to photograph in the spirit of John Burke: what would John Burke have shot if he had lived today?

These images are the first photographs produced in Afghanistan known to date

Simon Norfolk did not aim at rephotographing the views and subjects, but at matching the spirit in which John Burke took his images. Early photography was a very costly affair and mostly institutionalised. Snapshot photography as we know it today, didn’t exist. Burke is a very complete photographer, shooting landscapes, (group) portraits, news and events. His images are quite lyrical and emotional.

This might be explained by the fact that his trip to Afghanistan was a commercial undertaking, and that his images and albums were intended to be sold as a souvenir to soldiers, officers, etc.. This also partly explains why no battles or aftermaths of fighting scenes are depicted, even though they were taken on a military campaign of the British Army: such images have no commercial value.

Burke’s background also comes into play: he was a Catholic Irishman, with no formal training. Working for the British army thus makes him somewhat of a bystander.

History is clearly repeating itself

Norfolk shoots the same types of subjects as Burke: portraits, city views and military installations. The latter two are presented in colour, the portraits in black and white.

Throughout the book and exhibition, Norfolk’s images are mixed with Burke’s to form one body of work. The Burke + Norfolk project highlights analogies and similarities: here, history is clearly repeating itself, over a time lapse of 130 years.

Remembering the Great War in Luxembourg

This month’s focus of the Europeana 1914-1918 Centenary Tour is on Luxembourg. In ourdedicated gallery, a selection of images depicting various aspects of life during the First World War in the Grand Duchy can be viewed.  In addition, you can browse through all thecontributionsthat were made at the collection days that were held in March 2012 in Luxembourg. This includes the touchingstory of Charles Graussand thefigurineshe made for his children while serving in the French army.

For a more in-depth insight in this important but neglected and understudied period in the history of the Grand Duchy we would like to point at two other initiatives of WW1 Centenary commemorations by our Europeana 1914-1918 project partners: the University of Luxembourg and the Centre de documentation sur les migrations humaines (CDMH).

In cooperation with the Ministry of State the University of Luxembourg designed the digital exhibitionÉischte Welkrich: Remembering the Great War in Luxembourg. Drawing on the collections and expertise of some of the major Luxembourgish museums, archives and cultural institutions the project has progressively deepened and widened its scope, aspiring to become a long-term online resource.

The website is designed to engage a broad base of users with varying interests and degrees of expertise. It is available in three languages (French, German and English) and offers four independent but interconnected modes of navigation: a story-driven mode, a digital archive, an interactive geo-referenced map and a timeline. Additional sections contain educational pages for schools and downloadable academic articles.

All salient Luxembourgish locations linked to WW1 (war cemeteries, hospitals, bombed sites, shelters etc.) are displayed on an interactive map which provides a geo-exploration mode. Enabling location-awareness when viewing the website on mobile devices allows the user to discover the relevant places located in the proximity and use the website as a touring app.

TheTimelineoffers a more classic event-based exploration, following a chronology that can be expanded to reveal the significant events for each year with groups of associated objects linking back to the Collection.

The overall structure of the exhibition remains flexible and open, allowing for the continuous integration of new themes and documents, either provided by institutions or crowdsourced.

The exhibition project has been directed by Prof Andreas Fickers and Prof Denis Scuto and curated and coordinated by Dr Sandra Camarda and is accompanied by a rich programme of related activities, conferences, workshops, and publications.

As part of this programme, the offline exhibition “Être ailleurs en temps de guerre (14-18) – Étrangers à Dudelange / Dudelangeois à l’étranger” runs from 29 March to 9 December 2018 at theCentre de Documentation sur les Migrations Humainesin Dudelange. The exhibition explores the experience of the migrant town of Dudelange during the First World War, looking at the various trajectories drawn by those who left, arrived or remained within its borders. You can see a video teaserhere.

The exhibition, curated by Antoinette Reuter, Denis Scuto and Sandra Camarda, is a collaboration between theCDMH - Centre de Documentation sur les Migrations humainesand theC2DH - Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History, University of Luxembourg.

Both the digital exhibition Éischte Weltkrich and the exhibition in Dudelange are part of the “2018 European Year of Cultural Heritage” program. Within this frame the Centre de Documentation sur les Migrations humaines will host a Europeana Migration Collection Day on 23 September 2018 around the theme of migration in Luxembourg during the First World War.

Stories of romance and love through migration

We have recently begun collecting personal stories from people all across Europe relating to migration.

Our new short blog series,Love across borders, is inspired by collections discovered during this project, with stories of romance and love related to migration. Read on to see how new connections and relationships would not have been possible without people moving across the globe!

This building is primarily known for its global significance for World Peace:The Peace Palacein The Hague. But, today it would look totally different without a certain couple: Herman Rosse and Sophia Helena Luyt.

Both were born in The Hague and in their mid-twenties, when they started working on the construction site of the Peace Palace.

Herman had already seen a lot of different places. After starting his studies of architecture and design at the Academy of Art in The Hague, he went to study in London and Stanford, California. Although he was young, he was hired to produce most of the decorative interior designs for the Peace Palace from 1911 to 1913, working on the paintings, colourful windows, tiles and marquetry.

But all the beauty he created did not distract him from a certain woman working nearby him. Sophia Helena Luyt was a landscape artist responsible for creating and designing the gardens that surround the Peace Palace, which today attract visitors throughout the year.

He was so in love with her, seeing her every day through empty holes where we today see amazing stained glass, that he perpetuated her beauty in one of his artworks. One of the goddesses painted on the ceiling of the grand entrance hall has Sophia’s face.

Obviously, she felt the same and, after their work in the Peace Palace was finished, they married in London in 1913.

Together, they started a life of migration. They lived in Palo Alto, California, Illinois, New York and Hollywood. He also designed film sets and became the first Dutch person to win an Oscar for his work in the filmKing of Jazz.

Although they both left marks of their creativity in the whole world, especially their artistic heritage of the Peace Palace stands today as a reminder of this special love story.

During our campaigns likeEuropeana MigrationandEuropeana 1914-1918, we bring a digital perspective to our Collection Days with partner institutions all over Europe.

During these days, we collect, digitise and preserve the stories and objects of the European people. This is a distinct approach, compared to how objects usually are found in our online collections.

One might ask: what can these objects add to our understanding of our European shared culture which can already be found in museums, galleries, libraries and archives?

Above, you see the Cup of the Court of Justice of Voorne and Putten, preserved in the collection of theRijksmuseumin Amsterdam. It is a marvellous object that tells us stories about the powerful and wealthy, who shaped Europe and its politics, economics and culture.

During our recent Collection Day held in Brussels at theHouse of European History, we were able to listen to the stories of two other silver cups, which we share to show how they contribute to Europeana’s mission to transform the world with culture.

SM brought his silver cup with him to Brussels in 2011, when he and his family moved from New Delhi, where he was born in 2008, .

He shared the cultural background of this special object: 'It is a cultural belief that when a baby is born, you should feed him out of silverware. Its good and precious characteristics make the babies smart, strong and precious.'

Georges’coupe d’argenthas a totally different background: It was made in Warsaw in 1836 to celebrate the 25-year wedding anniversary of Georges’ great-great-great-grandparents.

For almost a century, the cup has been passed on from family member to family member to celebrate silver weddings - and eventually migrated to Brussels to celebrate his great-grandfather’s wedding anniversary in 1895 who by then had moved to Belgium.

Although these two cups are - apart from their material characteristics - so different, they tell European stories that aren’t found in many museums.

With our Europeana Migration campaign, we are aiming to reflect Europe’s rich and shared history of migration.

Besides the Court of Justice of Voorne and Putten, European culture is made up from everyday encounters, customs and traditions of all people who live in Europe - just like SM  and Georges as well as their families. We celebrate these two new cups in our collection next toKiddush cups with Hebrew engravings, photographs ofFrench actors drinking champagneandsymbols of Christian charity.

Because all of these objects together tell the story of the most prominent feature of European culture - diversity!

How composer Handel migrated to London in the 18th century

In the early 18th century, London was the eldorado for musicians, offering fame and fortune to anyone who had something new or exclusive to boast. Foreign musicians were regarded as exotic, special and prestigious, and therefore very popular both with rich patrons and the general public.

As a result, London offered the highest wages for musicians in Europe, which prompted many an international star to flock to the United Kingdom.



In the midst of this musical migration wave, one man carried the banner:Georg Friedrich Händel. In the same year of his appointment as ‘Kapellmeister’ at the electoral court of prince George inHanover- the largest city of the German state of Lower Saxony - Händel was invited to write an opera for London.

Up to that time, Italian operas had proved to be popular on London stages, but all of them had been arrangements of earlier works orpasticcios.

Now Händel was to compose the first one specifically for the London stage:Rinaldo, which premiered on 24 February 1711. By then, Handel had already left a favorable impression with the Londoners as his (now lost)Dialogue in Italian, in Her Majesty’s praisewas performed at St James’s Palace onQueen Anne’s birthday just a few weeks earlier.

It soon became apparent to Händel that London was the place to be for the ambitious and enterprising musician. By 1717 he had settled permanently in England and in February 1727 he was naturalized by Act of Parliament. During his remaining 30 years, Händel composed c. 40 operas, from historical epics (Giulio Cesare) to mythological tales (Atalanta).

His audience was London's high society, which did not want to miss any of his creations, nor the rivalry between the divas he worked with. SopranosFaustina Bordoniand Francesca Cuzzoni in particular were (in)famous for their fuming rows, which sometimes unfolded on stage, in front of the feasting crowd...

When it became more difficult for the nobility - for whom these operas were primarily intended - to finance the spectacles, the genre fell into decay. Now Händel shifted his focus toward theoratorio.The development of this genre in England can almost entirely be attributed to him, and he created its most well-known example as well: the epic choir oratorioThe Messiah(1741).

From 1747 onward, Händel had his own oratorio series at Covent Garden, which ran during Lent when no plays or operas were allowed. In addition to a great deal of vocal music, Händel continued to produce new instrumental music in London, such as theConcerti grossiopus 6 and theWater Music, which ranks among his most popular pages.

Even though water is not the theme of these suites, it figures at the heart of their origin: the first performance took place on a boat on the river Thames, at the occasion ofa royal tripfrom Whitehall to Chelsea.

In addition to theaters and palaces, London’s pleasure gardens too tucked into Händel's music, with the avant-premiere ofMusic for the Royal Fireworks(Vauxhall gardens) and the organ concertos (which were performed almost every day) as the absolute highlights.

Who would not wish to have been a musician (or a melomaniac) in Händel's London? A playing field for artists, a copious buffet with the most varied flavors, a sanctuary for geniuses and entrepreneurs... It might be true that Händel’s genius could have flourished at any time and in any place, but his visionary step towards life as a Londoner probably got him launched into stardom much quicker - and much higher - than any other scenario would have.

A Polish star in the German sky

From Europe to America (and back again)

Meet the extraordinary Pola Negri: Poland’s first film star and the only Pole to make her American dream come true in Hollywood.

She was a true European equally at home in Warsaw, Berlin and Paris, afemme fataleon the screen but a hard-working woman in real life, a fashion trendsetter and the author of her own legend, an actress who earned a permanent place in the annals of world cinema, and a migrant whose own story reflects the turbulent history of the 20th century.

Pola Negri was a film legend with a film-worthy story.

Born Apolonia Barbara Chałupiec, her life is a 20th-century retelling of Cinderella. It is a tale of extraordinary social ascent: from a poor riverside neighbourhood in Warsaw,Polandto Hollywood, by way of Berlin, from a humble attic room to a mansion in suburbanParis.

Hers is a story of triumph through sheer talent, hard work and determination. She overcame social and linguistic barriers. The daughter of a washer-woman and tin-smith, she mastered five languages and briefly became a Polish countess and Georgian princess (though only briefly - both marriages failed), and her celebrity status eclipsed her lowly origins.

Her tale is also one of movie stardom, easier to achieve in a globalised era of silent film, but impressive nonetheless. While many actresses of the time boasted large eyes and dark eyelids, and heavily emphasised their facial expressions, the aesthetic came to be personified by Pola Negri.

Negri’s story is also one of unfulfilled dreams. Unable to pursue a career in ballet due to an illness, Pola enrolled in acting school.

Her successful performance in the pantomimeSumurunlaunched the 16-year-old into the nascent world of film.

Aleksander Hertz, the owner of Sfinks, Poland’s largest movie studio, turned Pola into the country’s first film star.

After debuting inSlave to Her Senses(Niewolnica zmysłów, 1914), the beautiful actress accepted a number of roles as afemme fatalewho ruins the lives of the men who fall for her. With her distinctive eyes and sensual dance style, Negri was already developing a visual trademark.

Leaving Warsaw behind, in 1917 the 'Polish Asta Nielsen' heads to Berlin, making movies for Saturn-Film.

She later strikes these pictures from her official filmography, highlighting instead her theatrical work with Max Reinhardt and cinema productions for her Pygmalion, Ernst Lubitsch. Hertz may have discovered Pola Negri and launched her career, but it was the German director who turned her into a true actress.

Together, Negri and Lubitsch made five films, includingCarmen(1918), in which her beauty, talent for dancing, and cat-like charm help solidify her image as an exoticfemme fatale. Finally,Madame Dubarry(1919), in which Pola plays a suggestively erotic role, takes Europe and America by storm and helping to end German’s post-war isolation. For both of them, the movie is a ticket to Hollywood.

Pola redeems that ticket in 1923, becoming the first European film star imported by Tinseltown.

The famous face of Germany’s UFA studio is now a star in the Paramount Pictures constellation. She makes millions (prudently investing her earnings in real estate), but without Lubitsch by her side, her acting career stalls. They made just one Hollywood picture together,Forbidden Paradise(1924), widely considered her best US film.

But Hollywood is becoming increasingly puritanical, and Pola has trouble landing parts that would fully embody her role as a sensual, European woman, fully aware of her magnetic eroticism.

Realising this, she decides to play the Hollywood star, parading her pet cheetah around and setting new fashion trends such as turbans and red painted toenails. She drives a Rolls Royce and is seen on the arms of famous men, among them Charlie Chaplin and Rudolph Valentino.

The rise of the talkie spells disaster for many silent film stars, but Pola passes the voice test. Her gravely contralto becomes yet another asset, allowing her to break into the music business.

But Hollywood is changing. Faced with ever more competitors and a paucity of good parts, in the late 1920s, Pola heads back to Europe: first to England and the theatre, and later toGermany. There, she resumes her role as a movie star, but at the cost of legitimising the regime.

Though she ends up leaving the Third Reich to escape a compulsory part in an anti-Polish film, her work in Nazi Germany casts a shadow over her future life in America, especially when hunted by a gossip of Hitler watchingMazurka(1935), starring his favourite actress, during bouts of insomnia.

In 1941, she packs up her life into a couple of suitcases and returns to America viaLisbon.

Twenty years earlier, she arrived to a welcome worthy of a silver-screen goddess. Now she is greeted as a mere mortal, one ofmany emigrants quarantined on Ellis Island.

Pola's return to the film world is brief. She showcases her comedic talent inHi Diddle Diddle(1943) and shuts the door on her movie career as the eccentric Madame Habib inThe Moon-Spinners(1964). In 1970 ,she publishes a heavily-airbrushed (and self-aggrandising) memoir titledMemoirs of a Star, setting a trap for future biographers. With help from a wealthy friend, she settles down comfortably in Texas.

Born a subject of the Russian tsar in Lipno, outside Warsaw, she dies an American citizen in San Antonio. Though she visited Europe after World War II, the Polish thespian never returned to her home country.

Talking about a photograph taken on board a ship arriving at Ellis Island

Today, Manuele Buono, of AEDEKA srl in Italy, talks about a photograph taken on board a ship arriving at Ellis Island in the early 20th century.

I love this photo. It's a striking reminder of the fact that once millions of Europeans just like me (yet not only Italians, but also Hungarians, Poles, Germans, Slavs, Scottish, Irish, Turks and many others) were on board of these ships - not an undefined mass of people from the other side of the world.

Furthermore, the ship happens to be arriving at Ellis Island: a genuine monument to migration, a symbol of generations of exiles and refugees looking for a future.

This picture makes me realise that we have forgotten - or not yet sufficiently studied - the history of migration. Because since prehistoric times, men and women from all corners of the globe have tried to preserve and improve their existence by taking up the gauntlet and abandoning their house and homeland.

Inconvenience and uncertainty didn't make them relinquish their plans, while surely they must have been aware of the risks of such a journey - the possibly deadly turn it might even take. As a result, the contemporary European population is the product of epochal and massive migrations of people from the southeast of the Mediterranean and from the Far East.

Yet this part of history - a part that we all share - seems to be disregarded nowadays. We live in an atmosphere of increasing and widespread fear. Fear toward people arriving in most parts of Europe, escaping from hunger, misery and war. So by choosing this photograph, I was hoping to set off  a “warning light”: let us not forget the past if we want to avoid repeating the errors and disasters we've experienced in the last century.

Stories of romance and love at the time of World War 1

We have recently begun collecting personal stories from people all across Europe relating to migration, following on from our successful Europeana 1914-1918 project.

Our new short blog series,Love across borders, is inspired by collections discovered during this project, with stories of romance and love at the time of World War 1. Read on to see how new connections and relationships would not have been possible without people moving across the globe!

August and Gommaire were two brothers from Duffel, a Belgian city near Antwerp. In 1914, August was conscripted and Gommaire, his older brother, volunteered. Both were enlisted in the fifth “linieregiment”.

At the same time, many civilians fled from Belgium to escape from the war zone. Henriette lived her mother and sisters in Antwerp when the war broke out. The family left Antwerp for the Netherlands shortly after Germany invaded Belgium. Afterwards, she managed to flee to Richmond, England with her sister and her brother-in-law. To earn her living, she worked in a munitions factory which soon deteriorated her health.

August and Gommaire were at the same time allowed to spend their leave in England. August met Henriette on leave in England and they fell in love with each other. They stayed in contact throughout the war. All three exchanged letters afterwards, when the brothers were back on the front.  Gommaire was also interested in Henriette. Finally, Henriette decided for August, the younger brother, as evidenced by a number of letters.

Both brother returned safely from war. Afterwards, in 1919, August and Henriette married in Antwerp. They settled near Brussels where August became a bookkeeper.

Sharing your own personal migration history can help us to tell a really big story - the story of Europe and the people who live here. We invite you to share your story - through objects like pictures, letters, postcards or recipes - with Europeana Migration, by visitinghttps://migration.europeana.eu/share

These objects are important parts of your heritage. Recording and digitising them is easier than you might think. Once it’s done, they will become part of the Europeana Migration Collection.

Your story is part of Europe’s rich and shared history of migration, and now it can be recorded for the future, and made freely available for anyone to discover and use for education, research, inspiration and pleasure.

Here are some of the stories that have been shared so far.

In addition to being able to contribute online, today sees the launch of our Europeana Migration Collection Days, events with partner institutions designed to engage local communities and help tell the story of Europe through migration.

Ourfirst eventof this pan-European campaign kicks off today, Thursday 15th through to Saturday 17th March, in partnership with the House of European History, in Brussels.

Throughout 2018, the European Year of Cultural Heritage, Europeana will run a series of collection days and events involving museums, libraries, archives and audiovisual collections across Europe asking people to add their personal migration stories, with material such as pictures, diaries, videos and letters, to the collection.

Further events will be held throughout 2018 in Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, Wales, Luxembourg, Croatia and Latvia.See here for the full list.

Analysing a striking photo taken in Amsterdam

Street photography could well be the oldest form of photography, as the medium was initially invented to capture and study life in its purest form. The first still and moving pictures were mostly aimed toward illustrative outcomes, such as the work of the Lumière brothers  (who captured common street scenes, e.g. their employees leaving their factory), Eugène Atget (who documented Paris in the pre-Haussmannian era) or Eadweard Muybridge (who developed photographic techniques to study movement).

Capturing the intangible and elusive features of life has always been somewhat difficult to crystallize into absolute theories and definitions. Therefore, the ability of an artist to go beyond established aesthetics in order to simply demonstrate, in new and fresh manners, what life really looks like, has continuously been praised. An impressionist painter and photographer alike,George Hendrik Breitner, was the creator of many powerful pictures of life in the Netherlands at the end of the 19th century.

He focused on street scenes, portraits and intimate shots, often as reference material for his paintings - which earned him great acclaim. But his photographic oeuvre, beside and beyond underpinning his painting process, also set the course for future documentary photography. Beyond its artistic value, this oeuvre also serves as a very early testimony of proper street photography codes and offers a compelling vision of the laborious life of Dutch (anonymous) people at the beginning of the industrial age.



Straatgezicht op de kruising Lindengracht Lijnbaansgracht in Amsterdam, George Hendrik Breitner, ca. 1890 - ca. 1910. Rijksmuseum, Public Domain Mark

Straatgezicht op de kruising Lindengracht Lijnbaansgracht in Amsterdam(Street view of the intersection of Lindengracht Lijnbaansgracht in Amsterdam), in my view, represents all of those characteristics. First, the simplicity of the frame drags the spectator in, owing to the crossing of two strong diagonals right at the focal point of the scene: a lady, probably on her way to a next task during her working day. Despite the fact that the shot depicts other moving elements as a wall (the wagon in the background and the boy on the right), the intensity of this leading lady is striking. Her determined gait and dismissive gaze - barely acknowledging the presence of the camera (at a time when such an apparatus was rather noticeable and still very uncommon) are enough to make this picture a compelling showcase of life: undisturbed in her daily routine, wrapped like a Greek goddess by her floating apron, this woman is called by a duty and a purpose we will never know.

It’s easy to look at this image and to get reminded of our own hectic daily life. Or to get us pondering on social inequalities. All this in one picture of a street corner: that’s the magic of photography.

If you have to ask what jazz is, you'll never know.

So spoke the trumpeter Louis Armstrong, when asked to provide a definition.

As the subject of jazz straddles the months of January and February in 2018 on Europeana Music, we take at look at the sounds, images and footage of jazz on Europeana, provided by so many cultural heritage institutions from across Europe and beyond.

To highlight the genre of jazz, first a gallery:a selection of portraits of the Jazz Greats, including Louis Armstrong, Art Blakey, Ella Fitzgerald and more.

It's worth noting that, as jazz is a relatively recent musical genre, much of the material is still in copyright. So, it's really heartening to discover that there are so many jazz-related sound recordings, photographs which have been made accessible on Europeana.

There are also some excellent videos. For example, here'sa short clip of vibraphonist Gary Burton's quartet from 1970. They start playing from 1'35" - it's well worth the wait! And here you can see bassistCharles Mingus and his band perform "Better Git It In Your Soul" from 1962. There are there are 59 entries for Duke Ellington's "Mood Indigo" alone on Europeana - one particularly wonderful version issung by the basso profundo Paul Robeson.

We can't provide a better definition of jazz than Louis Armstrong, but hope you have a chance to look at the amazingly diverse content that represents the genre on the Europeana pages.

The “Pater Seraphicus” of modern French music

On this International Migrants’ Day, Sofie Taes, musicologist & co-curator of theEuropeana Photography Collectionfor PHOTOCONSORTIUM / KU Leuven, zooms in on the life and work of a brave Belgian who altered the course of French music history.

In the twilight of the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871), in which it led significant losses against Germany, France explored different avenues to reinforce its national identity.

Music was a key element in that strategy as, at the time, the work of German composers took pride of place at concert stages all around Europe.

Throughout the 19th Century, France hadn’t been able to counter that dominance with an authoritative repertoire of its own. TheSociété Nationale de Musique, established by Camille Saint-Saëns and Romain Bussine on 25 February 1871, aimed at accomplishing just that. By organising concerts featuring national composers, the society created opportunities for new work to be heard and for French music to gain a following of its own.

The broader movement aimed at furthering a strong national music culture, operated under the motto “Ars Gallica”, literally meaning “a French Art”. Many a notable composer supported the cause, among which Jules Massenet, Gabriel Fauré and Henri Duparc. Little known, however, is the fact that one of the main governors of this French renaissance was a Belgian!

César-Auguste-Jean-Guillaume-Hubert Franck (1822-1890) was born in Liège - a city in the southern part of today’s Belgium - into the family of a Walloon father and a mother of German descent. His striking musical talent earned him a spot at the conservatory of Liège, which he entered at the age of 8.

He developed as a pianist so prosperously that in 1834 his father - who wanted him to become a famous virtuoso - took him on tour. Having subsequently been sent to Paris to study with Bohemian composer Anton Reicha, César Franck was joined by his family in 1836 and applied to enter theconservatory. Initially refused on grounds of nationality, however, Franck had to wait for a whole year while his father secured naturalisation papers. He was eventually enrolled on 4 October 1837.

Gaining several honors for his musical accomplishments in the next few years, Franck could start contemplating entering the competition for the much-covetedPrix de Rome: a yearly contest for young talents, with a study-leave in Rome as the grand prize. At this time, Franck had already completed his first compositions, and would probably have devoted such a ‘sabbatical’ to explore his increasing fascination for the organ and his talent for writing chamber music.

However, his father remained set on a career for him as a star on the stage. As a consequence, he was removed from the conservatory in 1842 and taken on another concert tour in Belgium with his brother, a violinist.

Soon, however, the life of Franck would take a definitive turn: seeing his career as a virtuoso dwindling rapidly due to psychological pressure, physical issues, bad press reviews and a demanding teaching practice, Franck freed himself from his father.

He left Belgium, married actress Félicité Saillot in 1848 and settled down in Paris, where he would lead a simple, ascetic life and became one of the most revered artists of his time.

His appointment at the conservatory (1872) was the peak of Franck’s career and a milestone in the development of French music: contrary to his predecessor, Charles-Marie Widor, Franck focused his organ lessons not on playing technique and virtuosity, but on the style, form and structure of music – his lessons thereby quickly evolving into an ‘unofficial’ composition course.

The circle of friends and pupils that gathered around Franck (nicknamed ‘le brave père Franck’ and ‘pater seraphicus’ because of his gentle nature), shared his mission to try and outweigh the superficiality and routine of the Parisian music scene. LikeRichard Wagner, Franck wanted to direct the dialogue between composer, performer and audience toward genuine emotional expression under the watchword “je veux être ému”.

Finally, he favored early (religious) music and serious counterpoint as the basis of music education – concepts that were to become central to the program proposed by theSchola Cantorum, founded by Franck-pupilVincent d’Indy.

With his breathtakingorgan playing, highly individual teaching method and the talented students of the ‘bande à Franck’, César Franck has extensively influenced the course of early modern French music history.

Yet it is as a proficient and original composer that he is most fondly remembered today. Franck was a keyboard wizard, thus his compositions for organ and harmonium in particular reflect the technical mastery and the sometimes startling modernity of his musical language.

He also has a true gift for writing wondrous melodies - often jagged yet streamlined, meandering fancifully before reaching their necessary conclusion. Wagner’s ‘unendliche Melodie’ as well as his adventurous, strategic use of harmony served as a great inspiration to Franck, as is clearly portrayed in works such asLes béatitudes,Les Eolides,Le chasseur maudit,Les DjinnsandPsyché.An autograph manuscript of César Franck's "Les Eolides" (public domain, BnF) Furthermore, Franck has written some of the most powerful and lasting chamber music of the early 20th century. His Piano Quintet in F Minor (1879), String Quartet in D Major (1889) and Sonata in A Major for Violin and Piano (1886 - a present for another Belgian,Eugène Ysaÿe) practically fulfil the French dream of a “strong national repertoire” on their own.

Finally, as Franck’s is a style favouring the complex, the motivic and the rhapsodic, it is almost logical that hisSymphony in dstands as one of the most striking examples of cyclic symphonic writing in history.

Marrying the French cyclic form with a German symphonic style, the work remains a favourite with performers and audiences to this day. Never to be forgotten by those who dared to discover, the symphony is a fitting monument to a noble genius and a warm-hearted craftsman, who overturned a troubled youth to embrace international styles and create a musical legacy of lasting importance.

The Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) present music and sound archive collections

**In December, the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) present music and sound archive collections, picked up from the following centres :Centre de recherche en ethnomusicologie(CREM), theCentre de Recherche sur l’Espace Sonore et l’environnement urbain(CRESSON) and from thephonothèque de la Maison Méditerranéenne des Sciences de l’Homme(MMSH).

The CNRS preserves and disseminates field investigations materials produced by researchers in humanities and social sciences. We made a curated selection from collections recordings on fishing or littoral zones issues related to music and singing.

The collectionsSea songs from Val Germanasca, ItalyandVarious Versions of "La batelière"present a particular example of the "sea songs" collected far from the shore.

Indeed, these collections took place in a Waldensian valley of Piedmont, the mountainous Val Germanasca. The recordings were collected in the 1980s, during an investigation carried out jointly by the Department of Ethnology at the University of Siena (Italy) and the Department of Ethnology at the University of Aix-Marseille (France) under the direction of Christian Bromberger, ethnologist.

As the fossils in the mountains are witness of the past geological eras and the ancient presence of the sea, in the same way men and women of these regions retain today some of the maritime presence that they have experienced in their history.

Thus, the story of the old captain who was too old to travel (Adieu mon beau navire au grand mât pavoisé), or the supplication to Neptune, sent by the sailors to the god of the sea to escape the shipwreck (Chants des gens de la mer), are sung here by mountain dwellers, a time emigrated to a more hospitable coast, then returned to their family in Piedmont.

The linguistic analysis of these songs also demonstrates the strong attachment that people living in the valley had to French language. They inherited it from French origin Waldensian communities as resulting from links forged over generations with neighbouring French regions.

These communities give great importance to reading, to the written text and learning the Bible. This is a determining factor that has made possible preservation and transmission of richly sung repertoires. Most people preserve a songbook inherited from their parents. They keep referring to it, even if they know by heart the song they are going to sing....

You can listen to aBerceusethat deals with a mother's fears for her son. Her husband is a fisherman and she is afraid her baby will one day become a sailor, and never come back home. The different versions of the song "la Batelière", still show a deep rooting of these themes in family life.

The CNRS holds many other archives, where the sea is a significant part of everyday life but also of the imagination of the witnesses. The CREM's ethnomusicologists allow us to listen to music, tales, stories coming from different parts of the world and from various times.

Among them, we can listen to a popular fisherman song that was collected during the universal exhibition of Paris in 1900 or a siberian song,Air Traditionnel Des Hommes Nénetz, as well as theDanse des pêcheursrecorded during a field research in Indonesia or theChant de pêcheurs. Puxada de xaréufrom Brazil.

Finally, there are several recordings of sea soundscapes and marine animals. As far as the latter is concerned, CRESSON's sound recordings are also available in Europeana. The Grenoble centre dedicates its research to sound space and the urban environment and keeps several recordings related to the sea. It is up to you to interrogate the archives to listen to the sounds of the sea which are kept there, as one could listen to the ocean murmur in a seashell...

The Seebühne

Palau de la Música Catalana

The Royal Albert Hall

The Odeon of Herodes Atticus

Hellbrunn Palace gardens

15 November is #LoveTheatreDay. So here are five stunning settings to put on your cultural must-visit list. What's your favourite theatre? Tell us@europeanaeuwith#lovetheatreday

First up, The Seebühne. This is a floating stage that gets erected every year for the Bregenz Festival.

It's on Lake Constance in Austria and has 7,000 seats (on dry land). The festival started in 1946 with two barges - one for the set and one for the orchestra, who performed Mozart. The picture below is from 1960 - the first year that ballet became part of the festival.

To Barcelona now and the Palau de la Música Catalana. In 1997, this Art Nouveau building became a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Designed by Lluís Domènech i Montane, for a Catalan choral society, it was built between 1905 and 1908. Look at the intricacy and attention to detail (and the height!) applied to just a corridor - pictured below.

Makes you want to go and see the rest, right? If you're not in Barcelona any time soon, explore the auditorium with avirtual tour.

The Royal Albert Hall in London opened in 1871. The concert hall was designed to promote understanding and appreciation of the Arts and Sciences.

To that end, an almost 250 metre long mosaic circles the building and depicts the advancement of the Arts and Sciences across the world. Explore the history of this building through itsTime Machine!

To Greece now, and almost the oldest theatre in our list: the Odeon of Herodes Atticus, or 'The Herodeon', in Athens.

It was completed in 174 AD, but destroyed and left ruined less than 100 years later by the Heruli - an East Germanic tribe who attacked Greece from the Black Sea. Fast forward to a restoration project in the 1950s and theAthens Festivalwas born. In 2017, the festival saw 114 productions presented in venues across the city.

And finally to our last, and oldest, theatre - and probably one you've never heard of.  A theatre carved by nature out of rock, this location can be tracked down to the gardens of Hellbrunn Palace, Salzburg.

There's no information to be found nowadays about performances here. The park is now home to water gardens with trick fountains!

We invite a guest to write about a musical subject and highlight some of the material on Europeana Music

Each month, we invite a guest to write about a musical subject and highlight some of the material on Europeana Music.

For the month of November, theBibliothèque nationale de France(BnF – National Library of France) presents some sounds of the1931 French colonial exhibitionand makes you travel through time and space with music from Bali, India, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia and Madagascar.

Listen to "Sabat-sabing" played by the musicians below. You can alsoread more details about this recordingon Europeana.

When its gates opened for 6 months in May 1931, the Paris colonial Exhibition was intended to display what was then considered as the positive impact of colonisation, in the political, economic and social areas. In 1931, theMusée de la Parole et du Geste(founded in 1928, following the 1911-foundedArchives de la Parole) was the only institution in France collecting and preserving sound archives.

The idea was born to record a sound anthology benefiting from the fact that a lot of people from the vast French colonies were in Paris for the occasion.

The Anthology would gather tales, songs and music in various languages; taking advantage of the fact that staging the colonies to the public was the promoters’ idea for the Exhibition. However, the Anthology was more grounded in sound and language studies, reflecting also a new interest in world music in 1930s France. TheMusée de la Parole et du Gesterecorded 176 78rpm records of songs, speeches and music during this Exhibition. As it was closely linked to the Paris University, it was a serious scientific undertaking.

Still, there were two underlying motives not so clearly expressed:

In the end, this anthology gives a kind of topography, perhaps of the colonies, but especially of how the West were seeing them: when we listen to the recordings, we hear different types of performers and very different types of repertoires, which reflect the greater or lesser degree of consideration given to those populations.

Among the many countries present at this exhibition, Asia was strongly represented with Bali, India, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia. Two remarks can be made about their music:

Africa was present too. Madagascar allows us to discover some popular music through choir music and valiha, a local zither made of bamboo. Here, it was performed by a professional and well-known orchestra – Mpilalao - that also made recordings for Pathé, Columbia, Gramophone, etc.

In all, there are 21 records with music from Madagascar, making it the best represented culture in the Anthology. Let’s not wait anymore before we hear those recordings of a bygone world.

Making an animated GIF by playing with colours

Today we'll learn how to make an animated GIF by playing with colours. The best material for this kind of GIF will include things that blink or go on-off  such as lights, neon letters.

You could also use images of flowers, geometric shapes, or take a monochromatic image and let only a small part of it change colour.  There are plenty of opportunities - so have some fun and experiment.

To create this kind of GIF, you can use software like Photoshop, GIMP or the web-basedPixlr Editor.

Find an openly licensed image onEuropeanaand download it. Open it in Pixlr Express. You will see it in the sidebar under layers. Duplicate it (right-click -> duplicate layer).

On the duplicated layer, use the lasso tool from the left toolbar to trace around the fragment you want to change the colour of.

Go to 'Adjustment in the upper menu' - use Brightness & Contrast, Hue & Saturation, Color balance & Color vibrance to change the colours.

When you're happy with the new colour, save the newly created image. Upload the original image and your new image toEzgif.Make a GIF. Try different animation speeds and effects like 'crossfade frames' until you're happy with the result. Download your GIF and submit forGIF IT UP.

Exploring the historical origins of Friday 13th superstitions

It happens about twice a year, and when it does, you’d better lock yourself in the house and wait until dawn. Or anything could happen to you. Better safe than sorry!

To help, you could consult this 19th century astrology chart designed to help you work out lucky and unlucky periods. It looks pretty complicated so it’ll probably take you all day to work out whether it’s safe to leave the house. By which point it won’t be Friday 13th any more. Result!

Whether you’re scared of it or not, it is true that there are more car accidents on Friday 13ths than other days. A study from 2002 in the UK showed the risk of transport accidents was increased by as much as 52%. While a 2001 study from Finland discovered a 63% increased risk of death in traffic accidents for women on Friday 13ths. So, don’t get in the car today.

Other things you probably shouldn’t do today, according to legends, include cutting your hair, wearing black, getting married, being born, or going out at night. And if you do (because after all, it’s still Friday), for goodness sake, don’t sit 13 people at your table.

According to Nathaniel Lachenmeyer, in his book13: The World’s Most Popular Superstition, the Friday 13th superstition is relatively recent - it didn’t exist until the early 20th century. Yet now it is the most popular superstition in the world, replacing another 13-related superstition that if 13 people sat a table together, one would die within the year.

Unlucky Friday 13th combines a fear of the number 13 with a fear of Fridays. Both elements of this superstition were inspired by the New Testament.

There were 13 at the table at the Last Supper (see picture below), and Jesus is thought to have been crucified on a Friday. So what’s even unluckier than a regular Friday 13th? A Good Friday 13th. Fortunately, this doesn’t happen much (the next one is in 2063). The addition of the innkeeper in the foreground of this depiction of the Last Supper takes the total number in the picture to 14, but only 13 are seated at the table.

Some people think a black cat crossing your path is lucky. Some say it’s unlucky. But what about a black cat crossing your path on a Friday 13th? That could prove fatal. Well, go to French Lick, Indiana, in the years 1939 and 1942 and you’d be safe - the town board decreed that all black cats must wear bells on Friday 13ths so that residents could avoid them. I’d certainly want to avoid the black cats pictured here howling at naked witches.

In the late 19th century, an elite American group known as ‘The Thirteen Club’, who met routinely on the 13th of the month, sitting 13 at a table, eating 13 courses (see their menu below), in order to face down the spectre of 13, tried to counter the fear of Fridays.

At the time, Fridays were routinely used as the day of the week that executions took place in the US. The Thirteen Club asked judges to execute criminals on other days of the week, and those who did so became honoured guests at their dinners. In 1892, theNew York Timesreported that 'Owing principally to the efforts of the Thirteen Club the execution day has been changed or varied in all States of the Union and thus has, to a great extent, brightened the day.'

So, whilst the Thirteen Club had some success in changing the perception of Fridays being unlucky - now probably one of our favourite days of the week - Friday 13th remains a spine-tingling superstition.

Collections of the recordings of Jewish music and Yiddish theatre

Each month, Europeana Music invites a guest curator to talk about a musical subject and highlight some of the material on Europeana Music. For the month of October,Pekka Gronowpresents theHarry Orvomaa collection of Jewish recordings. Now retired, Pekka was one of the founders of the Finnish Institute for Recorded Sound and adjunct professor of ethnomusicology at the University of Helsinki.



Detail of the recording "Ich fuhr a Heim" sung by Herman Fenigstein, recorded in Warsaw, 1929 (Finnish Institute of Recorded Sound).

Harry Orvomaa (1927 - 1990) was one of the most successful Finnish record producers of the 1960s and 1970s.

His passion for recorded music was fueled by an early interest in traditional jazz and, when he died, he left a large collection of historical 78rpm jazz records to Suomen äänitearkisto, the Finnish Institute for Recorded Sound.

As often happens with archives, the donation lay in storage for many years, until I started cataloguing it a few years ago. To my surprise I found out that the boxes also contained a considerable number of Jewish music on labels such as Syrena and Elesdisc.

This was a field of music where my knowledge was very limited, especially as many of the labels had texts in Yiddish / Hebrew characters. Fortunately I was able to draw on the expertise of specialists in Jewish music, in particular Michael Aylward, whose websiteDer yidisher gramofonis a priceless source of information on early Jewish recordings.

Harry Orvomaa’s family belonged to the small Jewish community in Finland, and his ancestors had come from the Lomza region in Poland. The collection contained, among others, a number of recordings made in Warsaw in the 1920s and 1930s. It was decided to form a separate collection of Harry Orvomaa’s Jewish 78s, and we were even able to add some new donations and exchanges to the collection.

Thanks to a grant from the Kone Foundation, the collection has now been digitised, andparts of it are accessible online on Europeana Music.

A considerable part of historical Jewish recordings consists of religious songs in Hebrew. A hundred years ago Jewish congregations in Europe and America competed for the best cantors, and famous cantors also became popular recording artists.

The cantor Joseph Rosenblatt, who made hundreds of records, was even billed as “the Jewish Caruso”, and listening to his recorded voice makes one believe that he would also have been a big star in opera, if he had chosen that path.

Another large part of the collection presents music from the Yiddish stage in Eastern Europe.

Before the Holocaust, Warsaw, Vilnius, Lvov, Bucharest and many other Eastern European cities had theatres presenting plays, revues and musical shows in Yiddish. Artists from these theatres also made numerous recordings.

They are extremely interesting for the history of European popular music, as many of the performers later on made the transition to the “mainstream” stage in German, English and other languages, and tunes from the Jewish theatre often got a new life with new lyrics. At that time, copyright was not as important as today.

As an example of the recordings in the Orvomaa collection I have chosenIch fuhr a Heim (איך פאָר א הײם), I’m going home, recorded by Herman Fenigstein in Warsaw in 1929. Fenigstein made a number of recordings for the Syrena label.

Fenigstein was a member of the Jewish “literary-artistic troupe”Sambatiyon, founded in Vilnius in 1926. The group soon relocated to Warsaw, where they appeared until the end of 1929. On the label of the recording made in 1929, Fenigstein is already billed as an artist from Kaminski’s Jewish Theatre. This probably refers to the well-known theatrical company organized by the actressIda Kaminska.

I have not able to find more information on the artist. In cataloguing the Orvomaa collection, I discovered that I had stumbled on one of the white spots on the map of discography. Most countries today have a national sound archive, and at least some discographies or literature on recorded history, but there does not seem to be any archive in Europe that systematically documents and collects Jewish recordings before the Holocaust. However, websites such as Europeana, which bring together documents from many sources, will hopefully one day create a virtual archive of all European recordings.

Истраживање судбине српских војника из Првог светског рата који су преминули у Холандији

Guest blog by Fabian & Tatjana Vendrig (also available Serbian language version below)

In a corner of the Dutch Reformed cemetery in Garderen, on the edge of the forested area of the Veluwe region in the Netherlands, stands a monument to the memory of Serbs who died of the Spanish flu in 1919, in the aftermath of the First World War. The monument contains 29 names of soldiers who died in Garderen, 21 soldiers who died in Nijmegen and 14 who died in Enschede, but whose coffins, as it was found out in 2012, are no longer in the Netherlands.

A team consisting of two Dutch and one Serbian were determined to find out what happened to those Serbian soldiers who had died in the Netherlands, which was a neutral country during the First World War.

They wanted to know how they arrived in the Netherlands, where their remains are now and if possible to find the families of those Serbian First World War soldiers.



After researching the Dutch municipal archives they discovered that not only had 64 Serbian soldiers died in three municipalities in the Netherlands, but also 91 in 10 different towns.

With the help of the Serbian community in Rotterdam and Utrecht, the Serbian embassies in The Hague and Prague and various persons and sources in the Netherlands, Serbia and the Czech Republic they found more answers to their questions. When they contacted the first descendants of some of those 91 soldiers more questions arose, but also more information became available.

In the Yugoslav archives in Belgrade (Serbia), the researchers came to know via documents that the remains of 88 Serbian WWI who died in the Netherlands were transferred on 18 May 1938 to a mausoleum in Jindřichovice, Czech Republic.

During WWI the village was called Heinrischgrün and was a part of the Austro-Hungarian empire. It was here where there was an Austrian PoW camp located during WWI, which held a lot of Serbian and Russian PoWs besides Italians and other nationalities. Until 1940, the remains of 7470 Serbs and 189 Russians found their last resting place here.



At the end of 2012 the first descendants of those 91 soldiers were found.

Most of the descendants did not know that their distant family members died in the Netherlands and that they found their last resting place in Jindřichovice. Nevertheless, some of them knew, like for example the great-granddaughter of Djordje Vukosavljevic (born in Kragujevac, Serbia).

The researchers were happy that she shared the letters and pictures of her great- grandfather, which she keeps carefully. She knew Djordje died in the Netherlands, but she did not know that his remains were in Jindřichovice.

Here you can read an extract of a letter he wrote on 30 June 1918 from most probably Soltau (Germany):

Dear Lepa, if you don’t get my letters soon, you have to know that I am not alive any more. I’d rather die than wander around as a blind person. A blind man doesn’t work in the mine. If I escape from here, I will inform you. I just feel sorry that I still haven’t got your and children’s photo, in order to see Ružica as well. Dear Lepa, hereby I am sending you 25 marks. Buy children what they want, let them know it is from their father.

Djordje was a non-commissioned officer of the Serbian army during the First World War and he died 22th January 1919 in a PoW camp in Nieuw-Milligen near Garderen. He never returned to his home country Serbia and he never saw his beloved wife and children again.



The researchers are determined to trace more families than the 10 already found and to find more information about the fate of those unfortunate Serbian WWI soldiers who died in the Netherlands far away from their home country.

На углу холандског реформисаног гробља у Гардерену, тик уз шумовит предео Велуве регије у Холандији, стоји споменик у знак сећања на Србе који су преминули од шпанске грознице 1919. године непосредно после Првог светског рата. На споменику је исписано 29 имена војника који су умрли у Гардерену, 21 име војника који су преминули у Најмејгену и њих 14 у Еншадеу, али како се испоставило 2012. године они више нису били ту сахрањени. Трочлани тим, два Холанђанина и једна Српкиња, је био одлучан у намери да сазна шта се десило са тим српским војницима који су преминули у Холандији, која је била неутрална земља током Првог светског рата. Они су желели да сазнају како су ти војници стигли у Холандију, где су сада њихови земни остаци и уколико је могуће да пронађу њихове потомке.

По истраживању холандских општинских архива они су открили да нису само 64 српска војника преминула у три општине у Холандији већ укупно њих 91 у различитим градовима. Захваљујући помоћи српске заједнице у Ротердаму и Утрехту, српских амбасада у Хагу и Прагу и разним другим особама и изворима у Холандији, Србији и Чешкој Републици, ова три истраживача су дошла до више одговара на њихова питања. Када су контактирали прве потомке од неких од 91 војника, појавило се још више питања, али је и још више информација постало доступно.

У Архиву Југославије у Београду истраживачи су дошли до сазнања да су посмртни остаци 88 српских војника преминулих у Холандији транспортовани 18. маја 1938. године у маузолеј у Јиндриховице у Чешку. Током Првог светског рата ово село се звало Хајнрихсгрин и било је део Аустроугарске. Управо овде се налазио аустријски логор, а у коме се поред италијанских и војника других националности налазило пуно српских и руских ратних заробљеника. До 1940. године, ово место је постало почивалиште за посмртне остатке 7470 Срба и 189 Руса.

Крајем 2012. године први потомци ових 91 војника су били пронађени. Већина потомака није знало да су њихови предаци преминули у Холандији и да су последње коначиште пронашли у Јиндриховицама. Ипак неки од њих су знали, као на пример праунука Ђорђа Вукосављевић (рођеног у Крагујевцу, Србији). Ова три истраживача су била срећна што је она поделила писма и фотографије њеног прадеде са њима, писма која она брижно чува. Она је знала да је Ђорђе преминуо у Холандији, али није знала да су његови посмртни остаци у Јиндриховицама.

Овде можете прочитати део из писма које је Ђорђе написао својој супрузи 30. јуна 1918. године вероватно из Солтауа, Немачке:

Драга Лепа, ако не добијеш скоро моја писма, знај да нисам више жив. Јер волијем и умрети сада него доцније слеп ићи по свету. Ћорав човек не ради у руднику. Ако се избавим одавде јавићу ти. Само ми је жао што још нисам добио слику дечију и твоју, да бих могао видети и Ружицу. Драга Лепа, ево ти данас шаљем (25) двадесет и пет марака. Купи деци што оћеду, нека знаду да им је од оца а нарочито Ружица која ме још не зна као и ја њу.

Ђорђе је био подофицир српске војске током Првог светског рата и преминуо је 22. јануара 1919. године у логору у Нив Милигену, близу Гардерена. Никада се није вратио у своју домовину и више никада није видео своју вољену супругу и децу.

Осим 10 војника чије су потомке пронашли, истраживачи су одлучни да пронађу још породица и да дођу до још више информација у вези са судбином ових несрећних српских војника који су умрли у Холандији, далеко од своје домовине.

Every month, Europeana Music invites a guest curator to look at a particular area of music. This month, our guest is Greg Markus from Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision.

The everyday sounds are the ones that soundtrack our lives and have simply since humans developed ears and the capacity to listen.

Europeana offers thousands of visitors the unique opportunity to explore Europe’s sound heritage through music dating back a century. However, for this month, we’re curating sounds that once filled the Netherlands’ sonic environment and showcasing how artists are transforming them into new musical masterpieces as part of theNetherlands Institute for Sound and Vision’sRE:VIVEinitiative.

For artists that sample sounds mold them into new creations some of the most prized audio content are environmental field recordings. They not only have serendipitous moments that exist only in that place at that time, they also offer vast amounts of sonic range from 20 to 20,000khz. This sonic range presents countless opportunities to warp, stretch, splice, cut and explore.

Sounds like the those of machine rooms, road traffic, and even a washing machine might sound like the least musical thing to a normal person but for a musician it is a world of wonders like a sculpture getting a slate of marble and chiseling away to create a whole new world.

Mechanical field recordings also offer the opportunity to bring sounds otherwise impossible to recreate in a recording studio into music. For instance, the sounds from the Port of Rotterdam, Europe’s busiest port where the groans of of heavy machinery and wails from ship horns dominant the day-to-day sonic landscape. These sounds define the city and their power is a great way to capture an emotion a human and their instrument could ever amass.

Lastly, what these environmental field recordings and sounds offer is the capturing of specific historic moments and legacies that are now lost or forgotten.

For instance, these recordings from Amsterdam’s Huis van Bewaring, a massive prison that once stood next to Leidseplein are the remaining echoes of human incarceration in a place that is now a tourist hot spot. Using sounds from the Huis van Bewaring not only provide cataclysmic reverb but equally provide an emotional weight that carries over to the artist's’ approach to music.

John Tophamwas a British documentary photographer who captured a changing Britain. Today, PHOTOCONSORTIUM'sFred Truyenintroduces us to Topham’sLover’s Lane, 1938.

Today, John Topham’s collections are managed by the British picture libraryTopFoto. My friend John Balean, who works there, did some research and found a print of this image with a caption reading 'A young couple head for Lovers Lane but only find a dead end to the Swanscombe Paper Mill – 23 March 1938'.

In that era, this area of North Kent was rapidly evolving as a consequence of the industrialisation process. The work of John Topham depicting this region is a testimony both to a lost rural world and to industrial prowess. So there is some ambiguity in this choice of subject.

Lovers Lane, 1938. John Topham. TopFoto. In copyright.

When showing this image (which is part of PHOTOCONSORTIUM’s travelling exhibitionAll our Yesterdays), I’m always struck by the reaction of younger members of the audience. They all have the same question: why on earth is this young couple venturing into a filthy industrial zone for a supposedly romantic walk?

Times and perceptions have changed, evidently. While we are very sensitive to pollution today, this wasn’t the case in the late 1930s.

Industry meant progress, bread on the table, a steady income, a future for the children and the power to keep rival nations at bay – which would prove a grim necessity only a few years later.

Besides this changed perception of what would be the ideal decorum for a romantic walk, another aspect is bound to strike today’s spectators: the strong gender coding of the depicted couple. Here we have a strong man, bristling with self-confidence, seemingly in control of things as he oversees the Thames river. His neat suit puts him at the winning end of society, expressing success and accomplishment.

What a difference with the way in which his female companion is depicted! At best, she’s not an obstruction to her partner, and no more than a subdued accessory to the powerful scene. Her posture is static, supportive, almost rigid compared to the dynamic body language of her partner.

This image is not a contemporary one, for sure, and this aspect of the scene clearly puts it in a different era!  That doesn’t make it anything less than brilliant though - for the above reasons and many others too, such as the balanced implementation of the rule of thirds, the superb composition, the play with contrasts to highlight the main topic, etc. I hope you like it as much as I do!

Europeana Photography, our latest thematic collection, features over 2 million images from the first 100 years of photography. The collection is curated byPhotoconsortiumand today Fred Truyen, Antonella Fresa and Sofie Taes share their personal reflections on photography and their hopes for the collection.

From its beginning, photography has pushed boundaries. Technical and technological boundaries, for one: continuous advancements of a chemical, physical, and mechanical nature have enabled cameras to capture the world with increasing quality and detail. Never before could reality be documented with such a sense of authenticity and nearness.

On an artistic and aesthetic level as well, photographic images have opened up new possibilities and directions. In an unremitting dialogue with the visual arts, photography at first augured to become the most effective tool of artists in pursuit of realism, but quickly revealed its creative, imaginative powers: by adapting lighting or exposure, adding color or using specific lenses, photographers proved able to transform a seemingly ordinary representation of everyday life into an ingenious work of art - in its turn inspiring and invigorating painters and sculptors.

Photography has made geographic borders fade: images from exotic destinations have brought faraway places palpably close, while homely pictures and portraits of loved ones became powerful antidotes to melancholy and nostalgia.

To photography we owe a broader view and deeper knowledge of physical reality too: as early as the mid-19th century, photomicrography exposed elements invisible to the naked eye.

From the second half of the 19th century onwards, images taken from hot-air balloons stimulated a panoramic worldview, while - starting in the 1920s - colored underwater photos uncovered a whole new realm of nature. Photographs have not only erased boundaries of space, but also of time: images can erase breaches in family history, fix damaged or lost memories, bring the past into the present or take us way back.

In all its capacities and throughout history, photography has built bridges between nations and individuals: by showing life as it is or was, showcasing people’s characteristics and idiosyncrasies, pictures highlight apparent differences, but lay bare common foundations as well.

In dealing with life’s joys and sorrows, all men turn out much alike. We hope that you’ll join us in experiencing this slice of Europe’s cultural heritage as a celebration of our shared (hi)stories, as an ode to the accomplishments of photography and – most of all – as an inspirational hub for countless hours of joyful browsing!

Scandal in Warsaw

In this guest post for Europeana's Art Nouveau season, Dr. Piotr Kopszak, Curator at the National Museum of Warsaw, tells us about the artist Władysław Podkowiński and the scandal surrounding his paintingSzał(Frenzy).

Stylistic change has always fascinated art historians and it is often difficult to pinpoint the precise moment when change occurs.

However, this is not the case with the birth of Art Nouveau in Poland, known asmodernizmorMłoda Polska‘Young Poland’. The eruption of Young Poland took place when a painting entitledSzał(Frenzy) by the Warsaw artist Władysław Podkowiński was exhibited in the city’s Zachęta gallery on 18 March 1894.

The monumental composition ofFrenzydepicts a naked woman seating on an agitated black horse, clinging onto its neck as the animal bares its teeth and flares its nostrils. Her eyes are shut and her abundant hair blends with the horse's mane.

The painting’s display was met with an atmosphere of scandal and sensation, lending it public notoriety. On the first day of the exhibition, a thousand people saw it; in the first month, twelve thousand. The painting itself was a scandal but the artist himself decided to end its exhibition with one more.

On the morning of 23 April 1894, Podkowiński entered the Zachęta gallery, asked for a ladder and, in front of stunned gallery visitors, slashed the painting with a knife.

Later accounts differ in their portrayal of Podkowiński‘s mood: some say that he was entirely calm, whilst others say he was "possessed by a demon of destruction".

This dramatic event took place less than a year before the artist’s death at the age of just 28. In addition to its lurid subject matter, contemporary gossip whispered thatFrenzythat it referred to Podkowiński's romance with one of Warsaw’s aristocratic ladies, despite a firm denial from the parties concerned.

The painting's exhibition developed into a media event, particularly after Podkowiński gave interviews to the press describing his emotions when he slashed the the painting. One might speculate that this sequence of events had in fact been set up deliberately. The idea of artistic scandal would surely not have been unfamiliar to Podkowiński, whose earlier work such asLadies at BilliardsandThe Dance of Skeletonshad flirted with controversial subjects.

Contemporary coverage in the Warsaw Courier, 1894. University of Warsaw Library.

The scandal surroundingFrenzyobscured important aspects of the painting, such as its link to iconographic tradition going back to the Middle Ages. Unusual as it was,Frenzywas not without parallels elsewhere in the arts. Its proto-expressionist character was very much in tune with contemporary developments in Polish literature and poetry.

A group of Polish writers later called ‘Without Doctrine’, in reference to Henryk Sienkiewicz’s bookWithout Dogma, began, in tune with rising interest in neurosis in America and Europe, to explore the domain of unbalanced emotional life. A fascination with neurotic states is visible in many other works and themes of decadence were emerging in the work of Polish poets such as Lange, Przesmycki, Kasprowicz and others. A Warsaw art critic, discussing Podkowiński’s earlier Impressionist works, called Impressionism "decadent colourism", thereby making a connection to literature.

It’s no wonder that the exhibition ofFrenzybecame such a turning point in Polish art.

One of the Art Nouveau highlights of the 1900 World’s Fair in Paris were the architectural ceramics of French manufacturer Alexandre Bigot. Housed in a pavilion designed by Jules Lavirotte, and awarded a Grand Prix, the remarkable ensemble was bought at the Fair by the Museum of Applied Arts in Budapest. In the second of two guest posts, Gabriella Balla, Curator of Glass and Ceramics, tells the story of the 1900 World’s Fair pavilion and its subsequent journey to Budapest.

The Bigot Pavilion at the 1900 World’s Fair and its journey to Budapest Photographs of the 1900 Exposition Universelle (World’s Fair) pavilion, designed by architectJules Lavirotte(1864-1924), show that it was comprised of many types of decorative architectural stoneware: a columned portico surmounted by an elaborate cornice; a life-size window facade for a house, complete with columns supporting a balustrade; lintels, floor and wall tiles, and a staircase railing.

Most of the architectural elements used in the pavilion assembled for the Fair were designed for two buildings by Lavirotte (which are still standing in the seventh district of Paris). The entrance gate to the Fair was also decorated with a decorative frieze by Bigot, elements of which were also reproduced for the pavilion.

At the Fair itself, the Museum of Applied Arts acquired an outstanding collection of objects (primarily works of French Art Nouveau) selected by its Director Jenő Radisics. The most expensive purchase was Bigot and Lavirotte’s pavilion. The production cost alone of its elements was estimated to be 20,000 francs. After bargaining, the purchase price was reduced to 5000 francs. The representative of the museum in France, Louis Delamarre-Didot, was instrumental in arranging the purchase.

As the building of the Museum of Applied Arts, completed in 1896, is a prime example for the use of architectural ceramics in Hungary, it is natural that Bigot’s technical innovations drew Radisics’s interest.

The total weight of the Bigot pavilion was 12,680 kilograms, therefore its transportation required considerable organisation. The pavilion elements were dismantled in November 1900 and the ensemble was sent to Budapest by train on 13 December 1901. Two days later, Radisics informed the Bigot company in writing that all the ceramics had arrived intact.

The purchase of the Bigot Pavilion in its entirety was perhaps the greatest feat of Jenő Radisics’s long tenure as Director of the museum.

From the time of its purchase until recently, only discrete elements of the Bigot acquisition had ever been displayed in Budapest. This changed in 2013 when the acquisition was exhibited in its entirety at an exhibition dedicated to Bigot.

Further examples of Bigot’s architectural ceramics can be seen online in thecollections databaseof the Museum of Applied Arts, as well as inEuropeana.

Alexandre Bigot(1862-1927) established a ceramics factory at Mer in 1894, after his extensive studies of the natural sciences, chemistry and physics, and with his enthusiasm for Far Eastern and and modern ceramics.

Bigot’s factory produced stoneware fired at high temperatures, known asgrès flammés. This material was particularly suitable for the decoration and panelling of the facades of modern ferro-concrete buildings, but the company also made various dishes and vases. The surface of the ceramics was usually covered with special glazes, including crystalline glazes, which often flowed down on the surface of the plastic forms. He also created special matte glazes, using acids to corrode the surface. In its heyday, the Bigot factory employed around one hundred and fifty workers.

The extensive range of products made by the Bigot factory was listed in their catalogue, issued in second edition in 1902.

They offered frost-resisting glazed and unglazed tiles for façade revetments, roof tiles, including ridge-tiles of various shapes, as well as large variety of architectural sculpture, such as columns, pillars, lunettes, lintels, banisters, arches, friezes and parapets.

Ceramics for interior use were also quite varied. Flat tiles for floors and walls were often designed with multi-tile ornaments of various shapes. Their ceramics, which were suitable for decorating large surfaces, fireplaces and ornamental vessels, were made for the elegant urban interiors of the bourgeoisie.

Bigot’s elegant, finely shaped objects were decorated with a variety of figurative and floral motifs, wrapped in warm, colourful glazes. Similar pieces to the ones in the Museum of Applied Arts can be found on the facades of several Parisian apartment buildings and palaces. The architectural ceramics of Alexandre Bigot were made in various historical styles as well as in the style of Art Nouveau, but he never really constrained himself to one style.

For Bigot, the principal challenge was the material and the glazes. The magic of his ceramic objects lies in the glazes which cover daring and exotic shapes, sometimes flowing downwards, at other times appearing in deep tones or gleaming in thick layers.

In part two of this post, published next Monday, Gabriella Balla will continue the story of the 1900 World’s Fair pavilion and its subsequent journey to Budapest.

In this guest post for Art Nouveau season, Friederike Fankhänel of theMuseum für Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg(MKG) introduces a fascinating new web journal about the innovators ofJugendstil(Art Nouveau).

The Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg (MKG) holds the widest collection of Art Nouveau artworks within German-speaking countries. As founding director Justus Brinckmann made extensive acquisitions at theExposition Universellein Paris in 1900, the Art Nouveau collection can be seen as the keystone for what is now a museum covering 4000 years of human creativity.

While the MKG’s galleries presents objects, furniture and interiors by Art Nouveau artists, our new web journal aims to frame the art style in its historical context and tells the story behind our renowned collection.

Bewegte Jahre – Auf den Spuren der Visionäreis the travel diary of Christian Heller, a fictional young journalist from Hamburg, written over a time span of nearly 20 years from 1897-1916.



On his travels, Heller meets important artists and designers - both male and female - of the movement and documents their visions for a new society. After a coffee over painting philosophy with Gustav Klimt, he finds himself on the couch of Sigmund Freud before heading to an exhibition at the Viennese Secession. He’s riding on the moving boardwalk to Samuel Bing’s galleryL’Art Nouveauin the Paris of 1900 and strolls the World Fair with Justus Brinckmann.



In Uccle, he gets fascinated by Maria Sèthe, wife of Henry van de Velde, and her interest in the social ideas of Arts and Crafts pioneers Jane Burden and William Morris. Back in Vienna, the young man learns how Emilie Flöge, Koloman Moser, Ditha Mautner-Markhof and Josef Hofmann abolish the traditional division of art, architecture, design, fashion - and life.

Up north in Glasgow, Margaret MacDonald and Charles Rennie Mackintosh share the same spirit. Costume parties with the artist couple are leading Heller to a vegetarian retreat among the “first hippies” on Monte Verità in Ascona before he plans to settle down in his hometown, which in the meantime is competing with New York City.



Thanks to the institution’s digital collectionMKG Sammlung Online, we can not only link to over 200 artworks but also choose from 4300 photographs, from 1890-1920, to illustrate city life back then in Hamburg. With most of these images dedicated to the Public Domain, we encourage the reader to get creative by labeling the works “for your re-use”.

According to theCRPD, we set a special focus on accessibility: the journal includes an audio version, image description for screen-readers, an introduction in German sign language and several options to visually adjust the content display.

Each month,Europeana Musicexamines a particular theme from the world of music. For the month of July , Gabriele Fröschl from theÖsterreichische Mediathektakes a look at the character of Don Juan as portrayed in Mozart's opera and elsewhere.

The legend of Don Juan is one of the most famous stories in European cultural history. The story of the unscrupulous seducer has challenged various authors to deal with. It was also the source for the opera “Don Giovanni”, which became one of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s most famous works which in turn was an inspiration for many other literary works.

At the beginning of the literary engagement with the myth was the Spaniard Tirso de Molina (actually Gabriel Tellez, 1584-1648) with his dramatic adaptation of Don Juan in "The Seducer of Seville and the Stone Guest".

He was followed by writers like Jean-Baptiste Moliere, E.T.A. Hoffmann, Nikolaus Lenau, George Gordon Byron, Ödön von Horvath, Max Frisch, Peter Handke and many others.

Dealing with the personality of Don Juan is always a reflection of the spirit of the age: Tirso de Molina's Juan confesses before his hellish journey whereas about hundred years later Moliere's Juan refuses any repentance.

"Il dissoluto punito o sia Il Don Giovanni" was the second collaboration of Mozart with his librettist Lorenzo da Ponte. The work on the opera lasted until immediately before the premiere - the overture was only finished hours before - and on October 29, 1787 the opera was performed in the Gräflich Nostitz National Theatre in Prague (later Royal Theatre of the Estates) for the first time. In Prague, it was immediately an overwhelming success, whereas in Vienna it took some time before the opera was accepted by the audience.

There are numerous psychological interpretations of the drama and of the opera as well, the last ones often with regard to Mozart's own biography.

The overpowering father figure of the stone commander in Don Giovanni was often related to the father-son relationship of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and his father Leopold Mozart, who died a few months before the premiere on May 28, 1787. Leopold Mozart indeed was a dominant father figure that played an important role in the artistic development of his son.

Not only Don Juan, but also Mozart's opera became the centre of literary works. In "Don Juan" (1813), a novel of the German writer E. T. A. Hoffmann, the operatic plot and the description of the visit to the theatre flow into one another, and, in a romantic tradition, the destiny of the operatic figures is interwoven with that of the actress and the listener. In Eduard Mörike's novel "Mozart on the journey to Prague" (1856), the premiere of Don Giovanni is the occasion for a very personal portrait of the composer.

"The myth of Don Juan" is part of an online exhibition hosted by Österreichische Mediathek:www.mediathek.at/virtuelles-museum/mozart/mythos-don-juan-1787/

In this week's Art Nouveau season guest post, Andreia Lourenço of Portugal'sAveiro City Museumtakes us on a guided tour of Aveiro’s finest Art Nouveau buildings. Along the way, she highlights the characteristic elements of Arte Nova (Art Nouveau) in Aveiro, particularly its focus on architectural ornament, and introduces us to important local landmarks.

The first appearance ofArte Nova(Art Nouveau) buildings in Aveiro dates from the beginning of the 20th century. The style became very popular between 1904 and 1920, with the construction of many such “new style” houses being reported in the local newspapers. Art Nouveau style was imported into Aveiro by a conservative bourgeoisie and wealthy emigrants to Brazil who, upon returning to Portugal, wished to publicly express their social and economical power.

Art Nouveau was adapted to local tastes and was mostly deployed on the façades of buildings, while the rest of the construction and interiors followed a conservative structure and decoration. A special characteristic of Art Nouveau in Aveiro is the use and production of tiles with Art Nouveau motifs. These tiles were often the only Art Nouveau element present in a building.

Tiles were common in traditional Portuguese construction because they were affordable to the general public. In Aveiro, the use of tiles also provided waterproofing and enabled the embellishment of houses built in adobe (sun-dried clay bricks). Tiles with sinuous floral motifs were very sought after and these were produced locally in the Fonte Nova Factory.

Aveiro’s Art Nouveau Museum is the perfect place to start exploring the city’s Art Nouveau heritage. The museum has two highly decorated façades and is right in the city center, in front of the main canal. The interior of the museum preserves original tiles and also features a wrought-iron staircase, rich in flowing floral motifs.

After visiting the museum, we recommend walking along one of the area’s most animated streets, Tenente Resende St, where the Ferro Guesthouse can be observed. A former woodwork workshop, the guesthouse was designed byFrancisco Augusto Silva Rocha(1864-1957) between 1909 and 1910.

The façade is decorated with two medallions bearing images of the tools used in the atelier as well as floral elements, over which the words Honor and Labor are inscribed, bearing witness to its origin. Silva Rocha was the most influential architect in Aveiro’s Art Nouveau movement and many buildings are attributed to him.

In the foreground are the typical Aveiro boats, called moliceiros, used to transport seagrasses. Photo: Patrícia Sarrico. From here, you can walk to the Rossio waterfront and enjoy the striking façade of the Former Cooperativa Agrícola. The combination of the hand-painted tiles representing lilies and its masonry sets it apart. The tiles were hand-painted by Licínio Pinto, a celebrated local artist, and were produced in the popular Fonte Nova Factory in 1913.

From here, you can continue to the Glória neighbourhood and visit the João Jacinto Magalhães Foundation or even walk to the municipal park and find an Art Nouveau gazebo, an example of intricate iron-work, where concerts were held during the 1900s. Beyond the regular route, the Central Cemetery can also be a point of interest, with its crypts with Art Nouveau decoration and a funerary statue with an original combination of Art Nouveau and Gothic influences, called The Last Breath.

After the route, you can always return to the Art Nouveau Museum to rest and enjoy the environment of the museum’s tea room, inspired by 1900s style. If you enjoyed this post, why not check out ourArt Nouveau exhibition?

In today's Art Nouveau season guest post, Francesc Quílez, Curator of Prints and Drawings at theMuseu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya, describes how commercial artists at the turn of the 20th century adoptedmodernisme(Art Nouveau) to create vibrant advertising images.

At the turn of the 20th century, a public fascination with machines and modern transport, linked to concepts of technological progress, was vividly reflected in advertising of the era.

Many of the posters held in the Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya’s collection take travel and motion as their subject, depicting bicycles, cars, ships and aeroplanes.

Artists like Georges Gaudy (1872-1940) and William Henry Bradley (1801-1857) subtly incorporated stylistic elements of Art Nouveau (known asmodernismein Catalonia) into their commercial work, using floral motifs, bold outlines and areas of pure colour. Sporting themes were common on posters of the era, which depicted sports clubs and public events such as motor races and sailing regattas. The poster images are often highly aspirational, reflecting the fashion, wealth and social status of the growing bourgeoisie.

The arrival of the automobile generated a range of reactions. Poster artists sometimes viewed the car with an ironic and suspicious gaze, depicting contemporary automobiles as if they were infernal machines. To convey the sensation of speed, artists used a visual language that their audience would have been familiar with from illustrated newspapers, magazines and cartoons of the period.

Advertising posters, with their striking typography and bold colours, were received with great enthusiasm as a popular new art form. Catalan graphic art, exemplified by the works of Alexandre de Riquer and Ramon Casas, embraced the new visual opportunities of the modern age and contributed to its popular iconography. In particular, Casas is renowned for creating two of the era’s most emblematic posters, which became popular icons of modern Barcelona.

Conceived as mere amusements and associated with the decoration of the bar Els Quatre Gats,Ramon Casas and Pere Romeuon a tandem and its four-wheeled counterpartRamon Casas and Pere Romeu in an automobileare elegant subversions of the hierarchy between fine art painting and the poster. Few works better sum up the fertile opportunities that modern advertising's arrival presented to Catalan artists.

"Winterreise" ("Winter's Journey") is a song cycle by Austrian composer Franz Schubert. It was written towards the very end of his life, and evokes the beginning of spring or, more accurately, the end of winter.

The very last song of Schubert's song cycle is "Der Leiermann" ("The hurdy-gurdy man"). In the song, the narrator describes an old man, ignored by everyone, who never stops turning the wheel of his hurdy-gurdy.

The narrator asks himself if this hurdy-gurdy is the accompaniment to his own life: alienated and unchanging. At the beginning of the song, you can hear that thepiano accompaniment provides an imitation of the hurdy-gurdy: in reality this is a droning sound, made by rotating a wheel against a string.

There are many examples of hurdy-gurdys in Europeana Music and you can see acurated gallery of them here. We also have different recordings of Schubert's song cycle and different versions of the sheet music; and, also, there are manydepictions in artof the hurdy-gurdy player, who is often a blind beggar such as in David Vinckboon's painting below.

In today's Art Nouveau season guest post, Marie Vítková of theNational Museum in Praguetells us how Alphonse Mucha made his artistic breakthrough.

In December 1894, the famous actress Sarah Bernhardt called the Parisian lithographers Lemerciers, asking for a new poster design for the playGismonda.

She wanted something different than what Lemerciers had produced before and she wanted it as soon as possible. Bernhardt understood the power of effective advertising to drive ticket sales and grow theatre audiences. Faced with Bernhardt’s urgent request, Lemerciers’s head of manufacturing was placed in some difficulty.

Fortunately, though, there was an artist from Moravia in the next room working on some graphic corrections for a friend. 'Can you do it?' asked the workshop manager.

Alphonse Mucha accepted the challenge. The next day, he visited the theatre and began work. Soon after, Mucha presented a new design proposal for the poster, depicting Sarah Bernhardt as a Byzantine princess with palm leaf on golden background.

Sarah Bernhardt was delighted with the design and Mucha’s stellar career as the Parisian 'King of Art Nouveau' began.

The poster was printed more than 4000 times and Paris fell in love with Mucha’s distinctive style. According to historians, many Parisians actually removed the posters from public places and kept them as interior decoration.

Mucha’s poster forGismondalaunched a new chapter of graphic style. After its success, Mucha collaborated with Sarah Bernhardt on advertising material, jewellery and theatrical costumes.

Alphonse Mucha was born in the small Moravian town of Ivancice in 1860.

He loved painting and drawing and his first artistic job was designing decorations for a Moravian theatre company. Mucha spent some time in Vienna and Mikulov before – thanks to his sponsor Count Karl Khuen Belassi von Mikulov – he enrolled for formal training at the Munich Academy of Fine Arts.

In 1887, Mucha traveled to Paris to continued his artistic education. He got a job at the magazineLa Costume au Théâtreas an illustrator and he established his own studio in the city centre. At this time, Mucha met Paul Gauguin and, after Gauguin returned from Tahiti in 1893, they shared a studio.

The influence of Mucha‘s work was amplified by the rise of advertising during the period. Mucha created many advertisements for clients including the biscuit firm Lefèvre-Utile and the champagne company Ruinart Père et Fils.

All of them had the Mucha signature elements: women with long curly hair as the main motif (some of Mucha’s critics used to call the hair 'macaroni'), flowery decor and soft colours, especially gold. Despite the fame and wealth that Mucha’s commercial work brought him, he preferred to see his work as being personal, spiritual and national. Mucha asserted himself as an artist capable of more than just Art Nouveau style and in his later career he focused more on personal projects.

In this week's Art Nouveau season guest post, Júlia Katona, Head of Collection at Budapest'sSchola Graphidis Art Collection, highlights the importance of graphic arts within Art Nouveau and describes how Hungarian artists were inspired by native folk culture.

The Schola Graphidis Art Collection is the museum collection of Hungary’s oldest national art education institution, founded in 1778, and its successors. It conserves, collects, studies and presents all the fine arts, applied arts and technical collections associated with these historic schools.

After the cavalcade of historical styles seen in art during the second half of the 19th century, Art Nouveau brought something extraordinarily new. Its leading artists, architects and designers broke from tradition and sought fresh inspiration in the inexhaustible forms of nature. Art Nouveau quickly reached an international audience through the publication of periodicals.

In particular, graphic artists showcased their work in albums of high-quality chromolithographs. These albums demonstrated how floral and animal forms could be applied to the decorative arts.

The best-known of these publications were executed by the Swiss-born decorative artistEugène Samuel Grasset(1845-1917) and his pupils, and by one of Grasset’s disciples,Maurice Pillard Verneuil(1869-1942).

These albums were studied not only in Europe’s fine art and architecture colleges, but also in industrial drawing schools across the continent. Their influence extended across Europe’s major cities, including Vienna and Budapest (then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire).

This explains why the Schola Graphidis Art Collection, the modern successor of the Budapest Metropolitan Industrial Drawing School (1886–1945), has such a remarkable collection of 19th-century pattern books and ornamental prints.

Art Nouveau artists in central Europe looked to native folk traditions to express their distinctive national cultures in new ways. In Hungary, many artists and art teachers collected and published motifs from Hungarian folk art.

One of them was the professor and director of the Hungarian Royal School of Applied Arts,István Gróh.

In 1904, Gróh published a series of prints made using the technique of chromolithography entitled Hungarian Ornamental Motifs (Magyar stilusú rajzminták). This album contained ornamental motifs drawn from 17th–19th century folk objects, including furniture designs, textiles, carved gates, ceramics, mirror frames, leather works, stoves and painted ceilings of village churches.

In parallel, the publication presented new Art Nouveau motifs influenced by Hungarian folk art, by the pupils of István Gróh, like Ödön Faragó, Pál Horti, Aladár Buday, Aladár Stiasny, Lajos Pátzay and Lajos Protivinszky. Both the drawings after the original folk objects, and the new designs, display typical features of Art Nouveau: the proliferation of curving lines, the dominance of floral ornaments, and the gracefulness of undulating lines.

In the everyday practice of Hungarian art education, western European ornamental prints (typically from France, Germany and England) were used alongside Hungarian publications. This is why the Schola Graphidis Art Collection contains western European pattern books and locally published works from the 19th century and the turn of the century.

Its reference library specialised in educational books on the industrial arts which form part of the rare book collection today. Plaster casts from the 19th century, as well as antique bookbinding and furniture making tools, are also unique parts of the collection.

This week's guest post for our Art Nouveau season comes from Lukáš Štepanovský of the Slovak National Gallery in Bratislava.

The regional variations of Art Nouveau, known asSezessionin Slovak, around Europe were marked and diverse.

At that time, the territory of today's Slovakia was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Despite being a crossroads of cultures in a geographical sense, Austria-Hungary had a very provincial political status and an underdeveloped art school tradition.

Europe’s principal art academies were situated in cities like Prague, Munich and Paris, and many talented Slovak artists chose to stay on after their studies, such asViktor Oskar Tilgnerin Vienna andAlojz Stróblin Budapest.

The Slovak towns Pressburg (today's Bratislava), Komárno, Detva and Košice represented regional artistic hubs, centred around private art schools like the Karol Harmos school in Komárno, and artistic groups like thePressburger Kunstverein, which brought European influences to the local art scene.

The wider adoption of Art Nouveau, however, was hindered by the conservative tastes of the Slovak public, who preferred more traditional 19th century styles.

Art Nouveau in Slovak art was characterised by subtle stylistic elements taken from Impressionism, Symbolism and Luminism. Beyond its influence on colour and tone, light was often used as a decorative and thematic element in itself, creating less representational and more mystical works.

The contemporary fascination withTheosophyresulted in many artworks containing melancholic figures lost in thought, focused on their inner world. Landscapes sometimes used unusual colour hues and strange weather effects to create peculiar, otherworldly atmospheres, as in Ladislav Mednyánszky’sPraying over the Gravefrom around 1895.

Mednyánszky (1852-1919) was one of the most important and prolific Slovak masters working at the turn of the century. He combined diverse European art influences with an interest in Eastern philosophy and a particular empathy for his subjects. Although an avid painter of native realist subjects, such as poverty and disease, Mednyánszky also sought to convey the inner worlds of his characters.

Martin Benka (1888-1971), called “the alchemist of Slovak beauty” by his contemporaries, was the founder of a nationally oriented school of painting.

Before becoming a well-known figure on the Slovak art scene, Benka studied under the Czech artist Alois Kalvoda and inherited some of his teacher's inclination towards Art Nouveau and Impressionist styles. Benka’s atmospheric and unusually coloured early landscapes were complemented by scenes of Slovak folk interiors.

In these almost cozy works we can see a hint of Art Nouveau arabesque and a "calligraphic" gesture, indicating a fascination with the folklore, which stayed with the artist well into his later endeavours.

Konštantín Kövári-Kačmarik (1882-1916) was a singular artist who diligently worked to advance Art Nouveau forward in Košice, before the city became an interwar centre of Slovak Modernism. His views of the city’s streets, corners and courtyards used light and colour as decorative elements.

Kövári-Kačmarik’s art represents a bridge between Art Nouveau and Symbolism, and his work was crucial to the later development of Slovak Modernism.

Anton Jasusch (1882-1965) also worked in Košice and employed elements of Art Nouveau style in the period before the outbreak of the First World War. After being drafted into the army, injured on the eastern front and captured, Jasusch was cut off from the mainstream of European art trends.

On returning home, Jasusch retreated into isolation and produced the series of large canvases which are today seen as his masterpieces. Channelling his war trauma into apocalyptic visions of swirling colour and world-crushing momentum, Jasusch elevated his gestural detail and vibrant hues above mere decoration. These intensely dynamic and almost Futurist compositions have no equivalent in Slovak art before or since.

Ask someone to name five artists and responses are likely to include famous European names such as Picasso, van Gogh, Monet, da Vinci — all male artists. Ask them to name five women artists, and the question poses more of a challenge. Last year, in honour of Women’s History Month, theNational Museum of Women in the Artslaunched a social media campaign asking just that, addressing the gender imbalance in how art is presented, assuring great women artists a place of honour now and in the future. To answer this question, we've selected artwork by five female artists to highlight a small selection of important and significant artists from across Europe and throughout history.

Anna Maria van Schurmanwas a 17th century German-born Dutch artist known for paintings and engravings. In 1636 she studied at Utrecht University, becoming the first female university student of Europe. In addition to her visual art, Schurman was a poet and scholar and was proficient in 14 languages.

Danish artistAnna Ancheris regarded as one of the Denmark’s most important Impressionists. She was born in 1859 in Skagen, Denmark’s northernmost and remotest region, and studied drawing in Copenhagen and Paris. After marrying fellow artist Michael Ancher in 1880, Anna continued to paint the landscapes and people of Skagen, defying the convention that married women should devote themselves to household duties.

Rosalba Carriera, a Venetian Rococo painter who lived between 1673 and 1757, is known for her portraits. Initially painting miniatures for the lids of snuff-boxes, her work later evolved into portrait-painting, for which she pioneered the exclusive use of pastel. She went on to paint portraits of nobility and royalty across Europe.

Berthe Morisotwas a Impressionist painter in 19th century France who portrayed a wide range of subjects, from landscapes and still lifes, to domestic scenes and portraits. Although married to the artist Eugène Manet, she chose to exhibit under her maiden name instead of using a pseudonym or her married name.

ArtistNatalia Goncharovawas a painter, costume designer, writer, illustrator and set designer. Born in Russia in 1881, she was a major artist of the Russia avant-garde movement in the early 1900s. As a designer she was notable for her set and costume creations for ballet and theatre, particularly in Paris where she moved in 1921 and lived until her death in 1962.

Today's Art Nouveau season guest post from one of the world's leading collections of glass, Düsseldorf’sGlasmuseum Hentrich. Dr. Dedo von Kerssenbrock-Krosigk introduces us to the innovative collector Gerda Koepff (1919–2006), whose bequest of Art Nouveau glass is an important part of the museum’s collection today.

Art Nouveau plays a particularly strong role within the collections of the Glasmuseum Hentrich, which forms part of the Museum Kunstpalast in Düsseldorf.

The museum owes this speciality to the donation and bequest of two private collections of outstanding quality: the Helmut Hentrich collection (after which the museum itself is named) and the Gerda Koepff collection.

French art glass of the Art Nouveau period is a fascinating topic for collectors. From the late 1870s, an important change took place in the Paris sale rooms of François Eugène Rousseau (1827–1890), in the glass factories of Emile Gallé (1846–1904) and the Daum brothers in Nancy, and in many glass workshops throughout Lorraine and the Ile de France.

Until then, glass had been used for practical objects, even if at times highly luxurious ones; now, it came to be seen as a splendid medium for artistic expression. While retaining some of its utilitarian function in the shape of vases, bowls and dishes, Art Nouveau glassware gradually became an art form in its own right.

Gerda Koepff, née Stoess (1919–2006), was born into a family of industrialists in Eberbach, near Heidelberg in south-western Germany. Her elder brother Harald Stoess was killed in action in World War II and she took his place in the family company.

She became the company’s executive director from 1960 until 1975, and continued to oversee the firm successfully until her 80th birthday. It seems that Gerda Koepff’s interest in art glass art of the Art Nouveau period was not a family inheritance. Her parents’ generation had grown up during the heyday of Art Nouveau and had witnessed its decline into mass-produced and unimaginative objects.

In the 1960s, when Koepff began acquiring Art Nouveau glassware, progressive German households were typically furnished with modernist objects and decoration. Gerda Koepff thus started to build her collection against the zeitgeist.

Koepff developed an eye for quality decades before collecting Art Nouveau became popular – and expensive. Initially, she merely intended to decorate the living room of her new home. Soon, however, her interest became deeper and more refined as she began to perceive the differences in quality and execution. Koepff’s discernment is particularly apparent in her interest in Daum glass.

As early as 1968, she found the prevailing contempt for this company’s products entirely unjustified, and she proved her point by purchasing several Daum masterpieces, which form a major part of her collection today.

The Koepff collection reflects the collector’s personal taste and eye. It does not have a rigid structure or principle, and while the focus is on French Art Nouveau, Gerda Koepff never aimed for completeness in an academic sense.

It contains a range of artists and manufacturers, but above all, it is a personal selection of individual pieces. The vases, plates and bowls in her collection tell us about poetry, symbolism, a love of nature and the continuous expansion of the limits of glass. “At some point,” she said in an interview, “I had the feeling of having reached the end; the collection had a look. And that was where I wanted to stop.”

Today's Art Nouveau season guest post comes from Anne-Lise Alleaume ofRéseau Art Nouveau Network

What you call Art Nouveau depends on where you come from: it could beJugendstil,Glasgow Style,Sezessionstil,Nieuwe Kunst,Stile Liberty,Modernisme,Ecole de Nancyor other names.

Every European centre of Art Nouveau had its own name and character, influenced by local culture, history and materials. When it emerged in the late 19th century, Art Nouveau was driven by a particular set of aesthetic ideals and an enthusiasm for modernity.

It exploited the possibilities offered by new industrial technologies and materials, combining an aspiration to beauty with meticulous craftsmanship. The result was a wonderful concordance of architecture, furniture, and decoration.

The advent of the First World War hastened the decline of Art Nouveau, which became the target of strong criticism and general disinterest. Although many Art Nouveau masterpieces are recognised today, just as many remarkable examples remain unknown to the public and subject to scant protection.

For these reasons, a European network was established to protect and promote Art Nouveau heritage. In 1999, the Brussels-Capital Region took the initiative to identify and connect with iconic Art Nouveau cities (Barcelona, Nancy, Glasgow, Budapest, Helsinki, Ljubljana, Nancy, Palermo, Riga, Vienna) around a common programme of activities. Together these cities obtained funding from the European Commission for the foundation of a network.

Eighteen years later, theRéseau Art Nouveau Network(RANN) has become an association of more than twenty institutions representing cities or regions with significant Art Nouveau heritage. The Network also includes cities with less celebrated, but noteworthy, Art Nouveau character such as Terrassa, Darmstadt and Aveiro.

In recent years, the Network has extended into towns in central Europe and the Balkans like Oradea, Subotica and Szeged. Regardless of Network members’ diverse backgrounds, they share the conviction that the pooling of best practice and research at European level is essential to the effective preservation and promotion of our Art Nouveau heritage.

Thanks to the support of the European Commission, RANN has been able to develop collaborative research projects and to deliver many public events. Since 2001, a series of discrete projects has focussed on different aspects of Art Nouveau, such its socio-economic context and on the link between Art Nouveau and ecology.

The Network hosts conference events for professionals, educational activities for young people, bilateral exchanges of good practices between members and travelling exhibitions.

Having been mounted in fourteen member cities, the exhibitionThe Nature of Art Nouveauis now on at the Darvas La Roche House in Oradea and the Palacio del Secundo Cabo in La Habana. Every year on 10 June, RANN organises Art Nouveau World Day which includes public activities like photo competitions.

This month, we take a look at musical instruments of Africa. These are well represented onEuropeana Music, thanks to the wide and varied records fromMusical Instrument Museums Online(MIMO).

This blog gives just a glimpse into some of the different types of instruments that can be found in Africa.

This type of instrument consists of a board upon which strong but flexible keys (or lamellae) are mounted. These keys are plucked causing a twanging sound, rather like twanging a ruler held over the edge of a table.

There are so many varieties of lamellaphone: the lamellae can be made of cane, or various types of metal that have been hammered out. The lamellae can be tuned in different ways, or mounted to the board in different ways. The resonator can be a wooden box, or a hollowed-out gourd, or even a tortoise shell.

The mbira dza vadzimu, from Zimbabwe shown here, is one of the most well-known lamellaphone. Other types are called the kalimba, ilimba, lulimba and lukembe.

These beautiful instruments are called arched harps because of the shape of the string bearer – unlike the orchestral there isn’t a supporting pillar.

The shape of the instrument can vary greatly, sometimes a simple boat shape, sometimes ornately carved and decorated, in the shape of an animal or a person. One type of arched harp is the ennanga from Uganda which you can see here. You can alsohear the ennanga being played hereon Europeana Collections.

Please take a moment to explore some of the other types of instruments onEuropean Music– the koras, which have two sets of strings passing over a raised bridge, the many types of drums throughout the region, the lyres and, finally, the marimbas, balafons and xylophones.

A lost World War I memorial plaque - dedicated to fireman Thomas McGarry who died in the sinking of the HMS Laurentic in 1917 - has been returned to his family decades later thanks to Europeana 1914-1918.

Thomas McGarry was a fireman on board the HMS Laurentic which sunk while travelling from Ireland to Canada when it struck two mines off the coast of Donegal on 25 January 1917. McGarry was among the 354 passengers and crew who died in the sinking of the ship.

Decades later, a bronze memorial plaque bearing Thomas McGarry's name was dug up in a garden by Tom Murphy, an Irish champion pole-vaulter, in Limerick.

Memorial plaques (also known as a Dead Man’s Penny or a Widow’s Penny) were issued to the next-of-kin of all service personnel who were killed in World War One. In 2013, Killian Downing, Tom Murphy's grandson, researched the plaque andshared the story on Europeana 1914-1918, our digital archive for World War I stories and items.

Thomas McGarry's grandchildren - now based in Ireland, the UK and Australia - discovered the story. They contacted Killian, who was able to return the plaque to them last weekend, just days away from the centenary of the ship's sinking.

Thomas McGarry's body was never recovered after the sinking, so the return of this plaque to his descendants is very meaningful and tangible for them.

Killian Downing says, 'After having the pleasure of meeting this family, to return the memorial plaque of their grandfather, I really understood the importance of sharing and discovering archives and their stories online. The Europeana 1914-1918 project allowed me to do this, and I hope it continues!'

An exhibition dedicated to the Laurentic will be held at theTower Museum in Derryon 25 January, to be accompanied by a series of local events and commemoration services held in both Donegal cemeteries. Items recovered from the shipwreck during many dives will be on public show during the exhibition.

How anthropology is linked with sounds and music studies

Our music blog this month is focused on anthropology and its links with sounds and music studies, in France and in the world.

Ethnomusicologists seek to understand what is music and its purpose. In order to study the cultural and social aspects of musicians, they need to collect field recordings.

You can explore the work of ethnomusicologists through four of the CNRS’ sound collections. Two collections are provided by theMMSH sound archive center, which holds pluridisciplinary field recordings collections focused on the Mediterranean area:

A collection ofSongs from South of Francesung in a variety of languages: Occitan, French, Italian and Italian dialects.

And a selection ofSongs from South of Saharain Arabic, Tamahaq and Tamasheq.

MMSH sound archives centre also offers to browseviolinmakers storytellingswho show the technical gestures to build a violin, a cello, a bridge or a bow and how was the violinmakers life at the beginning of the 20th century until today.

Soundscapes are also essential to understand the links between different spaces and how the sound environment is perceived and produced. TheCRESSON collectionexposes this pluridisciplinary approach and focuses on the sound dimension from the scale of architectural device, housing, district, to the scale of sound identity of cities. Listen to the extract”Ambiance port de Lesconil”.

The Phonobase collection will also be on Europeana, and will offer you a trip in the past.www.phonobase.orggathers 10,000 sound excerpts and photos taken from early cylinders and records produced from 1888 to 1920 approximately, and distributed in France and Europe.

As a reliable witness, these sources provide a new lighting on the Belle Époque and the soundscape of our ancestors.

This month’s Collection will give you access to theaudio archives of the CNRS – Musée de l’Homme, which are dedicated to the ethnomusicology: you will find field recordings of music and oral traditions from all around the world, from 1900 to present.

The CNRS will provide recordings collected during the Mission Ogooue Congo from July to December 1946, with special records of Pygmy music. After that mission in Central Africa, Gilbert Rouget, a French ethnomusicologist, came back with an exceptional collection of 600 field recordings on lacquer disc.

Exploring artworks representing theatre, stages, plays and audiences

William Shakespeare may have written that all the world's a stage, but today on#LoveTheatreDay, all Europeana is a stage.

We've searched our collections to find artworks and photographs which give a glimpse into theatrical life over several hundred years. Whether indoor or outdoors, the theatre is a place where imagination and creativity reign.

The players, either professional or amateur, enthrall an audience with feats, some daring and some more mundane.

Around the plays and productions, artistic endeavour flourishes, evidenced by posters such as these byDudley HardyandJules Cheret

And some artists remind us that sometimes the real drama and beauty happens in the audience as well as on stage.

--------------------------------------------------

If someone is asked today, which operas of Antonio Salieri they know, most will not come up with an answer, which is not surprising. The operas of Salieri had already started vanishing from stage even before the composer’s death in 1825 and are hardly shown today.

Nevertheless, during his lifetime Salieri was a very prolific composer of opera.

He wrote around 40 operas and 36 of them were performed during his lifetime. He was known for them all through Europe, and they were quite successful in Vienna as well as in London, Prague, Warsaw, Lisbon, Milan and Paris.

Although there has been quite a lot of research in the last decades concerning Salieri, most people know him as Mozart’s opponent or even murderer. This cliché was also strengthened by the release of the famous film “Amadeus” in 1984.

No doubt - Salieri and Mozart were musical rivals. An occurrence which probably inspired them both unto a certain degree. But whether they really tried to harm each other’s career is simply unknown.

Antonio Salieri was born in Legnago in 1750. He was taken to Vienna as the protégé of Florian Leopold Gassmann, who met him in Venice in 1766 and who immediately recognized his musical talent.

In Vienna, Salieri received a thorough musical education and made the acquaintance of very important people such as Emperor Joseph II, the librettist Pietro Metastasio, the composer Christoph Willibald Gluck and many more, who positively influenced his career.

Throughout his life, Salieri always stayed strongly connected with Vienna, personally and professionally. His wife was Viennese and Salieri was madeHofkapellmeister(Director of Music for the Court) in 1788, a post he held for 36 years until his retirement in 1824.

Concerning his operas, Salieri preferred to work with new texts which means a lot of the librettos he used had never before been set to music. Furthermore, he  had the habit of revising all of his operas even after they had been performed or known for several years.

He never considered them finished but more as 'work in progress', because time, taste, setting and his own musical development might have changed.

His best-known and most-played works were the ones he edited the most.

The first of Salieri’s operas ever to appear on stage was the opera buffaLe donne letteratein 1770, based on a libretto by Boccherini, which was originally intended for Leopold Gassmann. Salieri’s opera represents the style of Viennese operas during this time, but also already gives a glimpse towards the direction in which Salieri’s operas would develop. He wrote several more opere buffe before turning his attention to more serious matters withArmidain 1771.

A couple of years later in 1774, when he was 24 years old, he was appointed, in succession of Gassmann, to the post ofKammermusikkomponist(Composer of Chamber Music) and was also made music director of the Italian opera.

Shortly afterwards the focus in Vienna switched from opera to spoken theatre and from Italian to German. Salieri therefore dedicated his time to writing mostly comical operas for theatres in Italy. The most successful one wasLa scuola de’ gelosiin 1779, which made him known throughout Europe.

The beginning of “La scuola de' gelosi” by Antonio Salieri(Mus.Hs.16615/1-2 Mus), Libretto by Caterino Mazzolà, Österreichische Nationalbibliothek, Public Domain

Salieri only wrote two German operas (or 'Singspiel'). One wasDer Rauchfangkehrerin 1781 on behalf of Joseph II and the other was his very last operaDie Neger, which he wrote 24 years later in 1804. The 'German Era' did not last very long though and Italian comic opera was back on stage in 1783.

The beginning of the first scene of the first act of "Der Rauchfangkehrer" by Antonio Salieri(Mus.Hs.1611 Mus), Libretto by Leopold Auenbrugger, Österreichische Nationalbibliothek, Public Domain.

From 1782 onwards, Salieri wrote several French operas to be performed in Paris, which was only stopped by the French revolution.

Nevertheless, for a time being he replaced the late Christoph Willibald Gluck as operatic authority in Paris. His first French opera wasLes Danaidesin 1884 which was so successful, that he was commissioned immediately to write two more operas. His biggest success wasTartarein 1786 on a libretto by Pierre Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais, which even appeared in an Italian version in Vienna in 1788. There it was calledAxur re d’Ormus. The libretto was written by Lorenzo da Ponte and slightly modified. Between 1788 and 1805, the opera was staged 100 times in the Viennese court theatres.

After his appointment to Hofkapellmeister in 1788, Salieri was more involved in administrative tasks and started also devoting himself more to the composition of church music.

Between 1790 and 1804 he wrote 9 more operas which were actually performed during his lifetime. The premiere of his last operaDie Negerwas performed on the 10 November 1804 and the piece was not well received. Of those last nine operas,Palmira regina di Persiawas by far the most successful.

The beginning of  “Palmira, regina di Persia”(Mus.Hs.16183/1-2 Mus), Libretto by Giovanni De Gamerra, Österreichische Nationalbibliothek, Public Domain.

After 1804, Salieri did not write any more operas.

As an old man – probably in 1822 – reflecting on his life he made a lot of annotations in his autographs and finished some of his works. John Rice put it in his book like that 'Often written with a shaky hand, these didactic and often superficial remarks show an old-artistic teacher looking back proudly, but also self-critically, at his life’s work'. (Rice, 1998, 7)

Salieri always took great care of his musical scores throughout his life.The Austrian National Libraryhas one of the most extensive collections of operatic autographs from the 18th century. This collection is now also accessible throughEuropeana.

Notation can be seen as the foundation of the creative output in classical music.

Music autographs, manuscripts and sketches manage to give an insight into the composer’s mind and a glimpse to his way of thinking. They open up an understanding of how musical ideas were created and expressed.

Within Europeana’s music collections a lot of interesting music manuscripts and scores from several institutions can be found. Therefore this month, we concentrate mainly on music manuscripts with a focus on Antonio Salieri.

Antonio Salieri (PORT_00154575_02), Austrian National Library, Public Domain.

Antonio Salieri was a well-known composer in the 18th century and the Hofkapellmeister at the Viennese court for 36 years, from 1788 until 1824, a year before his death in 1825.

Salieri had the habit of always seeing his operas as “work in progress” and continued making revision even after they were first performed: This can be seen from his manuscripts, which are also shown in the first Search Entry Point. Since Antonio Salieri did not only write operas, but attended to almost all common genres during his lifetime. So you can also explore all his other works, like masses, oratorios, various instrumental and vocal music like concertos, sonatas, arias and more.

A very famous contemporary of Antonio Salieri and one of the most known composers throughout the world is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, to whom the second Search Entry Points is dedicated.

The Anton Bruckner collection of the Austrian National Library contains a large number of autographs, manuscripts, sketches and documents of the composer himself and is the world largest Bruckner archive containing his works.

Bruckner himself started this collection when he left the autographs of his main works to the former Viennese Hofbibliothek (Imperial Library). Since then the collection has been steadily increased.



In those two pages from the first movement of Bruckner’s 8th Symphonie, you can see on the left page how he crossed out a four bar long passage writing “bleibt weg” (omitted). On the right page – how Bruckner revised and changed parts of the score.

The fifth Search Entry Points is dedicated to two Austrian composers: Hugo Wolf and Alban Berg. Hugo Wolf is especially known for his songs and his autographs. Drafts of his greatest works can now be found within the music collections.

Alban Berg was a pupil of Arnold Schönberg and part of the second Viennese school. Especially the manuscripts of his operas Lulu and Wozzek are worth exploring.



The beginning of the Hugo Wolf song “Daß doch gemalt all deine Reize warden” (Would that thy charms were painted) of the Italian Song Book.

Apart from musical manuscripts one may also find personal items of composers in music collections. In the sixth Search Entry Points you can therefore browse f.e. through letters of Johannes Brahms, Hugo Wolf or Anton Bruckner, or you can take a look at documents, pocket diaries or personal notes of various classical composers.

Considering the children of World War I

What Europe’s children went through during the First World War is often overlooked by historians. Understandably, perhaps, if they are focusing on ‘big’ issues like the horrors of trench warfare or the changing role of women on the home front. But what was the First World War like for Europe’s smallest citizens? How many children spent their formative years fearing for their fathers’ lives? Or caring for their little brothers and sisters while their mothers worked in munitions factories?

Few children can have been left unmarked by what they experienced during the First World War, particularly if their fathers were soldiers. We at The Army Children Archive (TACA) [http://www.archhistory.co.uk] set up ‘The Army Children of the First World War’ project [http://bit.ly/ArmyChildrenFWW] to shine a spotlight on these children using two online collections of images: ‘The Army Children of the First World War:Faces and Families’ collection, which focuses on photographs of the children of British soldiers; while ‘The Army Children of the First World War: aSentimental View’ collection presents postcards featuring children generally.

Since 2014, we have been adding an image to both of these collections every week, as well as to Europeana 1914–1918 [http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en\]. There are now over three hundred images available to view, and looking at them both individually and collectively provides viewers with some fascinating insights into national and personal attitudes and experiences during the First World War. They say that a picture is worth a thousand words, and it is hard not to feel a pang of pity when looking at the apprehensive face of the little girl posing with her unsmiling soldier–father and solemn mother in this photograph.A Royal Artilleryman's family,The Army Children Archive, CC-BY-SA

She, like most of the children in our ‘The Army Children of the First World War: Faces and Families’ collection, is nameless, and one of the reasons why we are sharing our photographs online is in the hope that someone will recognise these faces and tell us more about them. In most cases, all that we know for sure about the children in the photographs is that their father was a soldier in the British Army – we know this because he is pictured wearing his uniform. There are other interesting types of photographs in this collection. By combining separate photographs of children and their soldier–fathers, for instance, one type graphically illustrates how the First World War forced families apart.

Was this because they were keen to copy their soldier–fathers, or to display their patriotism – or both? A few show children wearing real items of soldiers’ uniform and kit.

Some of the commercial photographic images in ‘The Army Children of the First World War: a Sentimental View’ collection also feature children dressed as soldiers, often with captions stating that they are ‘following in father’s footsteps’.Following in Father's footsteps, The Army Children Archive, CC-BY-SA

First World War picture postcards are often especially interesting because they illustrate people’s wartime concerns. So we can clearly see that the sadness of being separated from their fathers at the front darkened many British children’s lives.

And how many of them, encouraged by their mothers, must have prayed for their soldier–father’s safety before going to bed at night?For my Daddy, The Army Children Archive, CC-BY-SA

A significant number of British postcards featuring children were produced for propaganda and patriotic purposes. Some are explicitly anti-German.Less whallop for us, The Army Children Archive, CC-BY-SA

The aim of others – often enlisting childish cuteness – was obviously to encourage men to join the army.I'd love to!, The Army Children Archive, CC-BY-SA

And yet another category aimed to inspire women and girls on the home front to ‘do their bit’ for their country, maybe by knitting socks for soldiers.Knitting on the home front for soldiers at the front, The Army Children Archive, CC-BY-SA

The artist and photographers who created these images placed children in many kinds of situations and scenes – humorous, sad and warlike, to name just a few – to send their ‘government-approved’ messages. One of the joys of Europeana 1914–1918 is that organisations and individuals of many nationalities have contributed such a wide variety of items. Both of my grandfathers served as young soldiers in the First World War: one in the British Army, the other in the German Army, making them enemies.

That’s one of the reasons why I find comparing the British and German additions to Europeana 1914–1918 especially interesting. Take, for example, the family photograph from 1915 contributed by Helmut Blank, of German soldier Georg Grether with his wife, Bertha, and their daughter, Martha.



Georg Grether - Desert or fight?, The Army Children Archive, CC-BY-SA

It is strikingly similar to many equivalent British images, underlining how war must have affected European families in the same ways, whatever their nationality. (And I was saddened to read that little Martha’s father was killed in June 1918.) Just as in British postcards, German children, too, are portrayed praying for, or thinking about, their absent soldier–fathers.

German First World War postcards also often depict children wearing military uniforms to encourage men to join the army, and the German people to support their soldiers.

Other postcards show us ways in which the war affected German children: some must often have gone to bed hungry, for instance.

These are just some examples of the images featuring children that you can view on Europeana 1914–1918, and some of the reasons why they can be so informative and thought-provoking. Do take a look at the treasures showcased there, and please spare a thought for the children of the First World War.

While visiting the various regions of France, one might wonder what he might have heard in those places a century ago.

Ferdinand Brunot, the founder of the Archives of the Spoken Word, embarked on three recording tours in 1912 and 1913.

Between June and July of 1912, Brunot and his assistant Charles Bruneau toured the Ardennes region of France and Belgium in an automobile. They visited 35 villages and returned to Paris with 166 recordings (oral testimonies, dialogues, folk tales and songs).

In June 1913, Brunot visited the Berry region of central France, collecting material about the late author George Sand. Finally, in August of 1913, he toured the Limousin region, producing 72 phonograph recordings. Listen toLe vingt-cinq de décembre, je me suis t'engagéregistered by Ferdinand Brunot in 1913.

Later,Roger Dévigne, Director of thePhonothèque nationalefrom its creation in 1938 until 1953, followed Brunot's idea of phonographic linguistic map.

He organised several sound recording missions: in the Provençal Alps in 1939, in Languedoc-Roussillon Pyrenees in 1941-1942, in Normandy and Vendée in 1946, leaving us precious testimony of local traditions.

Those recordings are now part of the National Library of France’s collections. They are carefully preserved and stored. They have been restaured, digitised and made available online throughGallicaand, more recently, throughEuropeana Sounds.

The past still resonates today… Let’s rediscover this precious heritage together.

During the European Heritage Days, the National Library of France organises, as part of theEuropeana Sounds project, a big public event.

On Sunday 18 September, we will gather to listen to some traditional French music recorded in 1913 and in 1946. Pascal Cordereix, Head of the sound archives service at the Audiovisual Department of the BnF will present the recordings, BnF’s sound collections and their dissemination via the Europeana Sounds project. Then, singers specialised in traditional music will take the floor to reinterpret those same recordings. For more information about this event please visitthe Europeana Sounds website.

Among the great many cultural connections between Ireland and Scotland, the mutual influence of each nation’s musical and singing traditions on the other is perhaps one of the most interesting. As a case in point, below are some archival examples which point to the legacy of people travelling back and forward between the two countries, and the songs they took with them.

The geographical closeness of north-east of Ireland to the south-west of Scotland provides one obvious conduit through which people and their songs have migrated.

When the famous Antrim song collector Sam Henry journeyed across the Straits of Moyle to Argyll in the early 20th century to see what song connections there might be, he found a fine example in Archibald McEachran’s ‘_Thatchers of Glenrae_’, which tells the story of an Irish labourer coming to Kintyre for seasonal work. McEachran, of Kilblaan, had learned the song from a friend, who himself had learned it from the author, a man from Ballycastle in Antrim. Alex MacShannon of Campbeltown sings a version on Tobar an Dualchais:

As a return gift, Sam Henry taught Archibald McEachran ‘_The Blazing Star of Drung_’ – a love song from County Cavan, probably very similar to this version performed by Denis McDaid of Inishowen, which comes from the Irish Traditional Music Archive:

As the song then passed through oral tradition in Argyll, the name ‘_Drung_’ was localised to refer to ‘_Drum_’ in Kintyre, where the modified song entered the singing of the MacShannon family. James MacShannon, brother of Alex, sings the Kintyre version below:

As shown in the ‘_Thatchers of Glenrae_’, work being such a common reason for people to travel meant that their songs could end up entering oral tradition far away from their origins. Indeed, it’s believed as many as a third of the songs collected by Gavin Greig and James Duncan in the North-East of Scotland at the start of the 20th century were Irish in origin, possibly transported by Irish navvies building the extensive new local rail network in the previous century. ‘_The Ould Bog Hole_’, sung here by John Strachan of Fyvie, may be one such example:

It’s interesting to note that some songs, having taken root far from home, lived on in their new locations while they passed from memory back where they originated. Such an example is the Scottish bothy ballad ‘_Falkirk Fair_’, sung here by Mickey McDaid, which may well have been brought back to Ireland by a farm worker:

Ireland and its people were themselves such popular themes among song lovers in Scotland that many such supposed Irish songs may actually have been composed in Scotland for domestic consumption. See for example ‘_Free and Easy to Jog Along_’, whose earliest versions appear as song slips sold in the streets of Scotland’s cities; this version is sung by Jimmy Hutchison of Fife:

The Travelling peoples of both Ireland and Scotland have also contributed much to exchanges of music by sojourning in either country. The famous Stewart family of Blairgowrie have many fine Irish songs in their repertoire, learned while living and working in Ireland:

A final word should go to highlighting the many excellent contemporary Scottish and Irish tradition bearers who have adopted their neighbouring country as their home. By way of example are two of Ireland’s finest singers, Cathal McConnell of Fermanagh and Kevin Mitchell of Derry, who have for many years lived in Edinburgh and Glasgow respectively.

These are merely a few indicators of the many strands of social and musical life that connect Scotland and Ireland, but the archives from which the above examples are drawn offer the listener many more fine examples.

What was the role of music in fair days and festivals in Ireland?

Irish people are often noted for their friendliness and sociability. We relish the opportunity to get together, chat, sing, dance, make music and enjoy ourselves. This is not a modern phenomenon but rather one that is deeply rooted in our history.

While the Ancient Olympics were taking place in Greece, gatherings such as Aonach Carman in Wexford and Aonach Tailteann in Meath were happening in Ireland.

References to annual gatherings can be found throughout the Irish literary tradition.

'Long ago there was a great fair held on Pollan Green twice a year, the twenty-ninth of June and the tenth of October. The last fair was held there on St Peter and Paul’s Day in the year of 1812. Before that it had been going on for hundreds of years….From all accounts it must have been the greatest fair, maybe, in the whole north of Ireland. The people gathered from all airts and parts, and the green was black with people and standings and play-actors of all kinds. It was a cattle, horse and sheep fair, but there was great drinking and dancing and singing carried on, too. All the mentioned girls of the three parishes were there, and many a match and wedding was settled at the same fair of Pollan'

The last of the name(1986), Charles McGlinchey

These ‘fair-days’ also played an important economic role in rural Ireland. Some of the more famous fair days were Puck Fair in Killorglin, County Kerry, which continues to this day, and Donnybrook Fair in Dublin.

Those living in the rural hinterland would travel to the fairs not only to trade but also to meet up with friends and relations. At such events, the voices of ballad sheet sellers would be heard, singing songs about the political and social events of the day.

The songAonach Bhearna na Gaoithe('The fair at Windy-Gap') describes in detail the ‘shenanigans’ of the fair day.

At 'Wind-gap Fair' I witnessed thereAll sorts of fun and pleasureWe’d music sweet to shake our feetAnd sport beyond all measureSpoileen, pig’s head and gingerbreadFor hungry folk to eat thereWith brandy fine, strong ale and wineAnd whiskey (sure) to treat there

Nice “sugarstick” for boys to lickAnd tempting cones of honeyWith raisins sweet, and chicken-meatTo coax the youngster’s moneyAll kinds of game, fowls, wild and tameFed pampered folk and sinfulWhile seasoned broth poor people boughtFor sixpence they’d a skinful

Wool, tow, and flax, with cards in packsFine lots of “Irish beavers”And brogues galore decked with five-scoreOf “crabbit-heads” or “pavers”Those “up to snuff” may find enoughTo suit the proudest nose thereOr smoke and drink until they winkThen end their spree in blows there

On hardware stalls were razors, awlsKnives, forks, tin-cans and kettlesWith pans and pots in sorted lotsAnd various kinds of metalsThere tents, two score, were quilted o’erWith blankets, sheets and friezesWhile dairy-ware in piles were thereThe kind good housewife prizes.

Translation by M.Cavanagh from the Irish of Thomas MoranFrom The Gaelic Journal,vol. 3, no 26 (1887)

There was also a seasonal element to gatherings and the year was punctuated by annual events. One of the most famous of these is the mummers, or Christmas Rhymers, also known as wren-boys or straw-boys.

Traditionally they appeared on St Stephen’s Day, as the 26 December is known in Ireland, but also on other days throughout the year.

Traditions varied from parish to parish but there was always an element of music and dance, dressing up and a rhyming chant that told stories of local and political events. The group roamed from house to house, performing at each stop. Mumming is currently enjoying a revival in Ireland.

Irish traditional music continues to serve as a focal point for gatherings.

Most towns can boast regular informal sessions and the yearly calendar is filled with weekend festivals across the island. Two of the largest Summer festivals are theWillie Clancy Summer SchoolandFleadh Cheoil na hÉireann.

Both events feature classes with well-known performers and days and nights of non-stop music, song and dance. The Fleadh also hosts competitions for all age groups. The first Fleadh Cheoil na hÉireann was held in Monaghan in 1952 and has grown in popularity since then.

The 2016 Fleadh Cheoil will be held in August in Ennis, County Clare.

Internationally Ireland is synonymous with the 17 of March, the feast day of its patron Saint Patrick.

On this day in towns and villages around Ireland, and indeed in many cities worldwide, parades are held and Irish culture is celebrated. This is another long-standing tradition, as can be seen from the description of St. Patrick’s Day in New York in this 19th century ballad sheet.

‘St Patrick’s Day’ is also the title of a traditional step dance, danced for us here by Céline Tubridy with music from Michael Tubridy, recorded at the aforementioned Willie Clancy Summer School in 2004.

Vintage photography from the summer Olympic Games

The 2016 Olympic Games came to a close last night in Rio de Janeiro with an energetic closing ceremony.

2016's Games saw history being made. Teams such as Puerto Rico, Singapore and Bahrain won their first gold medals. New World and Olympic records were set, and many athletes achieved personal bests.

Cultural heritage collections across Europe feature manyOlympic Games stories, so we have selected phtoography showing 8 moments from Olympic history.

The first modern Olympic Games were held in 1986 in Athens, Greece. In this photograph, we see spectators in a rural landscape watching the marathon race.

This photograph also comes from the 1896 Athens Olympic Games.

It shows German Jewish gymnast Alfred Flatow during a routine in the Panathinaiko Stadium. Flatlow was a champion in 1896, winning gold in the parallel bars competition and silver in the horizontal bar competition. He was also a member of the German team that won the parallel bars and horizontal bar events.

The 1912 Olympic Games were held in Stockholm, Sweden and were the first to include swimming and diving competitions for women.

This photograph shows the Great Britain team who won the 4 x 100m relay swimming race. The team was made up of Jennie Fletcher, Belle Moore, Annie Speirs and Irene Steer.

The first ever individual gold medal for an Olympic swimming competition for women was won by AustralianFanny Durack.

In Stockholm, the 5000m men's final was held on July 10.

This photograph shows the dramatic end of the race, when Finnish athlete Hannes Kolehmainen overtook French athlete Jean Bouin at the last moment.

Kolehmainen set a world record with his victory. He went on to win 3 more Olympic gold medals: in the 10000 metre and cross country races in 1912 and in the marathon inAntwerp in 1920.

The 1920 summer Olympic Games were held in Antwerp, Belgium.

This photograph shows the beginning of the men's marathon. The race was won by Hannes Kolehmainen (in the photograph above) whose victory gave Finland its first ever Olympic marathon medal.

This photograph shows the 110 metres hurdles race during the Antwerp Olympic Games.

The gold medal was won by Canadian athlete Earl John Thomson who set a world record. Americans Harold Barron and Frederick Murray came second and third.

Diving events at the 1920 Olympic Games were held at the Stade Nautique d'Antwerp.

This photograph shows British diver Harold Clarke, who finished ninth in the plain high diving event. He also competed at the 1908 and 1924 Olympic Games.

The 1968 Olympic Games were held in Mexico City.

This photograph shows Heinz Erbstößer, an athlete from East Germany who was part of the 4x100 metre relay team. Despite leading the race, the team struggled with the final baton exchange and eventually finished in fifth.

Exploration and human endeavour

“What are men to rocks and mountains?” ― Jane Austen, Pride and Prejudice Human exploration of and travel through mountains dates back millennia. It’s only in the last few centuries, though, that exploration of mountains for exploration's sake, or for sport and tourism, has come into existence.

Before exploration - or sport - led people into the mountains, war did it and continues to do so. Mountains form barriers between countries and controlling the passes through them or finding ways around them is vital. Mountains are also particularly difficult places for warfare, the cold and risk of landslides, or falls, adding to the violence of war.

Hannibal and his cavalry passing Mons Jovis, the British Library, Public Domain

One of the great mountain campaigns - certainly the most famous - is Hannibal’s crossing of the Alps. In 218 BC, the Carthaginian general Hannibal Barca led an army of over 40 thousand, (including 37 war elephants) over the Alps and down into Italy to attack the Roman Republic. The story of Hannibal crossing the Alps became a popular tale of military genius and drama, and has been retold many times. The illustration above, from a medieval manuscript on Roman history, depicts Hannibal and his cavalry in medieval armour passing through the St. Bernard pass, or Mons Jovis.

The First World War also led to soldiers into the mountains. While the most common image of this war is of the trenches and no man’s land of northern France, the Austro-Hungarian and Italian armies also fought high up in the Alps and Dolomites, including around Marmolada. Instead of digging trenches, the Austro-Hungarian forces burrowed tunnels into the ice and rock of the mountains. More soldiers died due to the cold and avalanches than from gunfire.

Outside of war, the early mountain climbers organised expeditions for geographical and scientific research, or simply for fame. Their expeditions started in the mountains of Europe and spread to include the highest mountain range in the world, the Himalayas.

From‘The ascent of the Matterhorn’, by Edward Whymper, Swiss National Library, Public Domain

Expeditions into the Alps had their golden age in the mid-1800s, when a combination of British ‘alpinists’ and their French or Swiss guides made the first recorded climbs of the French and Swiss Alps. The British Alpine Club was a gathering of these alpinists, including Edward Whymper. He led the first expedition to reach the top of the Matterhorn, one of the deadliest mountains in the world. Tragically, on the descent, the four other British alpinists on the climb: Lord Francis Douglas, Charles Hudson, Douglas Hadow and Michel Croz, all died.

Base Camp Rongbuk, 1924 Everest Expedition, Trinity College Dublin, CC0

After the Alps came exploration of the Himalayas. The most important of these was the scaling of Mount Everest, the tallest mountain in the world. In 1924, the Second British Everest Expedition made three attempts to reach the top, which ended in tragedy when two climbers, George Mallory and Andrew Irvine, died on the mountain. The expedition team included a naturalist and doctor, Richard Hingston, to study the wildlife and flora of the Himalayas as well as treating injuries and illnesses. He also brought back a range of black and white slides of the expedition.

As the first phase of alpinism was finishing, mountains quickly became a site for tourism, as well as difficult explorations. Rather than requiring people to risk their lives climbing the dangerous slopes of the Alps and Himalayas, safe routes, as well as ways to use and enjoy the mountains from the safety of your own home, came into being.

Grand St. Bernard Pass Hospice, National Library of Bulgaria, Public Domain

Hospices and hostels in the Alps date back to the medieval period, where they were safe points for travellers through the mountains to take refuge from the weather, but also from bandits and brigands. The most famous of these hospices is at Grand St. Bernard Pass, founded in 1050 AD (this is not to be confused with the Little St. Bernard Pass, where Hannibal is thought to have arrived in Italy, which is 30 kilometres away). As the mountains became tourism sites in the 1800s, these hospices became something more like a hotel, from which hikers would set out to enjoy the mountains.

From‘In the Alsatian mountains : a narrative of a tour in the Vosges’by Katherine Lee, National Library of France

Travel narratives were also a major part of mountaineering history, such as this book describing an early 1800s trip by an English couple to the Alsatian mountains. Like today’s travel writing, much is made of the cultural difference between the travellers and the locals, the difficulties and entertainments of travel and the often odd behaviour of the other travellers of one’s own nationality.

Even those who did not travel could partake of the mountains through these books, and through the paintings and panoramas of mountains that were available. By now, all the great mountains, including the ‘third pole’ of Everest, have been scaled, and aircraft and tunnels have made mountains less of a challenge to navigate over, around or through. But the Alpine Club still exists, and the thrill of mountains and mountaineering still hold a place in many people’s hearts and imaginations.

In Europeana, you will find over 53 million artworks, artefacts, books, videos and sounds from across Europe. But our collections cover more continents than just Europe.

So with athletes, media and spectators arriving in Rio de Janeiro for the 2016 Olympic Games, we've selected some historic photographs of the city, from when it was still the capital of Brazil (a title it held until 1960).

Europeans have been visiting Rio de Janeiro for centuries. The photographs selected here date from the 20th century, when Rio became known as a tourist attraction and they feature some of the city's best known sights.

This photograph (from the collection of theNorwegian Museum of Science and Technology) is one of the earliest in the collection, estimated to date from between 1890 and 1910. It shows the Gloria neighbourhood in Rio's historic centre, with Sugarloaf Mountain in the background.

Rio's reputation as a tourist attraction grew through the early years of the 20th century, particularly as the city expanded to the south.

The Copacabana beach-front neighbourhood developed following the construction of a tunnel connecting it to the city's historic centre. In 1923, the Copacabana Palace Hotel opened, and became famed as South America's premier hotel.

The two photographs below from the collection of theCircus Museumwere taken during a Sarrasani Circus tour to South America in the 1930s. They show Copacabana Beach, with its promenade geometric wave mosaic.

Finally, from theHistoric Postcard collection of the University of Osnaburk, this postcard dated 1938 shows a palm-tree lined street with the famous Christ the Redeemer statue atop Corcovado mountain in the background.

An introduction to Scottish work songs

Work songs were commonplace in Scotland for hundreds of years and, whatever the activity, there would be a song to accompany it and match the speed at which it was being undertaken.

These songs also served a social purpose, as they enabled people to relate specific thoughts about their communities and the subjects which were important to them. Songs sung together also generated a bond between the participants, giving a sense of attachment and of sharing experiences while toiling together.Crofters taking a break from sheep-shearing. Picture by Mairi Lindsay.CC BY-SAThere are two main categories of work songs- those which were sung while work was being done and those about work which were sung in people's leisure time. Songs in the first category include those which were sung while waulking, milking cows, rowing, spinning wool, and churning butter. Waulking was the last stage in the production of homespun tweed and was a process in which the cloth would be beaten rhythmically, usually by hand, to shrink and soften it. It would generally be carried out by a group of between eight and twelve women on a hard surface, such as a table. Waulking songs would be sung throughout this laborious process in order to keep the rhythm and make the work a little easier. It was also a social occasion, with the opportunity to catch up on local news and gossip. Typically, one woman would sing the verses of the song and the others would join in on the chorus. You can hear an example of this is in the waulking song ‘Gur Mis’ Tha Fo Èislean’, which is sung here by Penny MacLellan of South Uist in the Western Isles from a recording made in 1949. In the first part of the song, a woman watches a female deer and her mate playing together and, unlike the woman, they are happy. In the second section, the composer wishes she could spend a week in the form of a goose, mallard or seagull.

Cattle played a significant role in the economic livelihood of the Highlands and one of the tasks relating to them was milking cows by hand. Milking songs were sung to pacify them and encourage them to give as large a yield as possible. Click below to hear the milking song 'Till an Crodh, Fair an Crodh', sung by Iseabail T MacDonald of South Uist. This composer asks the subject of the song to bring back the stolen cattle and says he will get a beautiful wife in return.

Many Scottish communities in coastal areas and islands were dependent on the sea for their livelihoods and for travel to and from the mainland. Men rowing boats would sing choral songs which would match the stroke of the oars and help those rowing to forget their hardships, even in squally weather. Listen to James MacDonald from the Isle of Skye sing the rowing song ‘Iomaraibh Eutrom Hò Hò’ in 1955. The chorus of the song asks the crew to pull the oars lightly.

The second category of work songs includes bothy ballads, songs about whaling, fishing, mining, and railway and mill work. Bothy ballads originated in the farming areas of the north east of Scotland, at a time when unmarried farm labourers lived in outbuildings known as bothies. Conditions in the bothies could be grim and the cattle and horses often had better accommodation than they did. In the evenings the labourers would sing to entertain themselves. As well as old songs, they would compose songs about their experiences on the farms. Often the songs would be critical of the farmer, although a few were praised, and these social commentaries of country life came to be known as bothy ballads. One such example is ‘The Barnyards o Delgaty’ in which the composer pokes fun at the farm on which he works and the other farm workers. It is sung here by George Inglis Fraser from Aberdeenshire.

The creation of factories, mills and railways during the Industrial Revolution meant that it was no longer possible to use music to synchronise action between workers in such noisy environments. As a result, workers used songs with which they were familiar, such as ballads and agricultural work songs, and adapted them to their new experiences and circumstances. These songs would describe their work and working conditions, and some of them were political in nature. The building of railway lines was very labour intensive and the men who worked on them were known as navvies. Most of the work was done by hand and the standard tools of the trade were shovels, picks and wheelbarrows. Incidence of death at work was high, especially for those building tunnels, with the added risk of explosions and tunnel collapses. In this song entitled ‘The Navvy’, the composer sings of his life of travel and work, and the important role which the navvies played in developing the infrastructure of cities and towns. It is sung by William Taylor from Dundee.

Judith is the embodiment of courage, self-sacrifice, and patriotism linked to female beauty

A whole book is devoted to Judith as she is the embodiment of courage, self-sacrifice, and patriotism linked to female beauty. She has always captured the imagination of artists and her story has been presented in countless variations in many works of art, music and literature. Above all, the bloody spectacle of the beheading of Holofernes became a frequently used picture theme.

Judith is a rich Jewish widow with a beautiful figure and a thriving appearance from the Biblical town Bethulia. The city is under siege by the Assyrian army with Holofernes being the general of that army. The Jewish town is about to give up and Judith has a plan to save Bethulia.

She dresses herself up so as to catch the eye of any man who might see her and set off with her maid into the Assyrian lines. Judith is able to cross the enemy's lines, as she is seen as betraying her own town.

She uses her charms to enter the tent of Holofernes. Once in his tent Judith seduced the general and gave him a lot of wine to drink. By now we are in the situation depicted in the paintings below. As Holofernes fell asleep drunk, Judith beheaded him with his own sword.

In the next moment, after the beheading her maid was ready with a sack into which they put the head to bring it back to Bethulia.

Judith returns to her people victorious, holding up the head as a trophy to show everyone in the town that they are now safe. The news threw the Assyrians into disarray, the Bethulians regain their courage, raid the Assyrian camp and drive the enemy away.

During the field-research carried out in the prefecture of Evros in 1996 for the 'Thrace' programme of theMusic Library of Greece, only one zournas-player was located and recorded.

His name was Arif Karatza and he was born in Kyani in 1923 and lived in Didymoteichon in northern Greece.

Arif Karatza from Didymoteichon playing zournas, Music Library of Greece of the Friends of Music Society,CC BY-NC.

Here you can listen to his music playing and read some excerpts of his interviews on his art.

I learned by myself. I’d played thekaval(a small woodenfloyera) since I was a small boy. I also played thegaidawhen I was little, while I was minding the goats. After thegaidaI decided to have a change and started to play thesournas.I began to play all on my own […] If you started when you’re young, you can learn a skill. A older person is like a solid piece of wood: can you bend it? You certainly can’t! But if the wood is still quite supple, you can do something with it […] I didn’t learn from a master player. We had one [who played the zournas], [but] he refused to take me along with him, so that I wouldn’t learn. His name was Ameti. I used to say to him: “One day you’ll ne dead, you could at least teach us something, but you’re a fiend, you’re no master! You can’t take your hands with you, you know! Show us how to play a song, where it’s come from and how it goes”. If I take [a piece] and set out on the road with it, will I manage to find an end to this road?

Every town and village has its own way, its own system, [just as] every song has its own sound. […] Here we’ve got different patterns; [I play] from here, from Orestiada northwards. Around Rizia, Kastanies, from there on up […] and from Chilia on. I don’t play far away.

You mustn’t think of thezournasand theklarinoas being the same. Theklarinosounds quite different, it’s got a different attraction. Thezournashas only holes, no buttons [keys, like the _klarino_]. The buttons are hard work! But in those days, when I was young, you couldn’t find aklarino. Now things are different. What would I do with aklarinonow? It’s too late.Gaidesanddaoulia– they’re old hat now! Nowadays people haven’t got the same longing to learn, they learn to play theklarino.The really good old _daouli-_players are all dead, like the _zournas-_players. Now people play theklarino,and all that’s gone. I’m the [only] one, there are no other zournas-players […]. Nobody wants thezournasany more – its days are over!

How I found out about my relative who fought in World War I

Everyone googles their name from time to time. But have you tried doing the same inEuropeana?

Cultural heritage is often our shared heritage - the books, archives, paintings, sculptures, music and more that we as Europeans and people share. Sometimes though cultural heritage can mean your own heritage, your own lost cultural and family past. Europeana and its providers offer a chance to discover more of our cultural heritage, and that includes our personal cultural heritage. Simply searching for your own surname, as I did, can reveal parts of that heritage you have never heard of.

ThroughEuropeana 1914-1918, the British Library provided a range of personal archives from the First World War to Europeana. One of these is the ‘Garvin Papers’, a collection of photographs, letters, news cuttings, and personal papers related to a young army officer named Roland Gerald ‘Ger’ Garvin. It includes letters from when he was posted in France, photographs of him and his family, papers related to his job as an officer in the British Army, and newspaper cuttings announcing his death during the Battle of the Somme, 1916.

These Garvins aren’t direct ancestors of mine, but they are still very likely to be family (Garvin isn’t that common a surname). This isn’t the experience of finding a long lost ancestor, but more like a long lost cousin, one who took a very different path. It is interesting to see the details of Roland Garvin’s life - born in Newcastle, educated at a public school where he studied German and competed in national fencing competitions, joined the army at the start of the war.

He also died very young, only 20 years old. A large section of the Garvin Papers is dedicated to letters to his family about his death, along with obituaries, including one written by his father. Alongside those are documents and papers from his time in the war, showing the rules and context of his life in his last two years of life.

The Papers also give an insight into his life and family before he died. His family take the central role in the photographs, many of which are only of his sisters. As well as an insight into the Garvin’s family life, it’s an insight into the life of an upper class Irish family in Britain. Roland’s sister, Katherine, is pictured in costume as an ‘Irish Colleen in Fairyland’, but it’s clear that Roland himself fitted easily into English upper class life, attending Westminster, enrolling in Oxford, and joining the South Lancashire Regiment.

It’s easy to think that Europeana and other cultural institutes only have material about the famous people like Charles Darwin or Joan of Arc. That’s not true though - these institutes are a collective memory, preserving collections from a wide range of sources. Through Europeana Collections 1914-1918 I found a relative who had fought in the First World War and died at only 20 - what might you find?

Who was Gottfried Moses Ruben?

The Talking Machine

Phonograph recording sessions

Digitising the Ruben Collection

Treasure Quest

How Gottfried Moses Ruben brought the phonograph to Denmark

The Ruben Collection is a collection of wax cylinders on the shelves at the State and University Library (Statsbiblioteket) in Aarhus, Denmark. These are a collection of early Danish phonograph recordings from the late 19th century.

As a young man Gottfried Moses Ruben started working in his father's menswear fashion shop but that wasn't young Ruben's dream job. No - he wanted to see the world. He went first to Portugal. Then three years later he was appointed Consul General ofPortugalin Copenhagen.

At the World Exhibition inParisin 1889, Ruben met Thomas Edison, who just had invented the 'talking machine', or the phonograph. Ruben was impressed by the phonograph, a revolutionary invention for the preservation of sound.

Thanks to Ruben, the phonograph made its way to Denmark in 1889. Ruben imported phonographs and sold them for 700 kroner a piece. And its arrival is the reason why we can enjoy the audio from late 19th century Copenhagen today.

However, he didn’t make much money, as only very few people could afford to buy one (a maid, for example, only earned about 100-120 kroner a year at that time).



Thomas Edison with his second phonograph, photographed by Mathew Brady in Washington, April 1878,  Library of Congress, CCO

Ruben tried other initiatives to make the phonograph popular - he invited famous men and women to come to his studio and talk, sing or play an instrument in front of the phonograph's cone.

He also invited the general public to attend his recording sessions and to see the phonograph. You even could borrow a phonograph and a technician to divert guests at private dinner parties - like a jukebox of the late 19th century, so to speak. Last but not least he also invited the Danish newspapers to his demonstrations of the phonograph.

Ruben is believed to have recorded about 500 wax cylinders between 1889 and 1897. Most of the cylinders got lost, probably because of physical decay due to poor storage conditions.

In 1993 what was left of the Ruben collection came to Statsbiblioteket. The digitisation of the Ruben cylinders was a matter of urgency. However that wasn’t just something to experiment with as wax cylinders are very very fragile. Austrian expert Franz Lechleitner (Phonogrammarchiv) helped the digitisation team at Statsbiblioteket.

And the result: 160 raw digital audio files.

An untutored ear only might only hear cracking and sizzling noises when listening to many of the Ruben recordings. Audio engineer Claus Byrith did an excellent sound restoration job.

As Ruben had not kept any register of his recordings, Steen Kaargaard Nielsen, associate professor in musicology at Aarhus University worked with great enthusiasm on identifying the content of the wax cylinders and he found some great stuff.



Leporello's costume, 1829, engraved by Louis Maleuvre, Bibliothèque nationale de France, CCO

In particular one of the cylinders contained the oldest existing Mozart recording of opera singer Peter Schram singing two fragments of Leporello's arias fromDon Giovanni. A find rare enough to make anyone wax lyrical!

Today, the world knows Gustav Mahler primarily as a composer. During his lifetime at the beginning of the 20th century, this was all quite different.

Mahler in the first place was known as an internationally respected conductor, while his own work as a composer was not much recognised for a long time. There are not many known recordings of Mahler’s own works from the first half of the 20th century.

It was not until the 1960s that his compositional work was recorded extensively.

Leonard Bernstein was one of the first to rediscover Mahler’s compositions. Although he almost faded into oblivion for a long time, Mahler as a 'late-romantic' had a strong influence on the main composers of the so-called 'Second Viennese School', a group of composers that gathered around Arnold Schönberg, who admired Mahler’s work and marked a transition to a new era in music history.

"Mahler was a saint!" Arnold Schönberg about Mahler in 1912)

Schönberg met Mahler after 1903 in Vienna where he taught composition. Mahler became friends with Schönberg, he had great respect for the younger composer and his ideas and promoted Schönberg's music.

After attending the premiere of Schönberg's Chamber Symphony No. 1 in 1907, he allegedly said to his wife Alma:'I don’t understand his music, but he is young; maybe he is right'('Ich verstehe seine Musik nicht, aber er ist jung; vielleicht hat er recht').

Alban Berg studied with Arnold Schönberg since 1904. After six years, he started his career as a composer, combining influences of Mahler‘s late-romantic work and Schönberg‘s free tonality.

In 1913 the premiere of two of hisFive Orchestral Songs on Picture-Postcard Texts by Peter Altenberg, op. 4 conducted by Arnold Schönberg were part of the so-called 'Skandalkonzert'. The audience at the Musikverein was shocked by the music, while Berg’s composition was played, people started fighting within the concert hall and the concert had to be canceled.

This evening was one of the biggest musical scandals at the beginning of the 20th century in Vienna. Berg's operasWozzeckandLulu, which were the first operas completely written in twelve-tone technique however marked a turning point in opera history and brought Alban Berg wide public success.

Also on the programme of the 'Skandalkonzert' were theSix Pieces for Orchestra, Op. 6composed by Anton von Webern, also a member of the Second Viennese School’s inner circle. Along with Alban Berg he studied composition with Arnold Schönberg and was also a great admirer of Mahler‘s work. His compositions were considered the most extreme of the Second Viennese School.

Four orchestral Songs on poems by Maeterlinck, a composition of Alexander von Zemlinsky, were also presented at the 'Skandalkonzert'.

Alexander von Zemlinsky gave Schönberg lessons in counterpoint, became his close friend (and after marrying his sister also his brother-in-law) and – to close the circle to Gustav Mahler again – had fallen in love with and taught composition to Alma Schindler, who then married Gustav Mahler in 1902.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the music scene of Vienna was a creative melting pot of different cultures and visionary ideas and – though igniting vigorous debates and rejection at the time – later gained worldwide recognition and was formative for the whole century and onwards.

Meet Queen Summer

Did you love fairy tales growing up? Perhaps, as an adult, you still enjoy their magic, often brought to life through beautiful illustrations. There are plenty of fairy tales in Europeana but one,Queen Summer: The Tourney of the Lily and the Rosestands out.

An epic poem about the allegorical figure Queen Summer, the book was written and illustrated by the English painter Walter Crane (1845-1915). Crane is considered to be one of the most influential illustrators in the development of children's picture books. His books are now extremely rare and have become expensive collectors items.

The whole tale can be viewed viaEuropeana, but below, we’ve chosen some of the loveliest pages. Enjoy!

It's summertime and Queen Summer rules all the flowers in the land -



- she holds her court in a flower garden, where Rose and Lily compete. Both want to wear the summer crown - so they decide to fight for the honour -



- the flowers are armoured with lances and shields as they mount their horses for the tournament -



- but the crowd of flowers cried for roses or for lilie’s life -



- until at last up rose the queen, and to each warrior she said “nor rose nor lily shall plant on high, but be side by side in equal right” -

A highlight of Gustav Mahler’s career as a conductor

The Vienna Court Opera was the carefully planned highlight of Gustav Mahler’s career as a conductor. On 11 May, 1897 he debuted initially as a chapelmaster with Richard Wagner’sLohengrin(with Hermann Winkelmann as Lohengrin and Louise Ehrenstein as Elsa).

Half a year later, on 8 October, he became the director of the Vienna Court Opera and held this position until 1907.

The years at the Vienna Court Opera are the most productive of Mahler’s artistic career.

As director and conductor, he reformed the performance system. In the summer months, the symphonies 4-8, his major compositional work was born. Gustav Mahler conducted over 300 performances in the first four seasons, including 25 premieres or first performances. The focus of his repertoire as a conductor was Richard Wagner’s oeuvre:Der Ring des Nibelungenin 1898 was one of the first artistic highlights.

New singers were engaged, like the sopranos Selma Kurz and Anna Mildenburg and the heroic tenor Erik Schmedes, who followed Mahler in his artistic ideas and soon became the audience’s favorites.

At the turn of the century, a rejuvenation of the ensemble began.

Among the new singers were the soprano Marie Gutheil-Schoder and the important tenor Leo Slezak. Among the new productions of these years, Wagner's Tristan und Isolde (Tristan: Erik Schmedes, Isolde: Anna von Mildenburg) was particularly significant. It was the first collaboration with the painter and co-founder of the Vienna Secession, Alfred Roller.

With Roller at his side, Mahler set standards for new stage aesthetics. After Tristan und Isolde in 1903, Fidelio (1904), Das Rheingold (1905), Don Giovanni (1905) and Iphigenia in Aulis (1907) followed.

The last years of the Mahler era were marked by exemplary performances in collaboration with Alfred Roller as well as increasing attacks and conflicts.

Although Mahler conducted around 150 performances in his last four seasons, his temporary absence as a conductor of his own work was criticised. Conflicts with singers or with the bureaucracy and an anti-Semitic press against Mahler weakened his position.

Mahler resigned in 1907. On 15 October 1907, he conducted his final performance at the Vienna Court Opera: Beethoven's Fidelio (with Anna Mildenburg as Leonore and Georg Maikl as Florestan). In December 1907, he left to take up his engagement at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. Mahler’s departure finally indicated a turning point for the musical life of Vienna.

Sound recordings with singers from the outstanding ensemble of the Vienna Court Opera exist: shellac recordings from 1902 to 1912 with Leo Slezak, Anna von Mildenburg, Selma Kurz and many others. Listen to examples of these recordings on Soundcloud.

Is anybody out there?

Planet from "L'Espace céleste et la nature tropicale...", The British Library, public domain

Today, mankind is reaching further out into space than ever before through our unmanned probes and rovers. This is not a new ambition though - we have always looked outwards and wanted to understand what is there, above our heads, in space. Going back through the collections of libraries in Europeana, the history of our interest in space and our neighbours in the solar system is clear to see.Harmony of the spheres..., National Library of The Netherlands, public domain

The history of astronomy is both ancient and everywhere - cultures all over the worlds have tried to understand and measure the motions of the stars, the planets, and the sun. Some of the oldest written astronomy (the sort of thing that turns up in libraries) is the Ptolemaic astronomy. Ptolemy and his followers believed that the Earth was the centre of a relatively small universe, orbited by the Moon, Sun, and the five (known) planets.

The National Library of Malta recently digitized many late medieval texts, including an influential Ptolemaic text called‘Sphaera Mundi’by Johannes de Sacro Bosco. This book is the source for much of the famous ideas of the Ptolemaic astronomers - that the universe is a perfect sphere, that it is solid and that it is split between the changing world below the Moon and the changeless one above.

Sidereus, nuncius magna longeqve admirabilia spectacula..., The Wellcome Library, CC BY

The Ptolemaic system continued as the basic astronomical belief of Europe until Copernicus’s‘On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres’. Copernicus, and his followers such as Galileo and Kepler, argued that in fact the Sun was the centre of the universe, with the six planets (including Earth) orbiting them, some of them with their own orbiting bodies (the Moon itself, and the ‘Medecian planets’ that Galileo saw around Jupiter or the rings he saw around Saturn). They also argued that the space above the Moon was also subject to change, and that the stars were much further away than anyone had ever considered possible. Galileo in particular opened up the idea that the planets had their own geographies, identifying mountains on the Moon.

Mars, by Percival Lowell,..., National Library Of France, public domain

Today we know more than ever about the mountains, volcanos, canyons, and plains of the solid planets of our solar system, with space probes going as far as Pluto to send back images.  In the late 1800s, two astronomers in different continents gave us a deeper, but flawed, look at other worlds, specifically Mars. Giovanni Schiaparelli was among the first to name the ‘seas’ and ‘continents’ of Mars, and also reported what he called ‘canali’ by which he meant natural channels, but some interpreted as artificial canals. Inspired by this, Percival Lowell used a large telescope to capture images of Mars, which he published in his book‘Mars’.

Both Lowell and Schiaparelli believed that there was life on Mars  (Schiaparelli wrote a book called ‘Life on Mars’),  though Lowell went further and argued that what he had found proved that there were vast canals and reservoirs on Mars, built by a Martian civilisation to survive on their dry and cold planet. While this turned out to be the product of optical illusions and the fuzziness of the telescopes of the day, Lowell and Schiaparelli’s work popularised planetary science, and Lowell was the first astronomer to set up an observatory in a place far from light pollution.

Science fiction from 'Fifteen Hundred Miles an Hour...,The British Library, public domain

Of course, our interest in other planets hasn’t been limited to the sciences. Fiction has told stories of trips to and from other planets for a long time. In the same year that Lowell published ‘Mars’, a writer by the name of Charles Dixon published a book called‘Fifteen hundred miles an hour’, claiming to be the record of an actual trip to Mars that the author found in a meteorite - the Victorian version of a found footage movie. This science fiction (or science fantasy or science romance) presented a Mars covered in strange foliage and inhabited by humanoid aliens. While this was very far from the sort of thing Lowell was arguing for, it also shows how fascinating we have always found the other worlds near us.

From Padua to Vienna

A creative partnership: Draghi and Niccolo Minato

A grand performance

Around 170 dramatic secular and 40 dramatic sacred works: this is the number of works that Italian composer Antonio Draghi created over the course of 30 years. He is said to have written around 6 operas per year on average – with a creative peak of 11 operas in 1685 alone.

In thetwo collectionsof the music department of theAustrian National Library, content from which was made available onEuropeana Collectionsas part of the Europeana Sounds Project (theTresorsammlung(Safe Collection) and thebibliotheca cubicularis(Bedroom Library) of Emperor Leopold I), Antonio Draghi is the most featured composer of thebibliotheca cubicularis.

Antonio Draghi was born around 1634 in Rimini, Italy, and died 1700 in Vienna. His exact birth date is not known, but can be reconstructed from his death certificate, which states that he died at the age of 65. Information about Draghi’s youth is scarce.

The earliest valid information we possess directs us to the basilica of St. Antonio in Padua, where he started out as a soprano in 1645. He stayed there almost continually until 1651, when he left as a bass singer.

Afterwards he worked at the Accademia della Morte in Ferrara. His career in Vienna started in 1658, when he joined the newly founded Kapelle (chapel) of the dowager empress Eleonora Gonzaga, the widow of Ferdinand III, as a bass singer. The Kapellmeister (director of music of a chapel) during this time was Giuseppe Tricarico, who also came from Ferrara to Vienna.

Draghi had to wait some 3 years, until 1661, before his creative output in Vienna started - the same year he married Livia Seliprandi. In the first compositions he worked on, however, he did not act as a composer, but as a librettist. This might be due to the fact, that, during that time, good musicians were always at hand at the Viennese court but poets were rather scarce.

One of the first texts he wrote was“L’Almonte”,in 1661, with music by Giuseppe Tricarico. In the preface for this and other operas, Draghi stresses that he is first and foremost a musician and not a poet. He wrote libretti for several other composers like Antonio Bertali, the Hofkapellmeister (thedirector of music of the court chapel) during this time, or Pietro Andrea Ziani, who was the successor of Tricarico at Eleonora’s Kapelle.

The Emperor Leopold I was also an accomplished composer (see also the blog post aboutLeopold Iand his relation to music, published on Europeana Sounds' blog) with Draghi occasionally writing texts for him too.

The first work where it can be said, with certainty, that the music was written by Antonio Draghi himself was“La mascharata per musica”in 1666. It was an opera for Carnival and was the first comical opera that was ever shown in Vienna.

In 1667 his workload started to increase due to the marriage of Emperor Leopold I, for which great festivities were being arranged. In the following year Antonio Draghi was made Vice-Kapellmeister of Eleonora’s Kapelle and finally replaced Pietro Andrea Ziani in 1669.

This was also the year in which Draghi wrote“Il Perseo”, with a libretto by Aurelio Amalteo, which he is said to have finished in just a couple of days. Amalteo apparently greatly admired the speed with which Draghi composed, and that he was able to finish a work in the time that most other composers might just manage a few sketches.

Draghi stopped writing libretti in 1669, when Niccolo Minato was appointed court poet. As their creative abilities were well-matched, a hugely productive collaboration began, lasting several decades. From around 1670 until 1698, they dominated the production of dramatic music at the Viennese court.

Together they produced around 150 works (operas, sacred works and smaller dramatic works).

Although Draghi was Kapellmeister of Leonora’s Kapelle, he also composed a lot of dramatic works for the Emperor. Thanks to his great commitment to this work, and because his duties in this area were continually increasing, he was named“intendente delle musiche teatrali”(director of dramatic music) in 1673 and received a higher salary.

He usually wrote operas and other works for birthdays and name days of the Emperor, the empress or the dowager, as well as pieces for carnival. Usually, the plots of the operas were about Greek or Roman history or mythology. He also wrote sacred dramatic music:Oratoriosfor Lent,Sepolcrifor Maundy Thursday orRapprensentazioni sacrefor Good Friday.

A third collaborator often joined Draghi and Minato in their creative endeavours - Ludovico Ottavio Burnacini - and the three men formed a well-known trio during that time. Burnacini was an architect and scene-painter and created opera houses and sceneries for operas (for example forPomo D’oro).

One of the grandest pieces the three of them worked on together was probably“Il fuoco eterno custodito dalle Vestali”. The work was originally composed for the celebration of the birth of Leopold’s first child with Claudia Felicitas, Maria Anna Sophie, and was performed on the day of her first public appearance in October in 1674. In a wider sense, the piece was allegorically connected with the marriage of Leopold with Claudia Felicitas one year earlier.

The performance was held in the“Theatre on the Cortina”, a very grand theatre constructed by Burnacini, which was inaugurated with a performance of“Il pomo D’oro”in 1668. Ludovico Burnacini created 12 sceneries for“Il fuoco eterno custodito dalle Vestali”. Below you can see the curtain he created for the piece.

The opera was newly adapted for the birth of Joseph I as“La Monarcha Latina trionfante”in 1678. In the beginning of 1682, Antonio Draghi was appointed Hofkapellmeister, leaving the Kapelle of the dowager empress and continuing his duties at the Kapelle of the Emperor.

Due to his hard work and his numerous compositions, Draghi earned a good living and owned several houses. Around 1687 he began to suffer from gout, but coped with it for 10 years before it had a serious impact on his work as a composer. Even then, he maintained the post of Kapellmeister until his death in 1700.

One of the great 20th century Latvian opera voices

Historical sound recordings are treasures that, since the end of 19th century, inform us about musical life, about performers and about musical interpretation. We would like to tell you about one of the great 20th century Latvian opera voices, a coloratura soprano, whose recording legacy is a powerful witness to her remarkable voice. On hearing her recordings today, even with so many brilliant and talented singers all around us, one can agree with the sensation and excitement created by the press in the 1930s about the“Latvian Nightingale”.

Elfrīda Pakule, unknown author, 1948 Elfrīda Pakule’s (1912-1991) path to the opera stage was forged with slow and patient work, but fame and success came fast and was spectacular. In 1930 in Rīga, Latvia, the owner of an excellent tenor voice Pauls Sakss (1899-1966) agreed to become Elfrīda’s vocal teacher, with the provision that she fully submitted to his teaching regime.

The rules were as follows:

After eight years of private teaching, P. Sakss finally permitted Elfrīda to make her debut in a radio broadcast, accompanied by symphonic orchestra. And so on May 3, 1938 her first public performance took place. The public and critical reaction was undivided – it was a sensation! High praise was given to her vocal technique as well as her musical talent.

An excerpt from an article in the local press reads:Rigasche Rundschau, 29.11.1938, “_eine Koloratursängerin von ausgezeichneten Qualitäten… Ihre Fiorituren un Läufer, Kadenzen, Staccati, Portati geben sich leicht und flüssig und entbehren nie des Charmes, weil die Stimme der Sängerin selbst in den höchsten Lagen noch Weicheit und Wohllaut zeigt. Dazu kommt der seine musikalische Geschmak_…”(“a coloratura singer with excellent qualities…her fioriture and vocal runs, cadences, staccato, and portato are easy and fluent and never devoid of charm, because the singer’s voice even at the highest ranges still shows softness and sonorousness.

Her next concert soon followed. The concert hall was overcrowded with more than 1000 listeners, quite an unusual phenomenon in Latvia’s musical life at that time. The praise following the event was neverending. We can guess what happened next – Elfrīda was invited to become a soloist in the Riga Opera House, where operas of W.A.Mozart, G.Verdi, G.Puccini were regularly performed. In 1941 E. Pakule was one of three candidates selected to participate in a performers’ competition in Moscow. Unfortunately, all who went to the competition had to stay in Russia as just then the second World War broke out. Elfrīda continued to perform there - in hospitals, on the front and later was a very loved and respected artist at the Moscow Philharmonic. Only after the war was she able to return to Riga, where she was asked to return immediately to the opera stage. And now let’s listen to this unique voice:

Battle of Livorno, 14 March 1653, an incident from the First Anglo-Dutch War, anonymous.Rijksmuseum, public domain.

At first, the painting above looks like many you've seen before. A grand, naval scene with clouds billowing above inflated sails. But hang on. What's that in the bottom corner? A crumpled note of some kind. A little flourish from the artist telling you which ship is which. It's just one example of atrompe l’oeil,meaning to 'deceive the eye' when translated from the French. It's an artistic trick turning two dimensions into three. Art history is full of them - from banquet tables groaning with delicacies good enough to reach out and eat, to wallpaper that beckons you down a phantom corridor. Fittingly for an optical trick, thetrompe l’oeilcan take all shapes and sizes.

Like many great inventions, thetrompe l’oeilstarted out with a competition. Two painters,Zeuxis and Parrhasius, came head to head in ancient Greece, both eager to prove they were the superior artist. Their challenge? To paint the most deceptively life-like work of art. Zeuxis was up first, and painted some grapes so juicily real birds flew down to steal them. Parrhasius went next. He invited Zeuxis to unveil his rival work. When Zeuxis went to draw the curtain aside, he realised he had been beaten. The curtain was merely an illusion.

A wayward god in animal form

Meet Pan - god of the forest and fields and patron of shepherds. If you're startled by his ugly fur-coated appearance, with horns sprouting from his head and goat-like legs, you're not alone - these always send those who dare disturb him into a panic. Despite his off-putting appearance, Pan is also known as the eternally lustful god, a companion of playful nymphs who takes pleasure in music, dance and merriment.



Reclining Pan with a bunch of grapes, Signorum Veterum Icones IIby Jan de Bisschop, c. 1664. Rijksmuseum, Public Domain

According to a myth, one day Pan came across an enchanting nymph called Syrinx, widely known for her beauty. Pan immediately fell in love with her, and competed for her with the vehemence of a god. Hairy all over his body like an animal, with his horns and goat legs, he terrified the delicate nymph. As a result, Pan pursued her with even more fervour.



Pan and Syrinxby Caesar Boëtius van Everdingen, c. 1637 - c. 1640.  Rijksmuseum, Public Domain

Syrinx escaped to get away from Pan until blocked by a river. The nymph could not swim and there was no way to cross the water. Pan was about to overpower her - all that was left for her to was to ask for help. All of a sudden, she was transformed into a reed.



Pan and Syrinx, Ovidius' Metamorfosenby Hendrick Goltzius, 1589. Rijksmuseum, Public Domain

By the time Pan reaches her, all he can grab hold of are the reeds standing in her place. When the wind blows, plaintive sounds emerge - knowing he wanted to keep this sound, Pan breaks the reeds and makes a panpipe. With this, he hears the tender sounds of Syrinx forever more.

In the French cult film "Amélie" the young heroine imagines how a record is created: like making a crepe, you pour a liquid substance onto a hot, circular surface and smooth out the "batter" of the record with a wooden stick. Finally you apply the paper label firmly in the middle. And the record is ready.



In reality, however, records are pressed and not poured. In the cutting studio the soundtrack is cut into the master foil (the so-called "mastering" process). The master foil, or acetate, is then silvered and electrochemically coated with a thin layer of metal (galvanised). In the last major step, the foil and metal layer are separated and the latter is used as a negative mould.

Roughly 1,000 records can be pressed from it. Since the foil is no longer suitable for use after being deployed to make the first mould, the mould itself is then used to create further moulds. The negative moulds are also known as matrices. Before the pressing process, the matrices must be centred and the edges trimmed before being clamped in the press. The so-called vinyl cake is then mounted for the production of a vinyl record. The cake is produced shortly before the pressing process.

Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) granulate is heated to 160 degrees Celsius at which point it enters a viscous state and can be shaped into small vinyl cakes and placed in the press. The cakes weigh around 160 grams. The mould is heated to 180 degrees Celsius when the firm vinyl liquefies. A pressure of 110 tonnes is applied to press the cake into a vinyl gramophone record. It is then cooled with water. This production step takes about half a minute. These and other facts and figures are taken from the following video. The temperatures and pressures may vary depending on the pressing system.

The paper labels are applied to both sides of the blank during the pressing process. They are so firmly attached to the vinyl after the pressing that they cannot be removed without causing damage. The fact that records are usually black is due to the addition of carbon black colourant. PVC itself, however, is transparent, meaning that other colours can be added or it can be left transparent. This results in different consistencies, and the pressing process needs to be adapted accordingly.



This imagehas been created during"DensityDesign Integrated Course Final Synthesis Studio"at Polytechnic University of Milan, organised by DensityDesign Research Lab in 2015.

The final step in the production of vinyl records is trimming. Once the cake has been pressed, the protruding rim of the vinyl disc is trimmed. This operation is carried out while the vinyl is still warm; the disc is then left to cool. LP (long-playing) records with a playing time of 20 to 25 minutes per record side have a standard diameter of 12 inches and weigh 140g on average. The trimmed edge can be melted back down and used for further pressings. These days we continue the lifespan of vinyl by digitising them. Find themin Europeana.

What is Europeana 280?

What can I look out for and how can I join in?

What is the #BigArtRide?

Celebrating Europe's diverse and magnificent artworks

On 21 April, Europeana will launch Europeana 280, a cross-border campaign to get people excited about Europe’s shared art heritage by celebrating the diverse and magnificent artworks that are a part of it.

We invited all 28 EU Member States to nominate 10 pieces of art held in their country that have contributed to a major European art movement.

We’re pleased to say that every country (and Norway too) got involved. We started sharing some of these fascinating artworks in March, and will be unveiling more as the campaign begins in full.

The campaign coincides with the launch ofEuropeana Art, one of our first thematic collection sites. All the artworks nominated for Europeana 280 will be shared here.

There will be lots of ways to join in with the campaign and explore the artworks involved, both online and in person.

Since March, we've been sharing a sneak preview of what's to come on Europeana Art. We've had a changing 'Country of the Week' Spotlight, and a new cover image showcasing a highlight from this country's nominations too.



On 21 April, the first in an exciting series of public events - #BigArtRide - will take place in The Hague and Brussels.

#BigArtRide is a virtual reality event touring ten cities across Europe - The Hague,Amsterdam,Paris, Brussels, Rome,London, Berlin, Prague, Wroclaw, and Bratislava - celebrating Europe's shared art heritage and the Dutch Presidency of the EU.

It's accompanied by a colouring app,CREATE, which lets you interact with and personalise artworks featured in #BigArtRide.

On 21 April, we will also launch a unique virtual exhibition,Faces of Europe, which brings together highlights from every country's final nominations to tell the story of European culture through the eyes of its artists.

New chapters will be revealed every fortnight until July, and showcase iconic masterpieces by artists such as Goya and Gauguin alongside captivating works by less famous names.



You can also get a taste of what’s to come viaDailyArt, a fantastic free app for art lovers available on iOS & Android andArtStack, a platform that makes it easy to discover art based on your taste.

DailyArt shared a spectacular artwork from the Europeana 280 collections as their masterpiece of the day through March, and will be featuring more works soon - so stay tuned!

Throughout all of this, we will also be inviting you to get involved on social media - follow the campaign on Twitter and Facebook using#Europeana280.

What books did Ibn Battuta write?

Where did Ibn Battuta travel to?

How Ibn Battuta travelled and wrote about the world

Ibn Battuta, or ‘Abu Abd al-Lah Muhammad ibn Abd al-Lah l-Lawati t-Tangi ibn Batutah’ to give him his full name, is a strong contestant for the greatest traveller in history. Not only did he travel a distance greater than the diameter of the Earth, he did most of it overland, travelling in caravans at a time when boat was both the much faster and safer option.

He travelled from Morocco, his home, as far as Kilwa in modern Tanzania, China, and Mali, as well as visiting Mecca, Delhi, Alexandria, Jerusalem, Granada, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and Samarkand, among hundreds of other places.

He attended the courts of two different Emperors, Roman and Chinese, and visited the home city of the wealthiest man who had ever lived, Mansa Musa of Mali.

Once he returned home for good, he dictated his travels from memory to a scholar, forming a book called theRihla(Journey), orA Gift to Those Who Contemplate the Wonders of Cities and the Marvels of Travelling.

An early translation into English retitled the book asThe Travels of Ibn Battuta, while the earliest Arabic version to be published in Europe was titled in Latin asDescriptio terrae Malabar.

His travels started as a Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca that all Muslims must complete, but continued on far past that. Even so, this first trip took sixteen months and covered over 4000 kilometres, primarily overland as part of caravans.

After completing the Hajj, Ibn Battuta continued on to the Silk Road, including the Persian city of Tabriz. Tabriz had long been a major trading centre, and had continued to be so after the Mongols had conquered Persia.

Ibn Battuta’s travels also took him all around the Indian Ocean, along the east coast of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, the west coast of India, and the Maldives. In these travels he often would get involved in local politics, including being chief judge on the Maldives and marrying into the family of the monarch, Omar I.

While it's not clear how far Ibn Battuta travelled in China, he was the first Islamic writer to describe the Great Wall of China. Indeed, he was among the first Western writers to write about it, as the European travellers in China such as Marco Polo, didn't mention it.

Fortifications from "A General View of the World, geographical, historical and philosophical; on a plan entirely new", The British Library, public domain

After over two decades of travel, Ibn Battuta returned home to find that both of his parents had died in his absence. After this, he set out on a second set of travels, visiting Muslim Spain and traveling to Timbuktu and Gao, the main cities of Mali.

Though Verdun is the name of a charming provincial town, it also belongs to one of the most importantlieu de mémoirein European history - a great battle in World War One. Today, the name still resonates with an incredible force - almost equivalent to the violence of the clash it refers to. It stands for an endless range of events, battles, attacks, military movements and changing positions that took place in the area around the little fortified town, the département de la Meuse. The whole region still bears countless traces of what was one of the most terrible battles of World War One.

It all started with the fierce attacks of the German army on 21 February 1915. The war had come to a complete standstill on the Western front and the Germans were hoping to break the French defense through heavy bombing and shelling, and several massive attacks along the front line surrounding Verdun. For months, the violence went on, until almost the end of 1916.

As with many battles of such scale there is much debate about the numbers of casualties, but the sad truth is that almost 380,000 French and 350,000 German men were lost between February and December 1916: an astounding monthly average of 70,000 casualties. No wonder that Verdun still strikes a chord in the memory of so many. Les Éparges, the Argonne river, the Saint-Mihiel Salient, Fort Douaumont, la Voie Sacrée, the very names of these places have become both mythical and legendary at the same time: places where so many soldiers lost their lives and where so many heroes were born.

On the Europeana website Verdun and all its related places and events are mentioned inalmost 1000 personal stories. Sometimes only briefly, simply but sadly referring to it as the place where a grand-father lost his life, sometimes in moving letters to beloved family and friends. Some contributions contain stunning and unique photographs while other are compelling firsthand accounts of what is was to be involved in the whole hellish turmoi.

Furthermore you will findalmost 500 recordsfrom libraries and archives from all over Europe, including35 unique films.

We wish to commemorate both Verdun and those for whom the name has no mythical meaning - the men that were actually there.

An artistic genre and an allegory

The Dance of Death, also known as theDanse Macabre, represents the influence and power of death on people’s lives. It is both an artistic genre and an allegory produced to remind people of the fragility of their lives. Often, above or below the pictures, there are printed verses where Death addresses its victims.

Here, you can admire several haunting works by T. Rowlandson from the early 19th century. The satirical series is a uniquely modern interpretation of the allegory, with contemporary characters and settings bringing the tradition into the nineteenth century.

Finding artistic inspiration in cultural heritage

We love to hear about how you use Europeana. What inspires you. How the treasures you find motivate you.



Today, we hear from Kumiko Sakaki, a Japanese illustrator from Tokyo, who creates original artworks for books and magazines, using items she finds on Europeana Collections. “I’ve found inspiration in Europeana many times,” says Kumiko. “I love images and objects from the past, and I always think about history when I travel. I gather information from exploring old books and photographs, and from my European friends. But I create original artwork, so I don’t just imitate. Often, Europeana has provided inspiration - when I was researching historical uniforms, for instance, I couldn’t find out everything I wanted to know from reading books alone.”

Kumiko has two distinctive painting styles - one she thinks of as cute, warm and dreamy, and the other more nostalgic yet realistic too. It is this second style that comes through in her artworks drawing on military imagery and artefacts found on Europeana Collections. Take a look at Kumiko’s work and the items that influenced her and let us know how Europeana inspires you!

How animals have influenced Irish music

How birdsong influences traditional Irish music

Nature in Irish traditional music

Animals in 21st century Irish music

How animals and nature have influenced Irish traditional music

This blog looks at the influence of animals in music, with some fascinating collections held by theIrish Traditional Music Archive (ITMA).

In his insightful publicationA handbook of Irish music(Dublin, 1928)Richard Henebry(1863–1916) draws a comparison between innate animal sounds and aspects of melodic structure in Irish traditional music.

In particular, he refers to the descending nature of birdsong such as a warbler, a crowing cock or the lonesome howl of a dog, in what he describes as 'the pleasing pain of sadness’ shared by animal and human alike.



The geese in the bog postcard by William O'Duane, early 20th centuryCC BY-SA

As a predominantly agrarian society until the mid-20th century, awareness of nature and the environment was crucial to survival in Ireland. It is therefore not surprising that a large portion of music and song titles relate to various animals.

Titles can be a simple case of ownership, for exampleCasey’s pigorO’Donnell’s grey mare. Others create interesting imagery such as:The ewe with the crooked horn’,The geese in the bogorThe cat that kittled in Jamie’s wig(the latter having migrated to Ireland).

In all of these examples, the tune title is a completely separate entity to the melody. Another more interesting layer is added when the tune title and melody are closely connected.

In his CDThe quiet glen(Clare, 1998), the fiddlerTommy Peoplesincludes two of his own compositions,The mouse in the atticandThe fat cat. The melody of each tune reflects both the pattering feet of the mouse in the attic and the lazy ‘meeooww’ of a satisfied cat.

The influence of birds and birdsong in traditional music is also evident throughout Ireland.

The cuckoo, which appears in rural areas for a short period in late spring and early summer, produces a C sharp / A in its distinctive song. Fiddlers from past generations welcomed this ‘A’ note as a tuning aid, albeit for a limited time of the year.

The morning thrush, composed by James Ennis, father of renowned uilleann piper Séamus Ennis (1919–1982), is a particularly popular reel among pipers.

The blackbird has also proved highly influential, and there are several examples of both the air, song and set dance at ITMA.



19th century Dublin songsterCC BY-SA

Song traditions also follows a similar pattern, with humourous songs such as:Denis Kelly’s donkey,Nell Flaherty’s drakeandThe royal rats of Carn, examples of which can be found in the ITMAInishowen Song Project.

An bonnán buí(The yellow bittern) is a popular song in the Irish language tradition. It was written by poet Cathal Buí Mac Giolla Ghunna (c. 1680–1756) as a lament for a bittern that died of thirst. This apparent lament is however regarded as a tongue-in-cheek reference to the writer’s own everlasting thirst for strong liquor.

The melody ofAn bonnán buíwas collected and published by bothEdward Bunting(1773–1843) andP.W. Joyce(1827–1914):

Seán Ó Duibhir a ghleannais a song referring to the advancing plantations and dispossession of lands by Anglo-Scots in Ireland in the 17th century. This version, collected from the singing ofGerry O’Hanlon(1946-2012) from County Armagh, is abundant with colourful imagery and a powerful soundscape of nature and animal life. The opening section describes a serene summer morning disrupted by an advancing foxhunt.

How oft at sunny morning, sunshine all adorning, I have heard the dawn give warning, with birds mellow call, Badgers flee before us, woodcocks startle o’er us, Guns in ringing chorus, amid the echoes all, The fox runs high and higher, horsemen shouting nigh her, The maid in mourning, by her geese that are all gone.



Extract from a 19th centurySliabh Luachra music manuscriptCC BY-SA

Following the same theme, descriptive pieces in the tradition can reflect the clamorous sounds of a fox or hare hunt.

A good example of this isThe hunt of the hound and the hare, where the musician mimics each phase of the quest with a tune echoing the hunt’s progress until the hare is eventually pronounced dead. Similar examples include the jigHunting the hareand the songReynard the fox, both collected and published by P.W. Joyce (1827–1914).



Extract from P.W. Joyce’sAncient Irish Music(Dublin, 1873)CC BY-SA

Ireland’s economy has moved beyond agricultural dependence, and while the young 21st century singer or musician is tech savvy and increasingly urbanised, a large percentage of commercially released material continues to include animal-related titles or themes.

A recent CD donation from Australia,The freewheeler(Melbourne, 2015), features flute player Dougal Adams playingMurphy’s greyhoundandThe sheep in the boat. Likewise from the song tradition, Dublin singerLuke Cheevers'recent CDIt’s just me saggin’ shelf(Dublin, 2015) includesMiss Mousie’s Ball.

In this children's song, Miss Mousie hosts a ball inviting: Veronica Squirrel, who brushes her hair, Miss Frog, who puts on her best shoes, and Mr Hare, who receives a letter of invitation. Miss Mousie succeeds in getting Mr Fox arrested before he can gate-crash the dance!

Learn about the science of tea

A guide to consuming tea

A tea cyclopedia

Sing a ballad about tea

How the history of tea is featured in library collections across Europe

Tea is what keeps many of us going on cold, chilly winter days, when it’s raining, windy or snowing. Have you ever wanted to know more about this wonderful hot drink, about where it’s from, how you grow it, and how the plant is prepared?

Libraries are usually your best source of information, and Europeana can help you find out more from your own national library and other national libraries and research libraries in Europe.

Let's take a look to see what literature about the history of tea we can find from libraries on Europeana.

The National Library of Serbia's collection includes a technical paper from the journalGenetika. In it, you want to learn more about the science behind your cup of tea in the article 'Impacts of flushing and fermentation times on the quality of black tea' - so you can find out what separates good from bad in the world of tea.

The National Library of France has a booklet, which was published in 1845. It includes a guide to consuming and preparing tea, as well as hot chocolate. And it claims to give advice for preparing the perfect coffee.

The Bodleian Libraries, one of the foremost research libraries in Europe, offers many old books in digitized form on their website.

One of these is theTea Cyclopædiawhich offers information on tea, tea science, blights and more. It dates from 1882 - it started out as a compilation of material from theIndian Tea Gazette, and was expanded to 'add to the value of this Volume'.

The National Library of Scotland has an English ballad telling the story of John and his wife having an argument about tea.

We don't recommend fighting over tea! Especially don’t, as John does, kick over a table because there is a tea pot on it!

There’s something really interesting about this particular ballad though. Pay attention to the rhymes - the ballad is in English, but English as it was pronounced in the North East of England in the early 1800s. So 'tea' isn't the same as 'tee', but rhymes with 'day', while 'devil' rhymes with 'civil'.

The adoration of baby Jesus by the Magi, or the Adoration of the Magi as it’s known, is a popular motif in Christian art. All sorts of famous artists from Leonardo da Vinci to Sandro Botticelli and Albrecht Dürer have painted this scene. The figures depicted? Mary, Joseph and the baby Jesus being honoured by the three wise men.

Adoration of the Magiby Pieter (II) Brueghel, 1590-1638. Rijksmuseum, public domain

The motif comes from the Christmas story, the Nativity, when Jesus was born and a bright star appeared in the sky. Some Wise Men in faraway countries spotted the star, and, having studied astrology, understood its meaning: a new star appears on the birth of a great king.

The Wise Men then followed the star towards Bethlehem where it shone above the place the infant Jesus lay. When they found Jesus with his mother Mary, they bowed before him in worship. They also gave him their most beautiful and precious gifts: gold, frankincense and myrrh.

Do you believe in angels? If you don’t believe in them, you’ll certainly have heard of them. But what do they do for us humans?

Abraham with the three Angelsby Francesco Zugno, 1750-1780. Rijksmuseum, Public Domain

Angel means ‘messenger’, and this is what they do: bring messages to people telling them something they are not aware of.

It is commonly believed that angels help and protect us in moments of extreme emergency, both internally and externally. Some even believe that an angel encourages and supports us, helping us develop.

Depictions of angels in art have a long tradition.

They are a popular and often displayed motif, frequently shown as winged beings with a halo and associated  with music, perhaps holding a musical instrument in their hands, and playing beautiful unearthly music. This idea of angels has largely been influenced by the Christian art.

Everyday culture, however, shows that our great fascination with angels is now independent of the religious context.

Who were Edvard Munch's family members and how did they influence his art?

For art lovers across Europe, Edvard Munch (1863-1944) is one of modern art’s greatest painters. He is best known for his workThe Scream, which is one of the most recognisable works of art worldwide.

Munch was born on December 12, 1863, in Löten, Norway, the second of five children.

During his childhood, he experienced a series of tragedies in his family. His mother died when he  was just five years old and later, his sister Sophie died too, both succumbing to tuberculosis. Another sister was diagnosed with a serious mental illness at an early age, and Munch too was often ill.

This unfortunate stroke of fate shaped the young Munch. These experiences are no doubt part of why Munch turned, again and again, to the subject of illness, death and grief in his art.

As fans of the painter commemorate his birthday, we’ve gathered together some lesser-known photographs of Munch and his family provided by the Munchs hus, Norway.

Values from the Middle Ages

Even today, we talk about chivalry when a man is respectful, generous and above all helpful. These values go back to the Middle Ages when the history of chivalry began. We owe knights for this specific code of honour.

Bravery, loyalty, protection of the weak and the worship of women - all were major moral ideals in the Middle Ages. In day-to-day life, however, ideals and reality were often far apart. It was a rough and brutal time and even the knights did not always take their virtues seriously.

Tents and Mounted Knightsby Jean Froissart, c.1470-1472. The British Library, Public Domain

The education of a future knight usually began at an early age. First, a knight had to learn to use weapons and, most importantly, the skills of handling a horse in combat. Once his training was complete and he reached the "fighting age", he became a full-fledged knight. Not everybody was able to become a knight, though. Usually, descent from noble, chivalrous ancestors was required. For those that were deemed eligible, there was a formal ceremony in which a sword was raised by the king, queen or another nobleman in recognition of their new status.

An important part of the chivalrous life was the tournament. It served not only as entertainment, but as training for armed combat, and often resulted in injuries or even death. In the tournament, the knights proved their skill and courage to an enthusiastic audience. Despite all the dangers, especially for the younger knights, the tournament was an unmissable opportunity, and the chance for the men to obtain what they wanted most: fame and glory, a respected master and a rich woman.

Meet the skilled Japanese entertainers

A white face, pillow strapped on your back, socks and wooden flip flops - what work wear! A Geisha is a Japanese entertainer skilled in traditional Japanese art. The term Geisha is even a combination of the words for art and person.

The golden age of Geishas was in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, numbers are declining, and their services are expensive and exclusive. Though you can always dive into their world on Europeana for free!

During her education, a Geisha in training learns traditional Japanese arts like calligraphy, and to play several Japanese musical instruments like the lute, flute and hand drum. A Geisha must also be skilled in conversation, a good singer, dancer and hostess, and master the tea ceremony. To be a success, she must be graceful, charming, educated, and know the rules of etiquette, always remaining composed.

The saga of Frithiof

Do you know the legend of the Norwegian hero Frithiof? It's become an immortal Scandinavian tale - several variations of it exist, and composers and artists throughout history have been inspired by the story it tells.

In this blog, we look at some portrayals of the tale by the Swedish painter August Malmström, created in the 19th century.

The world of the Vikings is brought to life through the journey of Frithiof and his ardent love for the beautiful Ingeborg, daughter of Bele, the King of Sogn at the Sognefjord in Norway. Frithiof grew up in the companionship of Ingeborg and her brothers. After Ingeborg's father dies, Frithiof who has long loved Ingeborg, asks Ingeborg’s brothers for her hand in marriage.

The brothers, however, refuse, and marry Ingeborg off to the old king Ring. Frithiof, angered and humiliated by these new brother-kings, insults them, and is banished to live in exile.

In exile, Frithiof becomes rich, and earns glory through his reputation as a sea fighter. He sets off to meet King Ring and see the woman he has loved for so long. As a noble champion, Frithiof wins the love of the old King and he promises Frithiof his wife after his death.

After Ring’s death, Frithiof and Ingeborg are at last reunited, and Frithiof returns home to avenge his wounded pride by defeating the brother kings.

A relationship that has inspired artists for centuries

No love is stronger than the love between mother and child. Today, we want to explore the striking connection between Venus and Cupid. It’s a relationship that has been subject of many artworks throughout the centuries, inspiring painters from across Europe.

Different tales exist about the origin of Venus and Cupid. Some say that Venus, the goddess of love and beauty, had a love affair with Mars, the god of war. Out of this relationship, Cupid was born. In the following painting you see Venus with Mars, who is being disarmed by Cupid.

Mars, Venus and Cupid, Nationalmuseum Sweden, Public Domain

Cupid has attributes from both of his parents. Like his mother he is considered to be the god of love, or more precisely, the god of falling in love. He is portrayed as an innocent little child with bow and arrows. He shoots arrows to the heart, and awakening a love that you’re powerless to resist.

Venus and Cupid are often shown in intimate poses, reflecting the unique love between mother and child. In the painting below, Venus sits on her bed, while Cupid is on her lap and holding on to her neck. Both kiss each other.

Sometimes, Venus has to hold back her son, who shoots his arrows without meaning or reason into the hearts of men, igniting their desire. In this image, you can see Cupid as he begs Venus to give back his arrows.

There's all sorts of monstrous creatures in Europeana, but below, we've chosen some of our favourites. Do share your cultural heritage inspired creations with us onour Facebook! The scarier the better...

The Peruvian Harpy,Wellcome Library, CC BY

This particular outfit will suit those with long hair and big ears. Differentiate yourself from the average mermaid with your second, scaly tail.

The Games and Wine Devil,Rijksmuseum, public domain

This one's relatively straightforward to create if you happen to own a wine cellar. Note the intricate headpiece made from vines and playing cards.

Two monsters,Wellcome Library, CC BY

You can credit the vivid imagination of Italian engraver Giovanni Battista de'Cavalieri (1526–1597) for these bizarre characters. Seven heads and seven eyes, or a long snaking neck - neither of these will be easy, but you're sure to stand out from the crowd.

Interbreeding of theatre,Wellcome LibraryCC BY

This particular monster will appeal to actors and playwrights especially. The three heads represent tragedy, comedy and pantomime so you might need a couple of friends.

Praying man attacked by a demon,Lyon Municipal Library, public domain

Creep up on your unsuspecting friends dressed like this green demon and you'll be sure to give them a fright! Demons were considered particularly frightening in the Medieval era, hidden from sight but ready to spring out and lead you into temptation.

This scary creature has sharp fangs and pointy wings. Best accessorized with a head to feast on.

This rather ambitious option will please fans of French history. The monster's heads represent the Three Estates (the clergy, nobility and common people).

The Temptation,Municipal Library of Lyon, public domain

Lots of choice here. The mysterious figure on the right is probably the most sinister, and only really requires a long pointed nose and a dinner jacket.

This beast is sort of sweet, and has a coat in different shades of red, yellow and green. A long black tongue and deranged expression makes him suitable for spooking.

Another one with a variety of options to pick from... Some might make you a little unpopular!

Happy Halloween!

How alphabets shape our thoughts and words

If you’re reading this, I’m pretty sure you know your ABCs. But learning to read isn’t all there is to the alphabet. An ABC can teach you a whole lot more...

In Europeana, we have traditional alphabets showing you how to form letters inGothic styleor throughembroidery. Then other practical ones, like analphabet of sign languageand one ofsignal flags. We also have educational ABCs for children, like thealphabet of baby Jesusand thealphabet of games. Learn more about the people of the world through analphabet of the five corners of the world, as well as one ofsoldiers arranged and dressed according to rank.

There are, of course, some satirical alphabets that take the idea of an educational ABC and take it on a witty journey - see thealphabet of Paris’ grotesque criesand acomic alphabetfrom the Netherlands.

And for a bit of relaxation, here’s one for anyone hooked on this year’s leisure time must-do activity - analphabet to colour inyourself.

Explore over 9,000 results for‘alphabet’ on Europeana. Here are just a few...

Europeana talks a lot about encouraging the reuse of its collections by professionals in the creative industries. I’m a fiction writer. As such, I’d consider myself part of the creative industries. So, how could I use Europeana’s collections in my creative endeavours?

For artists and designers, the concept of using whole parts or aspects of someone else’s artwork seems to be ethically acceptable, provided you give the original the right credit. You’re building on something, you’re being clever, you’re being artistic and design savvy. But with writing, you’re in danger of committing plagiarism. And that’s bad.

You might use a well credited quotation at the beginning of your novel, or even at the head of every chapter. And if you have done specific research, you’ll probably acknowledge that in a foreword or endword, just in case anything’s accidentally crept into your storytelling that someone else might feel comes from their work. But that’s as much literary re-use as most writers would be comfortable with. Because plagiarism is bad. Did I mention that?

To do more than that takes guts. It’s a brave thing to use someone else’s characters or plots. Not least because to be worthwhile, you need to use a character or plot that people are familiar with. That means a successful one. That means you’re in danger of upsetting people by playing with their favourites.

Here are a few examples...

You could ‘re-use’ a famous character - Jane Austen’s Mr Darcy reappears inBridget Jones’s Diaryby Helen Fielding.

I’m not a fan of the book but I do like the way the reference was nicely underlined in the film version by having Colin Firth, who played Jane Austen’s Darcy in the BBC adaptation ofPride and Prejudice, resuming the Darcy role.



'Woman from Pride and Prejudice', British Library, public domain

You could ‘borrow’ a plot the way New York-based musicalWest Side Storyuses the plot of Shakespeare’sRomeo and Juliet, and the filmTen Things I Hate About Youand the musicalKiss Me Kateboth use hisTaming of the Shrew.

Or you can go all out and continue a successful franchise -House of Silkis a new Sherlock Holmes novel not by Arthur Conan Doyle but by Antony Horowitz, which I enjoyed very much.

And one I’m more concerned about is a new story about PG Wodehouse’s iconic butler Jeeves, one of my absolute favourite characters.Jeeves and the Wedding Bellsis written by Sebastian Faulks - I’m hoping it’s a winner as Faulks is no stranger to franchises having written a new James Bond novel,Devil May Care.

As a child, I loved the Famous Five books by Enid Blyton, and once I’d finished all 21, I read a few of Frenchman Claude Voilier series continuing the five’s adventures. I was always disappointed. Something just wasn’t quite right. That’s the danger. That’s why I’m worried about my Jeeves.

So, how about going one step further and stealing not just characters, plots and premises, but the exact words another author has used? That’s exactly what Seth Grahame-Smith did to create the parody mash-upPride and Prejudice and Zombies.



‘Elizabeth from Pride and Prejudice’, British Library, public domain

Here’s Jane Austen’s original opening:

It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife. However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters. "My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?" Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.



‘Poppenkast Pantijn (pop: zombie)’, Amsterdam Museum, CC BY.

And here it is plus zombies:

It is a truth universally acknowledged that a zombie in possession of brains must be in want of more brains. Never was this truth more plain than during the recent attacks at Netherfield Park, in which a household of eighteen was slaughtered and consumed by a horde of the living dead. "My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is occupied again?" Mr. Bennet replied that he had not and went about his morning business of dagger sharpening and musket polishing - for attacks by the unmentionables had grown alarmingly frequent in recent weeks.

Amazon.com even has a 'Mash-ups' section within its Literature > Genre Fiction category. There are 563 titles currently, including three Star Wars stories a la the Bard -William Shakespeare’s The Empire Striketh Back,The Clone Army Attackethand Tragedy of the Sith’s Revenge.

Is all this re-hashing and re-mixing simply writers being lazy, or is it the very essence of what storytelling is all about? It’s about passing a good yarn down from generation to generation. A good story is a good story. Great characters are great characters. So finding ways to introduce them to new audiences seems like a natural thing to do.

And of course there’s a theory that there areonly seven storiesyou can tell, so maybe no novel can be said to be completely original. They’re all mash-ups.

Creatures of literature and folklore

Dragons have played the role of bad guy in many a Western folk story or legend. They’ve been part of our literature and folklore as far back as we can remember (there’s one in Beowulf), and are still pervasive in our culture today.

You probably heard the story about St George slaying a dragon. But did you know Hercules slew one too? And how about St Margaret of Antioch? She refused to marry a man who wanted her to renounce her Christianity. As punishment, she was gobbled up by Satan disguising himself as a dragon. But lo and behold, she gave the dragon a dig with the cross she wore, which irritated him so much he threw her back up.

I think dragons are also pretty cool simply because they give us the opportunity to use the word ‘slew’. You don’t just ‘kill’ a dragon, or ‘put it down’. I will slay. I slew. It was slain. The very declension of the verb evokes sword-wielding olden times.

But our fearsome dragons are a far cry from those depicted in Far Eastern art, where they usually symbolise potency, cosmic energy and good luck. These two sets of dragons even have different ‘designs’, with those in the Chinese style being more serpent-like, and our European ones having wings.

Here’s a question for you - how many countries have a dragon on their flag? Answer at the bottom of this blog.

Did you know that Harry Potter’s nemesis Draco Malfoy is named after a dragon? Draco is the Latin word for dragon. Not quite a dragon but still pretty nasty, there was a Draco in the 7th century BC who was a legislator in Athens, notorious for handing out the death penalty. He gives us the word ‘draconian’. There’s also a Draco constellation that those of us in the northern hemisphere can see all year round - this is the one that Hercules killed. I mean slew.

For the images below, I’ve picked out a range of dragons from Europeana. Some fierce. Some brutal. Some smooth and scaly. Some feathery and furry. Some actually quite cute. And if you’re wondering, the seven-headed dragon that appears twice is the dragon from Revelations Chapter 12: ‘And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.’

Teaser answer:Three: Wales, Bhutan and Malta (St George and the dragon are represented on the Maltese flag’s George Cross emblem).

Recording Irish traditional instrumental music, song & dance

As well as collecting the contemporary and historic materials of Irish traditional music published by others, theIrish Traditional Music Archive (ITMA)has, for the past twenty-three years, operated an annual programme of audio and video field and studio recording of singers, musicians and dancers. ITMA is now delighted to be part of the Europeana Sounds project where these recordings can be shared with a wider audience throughout the continent of Europe and further afield.

Field recording has taken place across the island of Ireland, encompassing the various styles & genres of Irish traditional instrumental music, song & dance. It makes audio and video recordings simultaneously using professional HD video cameras; in its earliest years, for reasons of cost, it made audio recordings only.

This programme has recorded some 2,000 performers since 1992, and in addition has recorded lectures, public recitals and concerts, and other traditional music events. The rights to the recordings remain otherwise with the performers. These are available within ITMA for public listening and viewing and a selection is also available inour online collections, such as the two featured in this Europeana Sounds blog.

First ITMA Field Recordings, 1992–93

During the period March 1992 to the end of 1993, twenty-seven recording sessions were carried out, in Clare, Galway, Tipperary and Donegal.

Hereis a selection of these early ITMA field recordings of local performers made by Jackie Small in Cos Clare and Galway featuring music, song and oral history, published on Europeana.

ITMA records at many festivals and summer schools around Ireland, the Willie Clancy Summer School, Miltown Malbay, Co. Clare being just one of these. Since its foundation in 1987, ITMA has had a fruitful recording association with this highly regarded summer school and its musicians. Here is a very popular example of one of these recordings made by ITMA in 2008.

A crucial chapter in World War I

During the summer of 1915, the German and Austro-Hungarian armies were advancing in Galicia and Poland on the Eastern front, causing the Russians heavy casualties and forcing them to retreat. Due to heavy losses in the earlier Gorlice–Tarnów Offensive in May and June, the Russian Army as a whole was already roughly 30% short of its nominal strength and found itself in an exposed position in Poland.

In July, the Central Powers' armies opened a new series of offensives across the entire Eastern front.

The Germans advanced particularly quickly to the far north of Poland and into Lithuania. The Austro-Hungarians finally regained large parts of their territories in Galicia which they had lost during the first months of the war. This included the city of Przemyśl, which had been under siege from the Russians after their crushing defeat of the Austro-Hungarian garrison.

By mid-July 1915, the entire Russian line had been pushed back by as far as 160 km to the Bug River, leaving only a small portion of Poland in Russian hands. On 22 July, the joint armies of the Central Powers crossed the Vistula river. And in August, Warsaw became isolated because of the continuing Russian retreat, offering the German 12th Army the opportunity to conquer the city.

Ongoing attacks by the German armies soon caused the Russian front to collapse and, after having received considerable reinforcements, they took Brest-Litovsk (on 25 August). A month later, Hindenburg's forces captured Vilnius.

The overall advance of the Central Powers on the Eastern front during the summer of 1915 is important, because it marks the beginning of Russia’s later removal from the war in 1917.

Europeana 1914-1918gives you access to a large number of fascinating firsthand accounts of the various events on the Eastern front, like the war diary ofWilhelm Habermann.

Habermann was a so-calledFahnenschmied, a certified blacksmith within the 46th Field Artillery Regiment from Lower Saxony. He took part in actions both on the Western and Eastern front.

On 5 May 1915, he writes in his diary that he considers warfare at the Eastern front easier than in France (‘Das Kriegführen ist hier leichter als in Frankreich’). Habermann ends his diary on 1 August, just after his regiment reached Warsaw.

Another very interesting account of how the German military advanced in Poland and beyond is given by anNCO in the German Railroad Engineering Corpsposted to the Eastern Front. The photos he took during his time at the front give us an insight into the tremendous efforts that were made to keep up, or rather rebuild, the infrastructures to ensure the ongoing logistics of the advance.

And there are also the heartbreaking stories of soldiers who fell far from home. Read thefarewell letterfull of regret and uncertainty that Richard Pick wrote to his wife in March 1915 just before he departed for the Eastern front. It was to be his last letter, as Richard died a few months later, on 15 June 1915.

Or look at thememorabilia of Konrad Mayrthat his children shared with us. At just 16-years-old, he left school to take part in the German war efforts on the Eastern front. He was lucky enough to survive the war, living until 1976.

Also very young but much less fortunate was student-architectMax Klawitter. Eager to escape his father’s home rule, he enlisted in August 1914. He wrote to his parents about his life at the front, and sadly died on 22 June 1915.

You can also read thestory of Staff Surgeon Otto Kaschel, who was awarded a Russian medal for medical services. Or take a look at the pictures thatbaker Willy Fingertook of what he saw at the front.

In addition to these personal stories, watchspectacular footagefrom the Eastern front from original newsreels, with moving images of marching soldiers, destroyed landscapes, tired Russian Prisoners of War and captured artillery.

There is even a complete filmed report on theCapture of Przemyślshot by an Austro-Hungarian army film crew.

It’s easy to take thousands of books on holiday with you these days thanks to the e-reader, a device that can store enough books to keep you reading for months. E-readers are especially great for people who like to read lots of books at once as they automatically remember where you left off last time.

But they’re nothing new.

As early as 1588, the Italian military engineer Agostino Ramelli invented a device that allowed people to read multiple books at the same time, without having to worry about remembering page numbers.

The so-calledbookwheel(or reading wheel) could hold many (heavy) books, so it was possible to change books with minimal effort. The device provided a comfortable reading chair and through a sophisticated mechanism - similar to that of a ferris wheel - the books would remain facing upwards while the wheel turned.

Ramelli’s design was later improved by the French inventor Grollier de Servière, who was born in Lyon and in his youth pursued a military career that took him to Flanders, Germany, Italy and Constantinople.

When he retired, he put his skills to use creating an improved version of the reading wheel.

The baroque painter Peter Paul Rubens was born on this day in 1577.

Known as the 'Prince of Painters', and instantly recognisable for his grand, swirling style, his art now hangs in some of the greatest art galleries and most luxurious public buildings around the world.

If you’ve stood in front of a Rubens painting, it’s an experience you’re unlikely to forget. Often vast in scale, they burst energetically out of their frames, full of sensual details you could almost reach out and touch: flesh ripples and bulges, eyes gleam, hair shimmers invitingly.

Classically educated, and a devout Catholic, Rubens’ paintings often depict stories drawn from the Bible and mythology. Rich with allegory and meaning, the narratives allowed him to exercise his vivid imagination, and paint scenes of immense drama.

Rubens ability to create an atmosphere of drama and tension was impressive.

One example is his famous painting,Daniel in the Lion’s Den, which shows Daniel trapped amongst ten fearsome lions. To achieve the terrifying composition, he carefully studied the animal’s form through sketches and preparatory drawings.

Of course, seeing a lion in 17th century Flanders was no easy task, but as a court painter, Rubens had access to the Royal Menagerie in Brussels. There were also two, named Flandria and Brabantia, at the zoo in Ghent.

Rubens studies of the animals show a fascinating perspective of the theatrical painter and his working processes. You start to understand his meticulous approach to form and movement, and sense the aspects of nature that drew his eye.

As art lovers and historians celebrate the life and work of this flamboyant painter, why not take the opportunity to explore some of his more understated works which together offer a subtle testament to the talent beneath the dramatic display.

Today, Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholics and Anglicans celebrate the birth of St. John the Baptist. But have you heard about St. John's Dance?

In 1374, on the streets of Aachen, Germany, people started dancing involuntarily. They moved frantically until near the point of total exhaustion. Within weeks this strange compulsion spread to the Netherlands and north-east of France. Hundreds of people uncontrollably jumped, leapt and twitched for days.

This phenomenon is called dance mania, the dancing plague, or St John's Dance (sometimes St. Vitus' Dance) as it was considered to be a curse sent by a saint.

As unbelievable as it seems, it happened repeatedly in the area along the Rhine.

There are other cases of similar outbreaks documented. First, one on Christmas Eve in 1021, in the German town of Kölbigk. Later, in 1247, in Erfurt, another German town, and shortly after on a bridge in Maastricht. The latter ended tragically when many of the 200 people involved drowned after the bridge collapsed.

Another well documented occurrence happened when a woman called Frau Troffea started dancing in Strasbourg in July 1518 for weeks on end. She was gradually joined by more and more people and the situation escalated when the city authorities provided a stage and hired musicians in hope of bringing this bizarre crisis to an end.

It seems improbable, but dozen of mediaeval sources from different towns mention the incident from 1374, and there are even municipal orders describing the mania in Strasbourg.

Chronicles agree that people were dancing, and not only shaking. But they were obviously suffering from physical pain, too, as well as having horrible visions and sometimes asking for help and praying. Often, they barely ate or slept and sometimes they were not even conscious of what was happening to them.

The theories of what actually happened to cause these epidemics varied across the centuries.

From religious beliefs about being possessed by devils, to suggestions of the existence of a dancing cult ritual, to a strong suspicion about a mass ergot (a mold growing on the stalks of damp rye) poisoning causing hallucinations and shaking.

However, present-day researchers believe the bizarre outbreaks were examples of mass psychogenic illness triggered by fear and depression. Both manias (1374 and 1518) were preceded by periods of devastating famine, crop failures and the spread of diseases - tough conditions, even by the standards of the Middle Ages. The anxiety and guilt together with a deep superstition, that God is punishing them for their wrongdoing, made people susceptible to this peculiar involuntary state.

Sir Charles Bell and his art from the battlefields

Please note: this blog contains watercolour illustrations of different types of injuries (missing arms, abdomen wounds, etc) received at the Battle of Waterloo. If you prefer not to view this content, please continue to ourStoriessection.

On Sunday June 18 1815, the French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte was defeated during the Battle of Waterloo. Caving to a coalition of mainly British, Dutch and Prussian armies under the command of the Duke of Wellington, the defeat marked the end of one of the bloodiest battles in history.

From 16 to 20 June 1815 a stunning total of 140,000 soldiers fought in the battle, named after its location near a small town not far from Brussels in present-day Belgium - then part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands.

The defeat at Waterloo ended Napoleon's rule as Emperor of the French, but the battle was decisive in more than one sense. It ushered in almost half a century of international peace, material prosperity and technological progress in Europe.

This stability came at a high price, however, and both sides lost thousands of men. On Napoleon's side 24,000 to 26,000 were killed or wounded. In addition, 6,000 to 7,000 soldiers were captured while 15,000 have deserted. The fierce fighting cost the Allied armies dearly too, with around 22,000 dead or wounded troopers by the end.

The gruesome reality of war, and the gravity of the wounds it inflicts, is shown with an unusual frankness in the anatomical sketches and watercolours, of Charles Bell. Bell, a renowned surgeon, anatomist and artist, took part in the Battle of Waterloo as a medical officer. Volunteering as a surgeon, Bell worked tirelessly in the treatment of the wounded, and documented his experiences through his drawings.

In his studies from the Battle, he depicts his patients and their injuries in astonishing detail. The series provide a moving record of the horrific wounds dealt with by army surgeons in Wellington’s army.

As Chair of Anatomy at the Royal Academy, Bell was also a prolific author, and his experiences at Waterloo would go on to help future battlefield surgeons. His combined artistic, scientific and literary talents made him a particularly valuable guide to the realities of war.

Though Bell’s operations in the aftermath of Waterloo were not impressive, with only one of his 12 amputation cases surviving, his artistic skills are clear. Below, you can see a gallery of some of his works from the Battle, though we must warn you – they are not for the fainthearted!

Nowadays, we’re used to billboards and posters advertising the latest exhibitions on the sides of buses and busy street corners. Art is big business, so it’s only natural it’s got a publicity budget to match.

In fact, art posters can even become valuable collectables, fetching huge sums at auction houses around the world. All of this is a relatively modern phenomenon though.

In the 1890s, advances in colour lithography made it easy to print large posters for advertisements and a new trend was born. At the forefront of this new craze was the art nouveau movement and, particularly, the Salon des Cent, an ongoing commercial art exhibition housed at 31 Rue Bonaparte in Paris.

The Salon des Cent was, as its name suggests, an ever-changing show of 100 artists.

With no criteria given for what could go on display, and established figures featured alongside little known names, it was an exciting forum for experimentation and new aesthetic approaches.

Some artists became regular fixtures; recurring names included Toulouse Lautrec, Alphonse Mucha and Eugene Grasset. Perhaps the Salon’s most famous legacy, however, is the vast collection of posters produced to publicise its exhibitions, each commissioned by a participating artist.

These posters are now considered important art nouveau works in their own right, and some of the first examples of using advertising and other mainstream mediums to create decorative art. By turning the street into an art gallery for the everyday passer-by, the artists fulfilled their aim of creating 'social art'.

You can explore awhole range of beautiful examples from our collections, or look at some of our favourites below.

As a child in 1980s Britain, several books and TV shows captured my imagination with their little people and tiny houses. Bagpuss. Tottie - the Story of a Doll’s House. And my very favourite, The Borrowers. Imagine being so small, the whole world being so big. I imagined these people existed, under my floorboards, amongst my toys.

My dolls came alive when I wasn’t looking. By extension, I just love doll’s houses. Being able to see into a whole building is really rather voyeuristic. Like walking down a residential street at dusk, the front rooms brightly lit but the curtains not yet drawn - a brief glimpse into strangers’ lives.

With a doll’s house, you don’t just see it, you get to control it. Every room, every character. And you see everything that goes on - the wealthy lords and ladies up in the drawing room and the lowly cooks and maids below stairs.

And all those tiny pieces of furniture. How do fat-fingered grown-up human beings even make them? Maybe it’s part of the training programme to become a keyhole surgeon? I mean, look at these minute baskets - who can weave that small?

On Europeana, I’ve found some really beautiful and clearly well-loved doll’s houses along with some gorgeous furniture, crockery, dolls and clothes to match.

I love the old-fashioned ones the best, like this lovely highchair and what’s billed as ‘the world’s smallest medicine chest’.

The dodo

The great auk

The bluebuck antelope

The woolly rhino

The Javan tiger

What are famous animals that have become extinct?

We all know that animals are becoming extinct all the time. But did you know that if you average everything out, new species come into being at about the same rate as old ones become extinct?

Well, that was the case until recently. Through the 20th century and into the 21st, the rate of extinction has sped up at a frightening pace.

Now, one in four mammals, one in eight birds and one in three amphibians are at risk of extinction. 40% of the species on earth are in danger.

A biologist from Harvard, called Edward O. Wilson, predicts that half of all plant and animal species will be gone by the year 2100.

Why? Because of us. These are the effect of us humans destroying habitats, changing the climate, introducing modified and invasive species and developing agriculture in such an intensive way.

Here’s just a small glimpse at some of the fascinating creatures we’ve already lost.

This funny looking bird that couldn’t fly lived on the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. It stood about one metre tall.

They became extinct somewhere between 1688 and 1715. Their decline was a result of more humans setting up life on Mauritius, destroying the dodo’s habitat and bringing with them other animals such as pigs and macaques.



This is a reconstruction of a Dodo - we don’t know exactly what they looked like as they became extinct before the invention of the camera and there are no complete specimens for us to look at.



The great auk is another flightless bird, this one is from the north Atlantic.

Although it looks like a penguin, is part of the genusPinguinusand was the first bird to called a penguin, it’s actually not a penguin. While it’s hard to say when the dodo became extinct, it’s easy with the great auk. The last ones were killed off the coast of Iceland on 3 July 1844.



Did you know you could tell the seasons by looking at a great auk? In summer, it developed a white patch over each eye. And in winter, those patches disappeared and it got a white band between the eyes.

The bluebuck antelope was hunted to extinction around 1800, despite its flesh not being particularly tasty. It lived in South Africa and the ‘blue’ in its name is thought to come from the visual effect of having both black and yellow hairs in its coat.

If you want to see a real bluebuck skin in a museum, there are only four places in the world where you can - Leiden, Paris, Stockholm or Vienna.



You’ve heard of a woolly mammoth, but what about a woolly rhino?

The woolly rhino was common throughout Europe and northern Asia from about 2,588,000 to 11,700 years ago. The oldest woolly rhino fossil dates back 3.6 million years. It is thought to have become extinct because of a combination of climate change at the end of an ice age and human hunting.



The Javan tiger is the most recent of our selection, having survived until the mid-1970s.



As its name suggests, it lived on the Indonesian island of Java. The Javan tiger was fairly small and very stripy.

They died out because the human population of Java increased and so did the proportion of land being used to cultivate food stuffs like rice. By 1975, only 8% of the island was forest. Despite the tiger being officially declared extinct, some people remain convinced they still exist, with sightings rumoured as recently as 2010.

How HMS Erebus and Terror were lost in the search for the Northwest Passage



HMS Erebus in the Ice

On the cloudy morning of 19 May 1845 - a small town, Greenhithe, in England’s Southeastern tip, was a hive of excitement and activity. Festivities were focused around the town’s dock where two great ships -HMS ErebusandTerror- were preparing to cast off. Their destination? The still-uncharted Northwest Passage of the Arctic, where the Atlantic and Pacific seas meet.

The two ships’ crews, numbering 129 men, and their captain John Franklin were united in enthusiasm for the year-long voyage ahead. Successfully finding the fabled passage would be a historic maritime discovery, crucial for traders all over the world.



Sir John Franklin

Their voyage, however, was doomed and the men were never seen again. The ships were only finally found in 2014, by a Canadian marine archaeologist.

In the intervening years, the mystery endured as a source of national and international intrigue, particularly so in the decades just after the disappearance. Numerous search parties set off, and though they found sometimes found clues, they failed to yield any satisfying answers.

Below, you can see some of the different items found by the search expeditions - poignant remnants of the lives on board.



One Scottish explorer, John Rae, came closer to a detailed explanation of the ships' fate. On his trip to the region, he not only obtained a number of salvaged items from the ships from the local Inuit communities, some of which you can see below, but shocking witness accounts too.



The Inuit Rae interviewed reported that the boats became trapped in ice, and the men, faced with starvation, resorted to cannibalism before eventually perishing in the terrible Arctic conditions.

The story horrified Victorian society, and Franklin’s wife, Jane, and the eminent novelist Charles Dickens campaigned to have the story denounced, suggesting instead that the 'savage' Inuit killed the men.

As you can expect, the horror and mystery of this tragic tale inspired artists and writers across Europe for generations to come, and you can find many different depictions relating to the voyage in our collections, frombooksand maps, paintings tomagic lantern slides.

Below, you can see some highlights we have selected, including a map of HMS Erebus' lower deck, now helpful to archaeologists excavating the ships.

Finding fairytales in Europeana

How old were you before a cracked mirror no longer filled you with dread? And a forest no longer conjured up thoughts of witches and wolves? Even if we haven’t read them for many years, fairytales enter our psyche in a very special way. Tomorrow, it will be 312 years since the death of Charles Perrault, the father of the modern fairytale. It's perhaps not a date nor a name that mean very much, but the influence of this man, and his vivid contribution to our collective imagination, have little diminished since his death in 1703.



Along with maybe better-known writers like Hans Christian Andersen and the Brothers Grimm, you can thank Perrault for many of your most cherished childhood stories. A subversive at heart, and a critic of Louis XIV’s court, he rescued popular oral tales from disappearing into the mists of time, immortalising them in a slim volume of tales published at the end of the seventeenth century.





The book was a huge success, and Perrault became a well-known figure in Paris’ literary circles. Even if you haven’tread Perrault’s book, you’ll know his characters well, from Little Red Riding Hood and the fearsome wolf, to the pirate Blue Beard and Cinderella.



So why do these tales endure? Well, there are lots of theories; some suggest they tap into our buried urges and deepest fears, while others read them as timeless tales of good and bad, teaching children, and society at large, what makes right from wrong. As these different objects from our collections show, the stories take the real world and real people and give them a fantastical twist. Numbers, colours and everyday objects acquire mystical powers - threes and sevens spell luck and magic, while shiny red apples become synonymous with danger.

Andersen's The Little Mermaid, some papercut figures inspired by his tales, and a copy of Grimm's Fairytales.Snow White, a German fairytale, first published by the Brothers Grimm in 1812.

Whatever their hidden meanings, it's clear from a journey through our collections just how much they’ve captivated imaginations of storytellers, actors, painters and writers across Europe. A book of fairytales is often one of the first things a child will own, no matter where they live, and it offers them a pass into the world of our shared cultural heritage. So, which tale did you love the most?

How the European Union was set in motion in 1950



To those of us who live here, the European Union is something that we argue about - who’s in, who’s out, who’s in charge - but ultimately, I think, something we take for granted as a way of organising and maximising trade and quality of life in this part of the world. Certainly for anyone under 50 or so, this is the way it’s always been.

But it had to start somewhere, and today we celebrate one of its founding fathers, Robert Schuman (not to be confused with German composer, Robert Schumann!). 9 May is Europe Day, which commemorates the signing of the Schuman Declaration on 9 May 1950.

Following two world wars, both of which devastated countries within Europe, leaders across the continent were keen to work together, co-operating to build a better future. Schuman, then French Foreign Minister, proposed a new way of organising the states of Europe, unifying them, and transforming life and trade within them. The coal and steel industries of separate countries would all be placed under a common authority. There would be a single market ethos to revitalise the economies of both Europe and the wider world. There would be a world first - an international anti-cartel agency. And as a political entity, Europe would control things like justice at a higher level than within individual countries so that the likes of the atrocities of the second world war could never happen again. The European Coal and Steel Community was created as a result of the Schuman declaration. Then came several other European Communities and ultimately the European Union itself.

But it was about more than trade. The Schuman declaration also aimed to make war between Europe’s member states impossible and to promote world peace. Peace even in one continent is a challenging ambition but, it turns out, an achievable one - in 2012, nearly 50 years after Schuman’s death, the European Union won theNobel Peace Prizefor "for over six decades [having] contributed to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe".

World peace is never a wasted wish when blowing out your birthday candles, or entering the Miss World beauty pageant. But we never really expect that wish to work. Schuman did, and he did something about it. For that, I, as a European, am grateful. Happy Europe Day!

By collecting together untold stories of this historic war,Europeana 1914-1918offers many opportunities to look at familiar events from new and different perspective, and from both sides of the battle lines. As Anzac Day, the most significant day commemorating the loss of life during the Gallipoli campaign approaches, we want to take a look at the conflict from an alternative angle and begin with the story of a single soldier, Paul Nowarka, whose story was contributed to Europeana 1914-1918 by his relatives.

Paul Nowarka is his Turkish uniform (CC-BY-SA Europeana1914-1918/Paul Nowarka)

In 1915, Paul Nowarka, a twenty-year-old man from Upper Silesia (today Szobiszowice, a suburb of Gliwice, Poland), headed to Turkey with his unit, a small airforce which had been sent to fight the British on the Gallipoli peninsula in what was then the Ottoman Empire. Nowarka had first joined the war as a mechanic in theFlieger-Ersatz-Abteilung Nr. 12in Cottbus, later becoming a pilot doing reconnaissance flights on the Western front in France. His unit in Gallipoli formed part of a wider anti-Russian alliance, first started by Germany and Turkey shortly before the actual outbreak of the war in 1914 during the Sarajevo Crisis. Nowarka had already impressed his seniors, and his work in France earned him an Iron Cross Second Class, as well as a promotion to the rank of Gefreiter (Corporal).

By the time he was sent to Turkey, the Gallipoli Campaign had already started, kicking off in April 2015, and soon becoming one of the fiercest and most notorious theatres of battle during the First World War. Nowarka’s achievements in these battles continued to impress, and he was awarded theEiserner Halbmondor Iron Crescent by Lieutenant General Liman von Sanders, a German officer who had been head of the Military Mission sent to advise Turkey.

The Gallipoli Campaign is sometimes known as the Dardanelles Campaign, named after the strait between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean where it happened. The strait was of great strategic importance to the Russian Empire, which explains why, in 1915, Russia’s allies Britain and France launched a naval attack intending to secure it. The Ottomans prepared to repel the attack with the Ottoman Fifth Army, a conscript force, commanded by Liman von Sanders and overseen by a number of other senior German officers.

On 25 April, there was an amphibious landing on the peninsula, with the ambitious aim to capture the Ottoman capital of Constantinople (now Istanbul). The attack was repelled and the invasion attempt was abandoned after eight months of heavy fighting, and many casualties on both sides. It is believed that, by the time the Gallipoli Campaign ended, over 100,000 men were dead. The date of the landing, 25 April, is now ‘Anzac Day’, and it is the most significant commemoration of military casualties and veterans in Australia and New Zealand.

Prior to the naval attack, the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) and New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) were formed into the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) and integrated in the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force (MEF) that was to carry out the mission.

Explore these miniature artworks from Japan

Netsuke, the small sculptural objects worn by men in Japan since the 17th century, first shot to fame in Europe with the publication of Edmund de Waal’s popular memoir,The Hare With Amber Eyesin 2010.

As de Waal recounts his unusual story of inheritance, namely a collection of 264 netsuke from a great uncle, Iggie, these miniature artworks began to capture the imagination of readers all over the world.

An illustration with a netsuke in the form of a hare.

They already have, however, a long history as part of everyday life in Japan, and have been collected and traded all over the world for centuries.

Designed to endure, and utilitarian in function, netsuke became a way for men to demonstrate class, taste and wealth, with a desired effect little different to the glint of an expensive watch or the sheen of a silk tie. They were attached to cords to secure tobacco pouches or purses as you can see in the print below, necessary because kimono have no pockets.

In this case, the man has one in the shape of a rat, representing the lucky god, Daikoku.



Each one, crafted from ivory, bone or finely grained wood, offers an exquisite depiction of a moment caught in time, with inspiration drawn from nature, daily life, religion and myth.

Some netsuke can be incredibly elaborate, and depict a whole scene rather than just a single figure or animal, while others are enchanting in their simplicity.

You can explore hundreds of superb examples of theseminiature masterpieces via Europeana. Which one would you wear?

How newsreels told the story of World War I

Nowadays there’s news breaking everywhere we go; there’s no escape. We have access to the latest stories at any time, in any place, in any form. We read it, see it, hear it all day. This omnipresence has made us into what we like to call ‘news junkies’, always hungry for more.

A century ago, this was not the case. There were, of course, daily newspapers, and in turbulent times there could even be several editions a day. There was no radio yet, but people could go to the cinema to see the latest headlines.

Amidst a great variety of entertainment, people had the opportunity to see a weekly newsreel, with various items from all over the world.

Have a look atthis newsreelfrom the first week of April 1915 to see what was considered news and the way it was shown.

Obviously, there was a huge war going on, and it had been raging for a couple of months now. It hadn’t ended before Christmas 1914 as so many people had believed it would at first. In fact, the conflict was growing and now affected most of Europe.

In Germany and its allied countries (Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire, the so called Central powers in World War I) the Messter Woche news reel was very popular. It was the major source of visual information about the war.http://player.vimeo.com/video/48867768?iframe=true&width=100%&height=100%

The film was produced by Messter Film, a German film production company. It was founded by the German film pioneer Oskar Messter and based in Berlin which had emerged as the centre of the German film industry. Messter quickly established itself as dominant force in German production, particularly during the boom years of the First World War when foreign films faced many restrictions in Germany.

Otto von Bismarck

Cinema was still relatively new, but nations were quick to recognise its ability to spread messages and influence mass sentiment at the start of World War I. The early years of the war were still experimental in regard to using films as a propaganda tool, but it would become an important instrument to manipulate people and their perceptions of the conflict.

Crossing a mountain range on skis

Germany was one of the first nations to effectively use the film industry for national causes. The German industry expanded enormously during World War I and Kaiser Wilhelm II was the biggest movie star of that period.

Burning trenches as a result of enemy fire

You can see for yourself how news reels gradually became pure propaganda tools.

Via theEuropean Film Gateway, many European film archives have contributed around 3,000 historic films related to World War I, and not just newsreels, but also other genres like documentaries, fiction and propaganda.

With its sheer cliffs and glassy waters, the archipelago St Kilda sits at the northern tip of the British isles, the westernmost part of the Outer Hebridean islands.

As you might expect from such a far-flung location, the distance from the mainland plays an important role in the island’s history.



The population of St Kilda has always been small, rarely exceeding a hundred people, and visitors seldom make it across the notoriously rough seas.

In August 1930, it was evacuated altogether after the remaining community of 36 St Kildans wrote to the government asking for help to start a new life on the mainland.

Much of life on the islands was steeped in tradition for many centuries. St Kildans lived on a diet of seabirds and produce native to the island, and after each house was provided a loom, woven fabrics like tweed became the main export.

Below, you can see some pictures from the University of Edinburgh which capture life on this unusual isle.













As some digging through Europeana's collections about St. Kilda will reveal, during the 18th century, the island had a more unsettling story to tell.

From 1734 to 1740, Rachel Erskine, or Lady Grange as she was known, was confined on the island, sent there by her husband, James Erskine of Grange.

Lord Grange was a prominent judge, but had secret Jacobite sympathies - highly controversial for a public figure at the time. Fearing his wife knew too much about his treasonous plotting, he banished her to the remote isles so she could not betray him.

Lady Grange’s letters, written during her unhappy years on St Kilda and smuggled off the island, areavailable from the University of Edinburgh.



They tell her fascinating story in her own hand.In one, she writes to her husbandtrying to persuade him to allow her return: 'I will retire and live by myself… and shall not trouble you nor set my foot within your doors… I am your unfortunate… obedient wife'.

Another reads, 'I am the unfortunate wife of Mr James Erskine of Grange… after I had lived 25 years in great love and peace, he all of a sudden took a dislike to my person'.

Though there are no permanent residents on the islands any more, there’s still plenty to find out about this mysterious place and the tales it has to tell. You can access the open collections of the University of Edinburgh as well as material from other institutionsvia Europeana hereto discover more.

How the Irish celebrate St. Patrick's Day

Every year, on 17 March, Irish communities around the world celebrate St. Patrick's Day, or the feast of Saint Patrick. As St. Patrick is the patron saint of Ireland, the day is both a cultural and religious celebration, and an important day in the Irish cultural calendar. To celebrate, we’ve explored the history of the holiday and some of the Irish artefacts you can find in our collections.

Festivities include big parades, ceilidhs, and the wearing of green clothes and shamrocks, or sprigs of clover. St. Patrick is believed to have used clover to represent the Holy Trinity when he brought Christianity to the country, so the plant has a special status and is strongly associated with luck. In this woodcut, you can see why St. Patrick is considered to be the heroic protector of Ireland. The illustration retells the legend of how he drove all the snakes out of Ireland, and saved the Irish people from a plague of reptiles and demons.



In this sketch, a woman distributes shamrocks to wounded Irish soldiers on a busy hospital ward during the Boer War. It was published in 1900, the same year that Queen Victoria authorised that all Irish regiments could wear shamrocks on their uniform to celebrate St. Patrick - a gesture of gratitude for their service in the war.



Irish regiments have long played an important role in British war efforts. Here is a letter by an Irish soldier Michael O'Rourke contributed during Europeana 1914-1918 by a relative. He talks about how his parents are both “in my mind now, on St Patrick’s Day”.



Songs are an important part of all Irish celebrations, and you can learn quite a few from exploring our collections. Here, you can see a songsheet with some popular traditional ballads.



If you'd like to find out more, you can read a blog on Europeana Sounds about Irish musichere. There's lots more to discover about the Emerald Isle via Europeana. Why not celebrate the luck of the Irish and see what you can find.

How suffrage became an important pan-European movement

With International Women’s Day 2015 approaching, we’ve decided to take a look at the history of women’s rights in Europe. The rights both sexes in Europe enjoy today are the product of some hard fought battles. Europeana stores objects and images relating to a number of important activism campaigns, each of which has made important contributions to the wider struggle for women's equality with men. At the end of the nineteenth century, women’s right to vote was a central political question, and the suffrage movement became an important pan-European movement.



As this cartoon from Punch, a satirical magazine, shows, lots of women from all walks of life took part in protests, many of which were ruthlessly suppressed by police.



Though the cartoon chooses to take a lighthearted perspective on things, relations between police and protesters were often tense. Women were frequently jailed for their protest activities. This photo from the National Library of France shows how roughly they were sometimes treated, with one activist in Wales physically restrained by a group of police officers.



It was this brutal treatment, however, that help to win the public's support. As women then became vital to the war efforts of many nations during World War One, questions about their rights began to be addressed. You can find out more about the work women did during the war throughour story on Mashable. Here, you can see members of Dansk Kvindesamfund, or The Danish Women’s Society, the world’s oldest women’s rights organisation, marching in 1915. It was this same year that they were granted the right to vote in national elections - an important milestone in the European campaign for equal rights.



Europeana includes a number of important figures from the wider movement, such as Hubertine Auclert, who tirelessly campaigned for equal rights until her death in 1914.



Below is a portrait of Hedwig Dohm, a German author who was one of the first feminist theorists to understand gender roles as socially, rather than biologically, determined.



Aletta Jacobs, a Dutch campaigner, is another key figure whom you can find out more about in Europeana. Jacobs helped initiate the Hague Congress of 1915, which led to the creation of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF). Here, you can see her fan, brought back from Shanghai.



The fan is part of theAtria collection, highlighted in anotherblog of ours, which contains numerous important objects from both the Dutch and international women’s rights movements. Many of the objects in this collection are designed to be shared.

As this so powerfully shows, it was not only famous names that forged equality for European women, but solidarity across nations and the continent. Together, the women of Europe proved that their demands could no longer be ignored.

How previously unseen footage was discovered

A Phd candidate from the University of Illinois in Chicago has uncovered previously unseen footage of the Eastland Disaster in Chicago onEuropeana. The disaster, which killed 844 people, occurred when the Eastland capsized in the Chicago river in July 1915.

Jeff Nichols was actually gathering material for his doctoral dissertation on World War I when he made the historic discovery.

While watching Dutch news reels from 1915, he chanced across the coverage of the disaster and realised at once what an exciting find he had made.

'I consider myself a Chicago historian, but I am not an historian of the Eastland Disaster. There are many people who have worked very hard studying the tragedy. But I knew instantly what I had.'

The footage came to Europeana from the EYE Film Institute via the European Film Gateway, which has provided over 600 hours of archive footage to Europeana, and shows the immediate aftermath of the disaster.

The first clip, which is just under a minute, shows the first responders walking on the ship’s hull, while the second clip shows the ship as it is righted.

You can watch the clips on our websitehereandhere.

It is an important discovery for American history, and the story has captured the attention of the world’s media, picked up by news outlets likeThe Washington Postandthe Daily Mailin the United Kingdom.

In the video below, Jeff talks to CBS about the 'Holy Cow' moment when he discovered the footage. For Jeff, an important part of the story of the discovery is that 'it would have been impossible… just a few years ago'.

Though historians suspected some surviving footage might exist, knowing where to hunt for it had been a difficult task. The material Europeana provides access to has helped to enrich his research on World War I in other ways, too. Jeff also unearthed a number of important handwritten letters that he could never have otherwise found.

I could not possibly expect to ask multiple European archives to see if they had any letters from Chicago or if they had any letters that mentioned a handful of American journalists. I would never have asked them to send me copies of the letters for free. That is what your website does. As fantastic a tool as Google is for my research, I wouldn’t have been able to find the items there.'

Europeanaallows people to explore untold stories from World War I, and brings together material from archives and libraries all over the world with the memories and memorabilia of families throughout Europe.

There are plenty of exciting discoveries like Jeff’s to be made on Europeana. Let his story of the Eastland Disaster inspire you as you make your own.

Famous Radio Broadcasts

The Future of Radio

How a groundbreaking invention changed the world

The birth of radio was a groundbreaking invention for both physics and communications, changing the way the world sent and received information forever.

Today, the idea of a simple AM/FM radio seems highly outdated. However, in 2012, UNESCO named February 13 as World Radio Day, commemorating the establishment of United Nations Radio on this day in 1946.

Their first call sign? “This is the United Nations calling the peoples of the world”.

The existence of radio waves was first theorised in 1865 by a Scottish physicist called James Clerk Maxwell. Not long after Maxwell published his findings inA Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field, the German physicist Heinrich Hertz proved the theory to be true, and demonstrated that radio waves were in fact a form of light.

This discovery explains why we now measure wave frequency in Hertz. BothMaxwellandHertz’scollected works can be found on Europeana.

Below, you can see Radio Kootwijk, which was once used for long-range radio communication between the Netherlands and its colonies in the Dutch East Indies. Beneath that is a two pipe radio receiver with battery and feedback coils created by the BBC in 1925.



In the centuries since its invention, radio broadcasts have captured and transmitted the most momentous milestones in the history of the 20th and 21st century. Some broadcasts have even become iconic milestones themselves.

On October 30 1938, Orson Welles made an infamous broadcast of H.G. Wells’The War of the Worlds. Believing the world truly was being invaded by violent extra-terrestrials, panic spread through the American population, and through the media too.

Another memorable broadcast you might enjoy is Winston Churchill’s celebrated speech,‘We shall fight them on the beaches’, in which he rallied the British public to prepare for war on home soil.





Although radios are found less and less frequently in people’s homes and cars, this doesn’t mean the end of radio technology in our everyday lives.

The discovery of radio waves has paved the way for the wireless technology that shapes much of what we do today.

Your wifi connection? Thanks to radio waves. Impressive images from faraway galaxies? That’s down to radio waves too. Your mobile phone? Television broadcasts? You guessed it! They’re all reliant on radio waves.

Whether or not you still tune in to your local station, there's plenty to celebrate this World Radio Day!

Marking the birthday of scientist Charles Darwin

Today marks the 206th birthday of scientist Charles Darwin. He was only 22 years old when he set off for the Pacific aboard HMS Beagle in 1831, embarking on what would become one of the most famous scientific voyages in history.

Now, 12 February each year has become a day to celebrate intellectual curiosity and the tireless pursuit of truth.

It is a good opportunity, too, to learn more about the life of this extraordinary man. Or, why not search our collections, where you can discover all sorts of objects and images that will tell you more about him.

There are numerous highlights to be found, such as a striking portrait taken of him by Julia Margaret Cameron, a photographer whom he stayed with on the Isle of Wight. Darwin thought highly of Cameron’s work, and signed one of her prints with an inscription that he liked it 'very much better than any other which has been taken of me'.



Though most are familiar with Darwin's appearance as an older man with his distinctive white beard, you can also see how he looked as a young boy, posing obediently with his younger sister, Catherine.

It was at this age that Darwin's love of the natural world began to form, and he spent much of his free time searching his father's gardens for interesting insects and plants to study. He and his brother Erasmus also built a laboratory in the garden shed.



University students might be interested to see his lecture card from his days as a medical student in Edinburgh. This card probably brought back some unpleasant memories, though: Darwin left the profession while still a young man due to his squeamishness about blood and human suffering.



For those hard at work on their own breakthrough, you might enjoy looking at the photographs of his private study in Down House, his home in Kent, where he worked on his most iconic work, ‘On the Origin of Species’.





Whether you’re a scientist or a school student, there’s plenty to discover in our collections. Set off on your own voyage, and see what evolves.

Explore a fabulous fashion collection

The years between 1900 and 1939 represent an extremely turbulent time in history with two World Wars and the rise of the suffrage movement. These unstable times clearly had an impact on women's fashion.

This was seen in the rise and fall of hemlines, colour palettes and general relaxing of previously constricting clothing.

With the start of World War II in 1939, fashion became less of a concern. On Europeana we found a great collection of fashion drawings made in the late 1930s. We're highlighting some of these colourful sketches below.

On 14 November 1840, one of the founders of the Impressionism movement was born on the fifth floor of 45 rue Laffitte, in the ninth arrondissement of Paris.

Oscar-Claude Monet started this movement along with his friends Renoir, Sisley and Bazille.

The famous French painter rejected the traditional approach to landscape painting, instead of copying old masters, he observed variations of color and light caused by the daily or seasonal changes.

Below we're highlighting some historical pictures of Monet painting in his atelier in 1926, and some of his colourful works. Explore more of his workthrough Europeana.

The crucial role of medical facilities in World War I

After the First World War started, the flow of casualties soon overwhelmed the existing medical facilities. Large numbers of public and private buildings (often large houses) were turned over for use as small hospitals, most of which operated as annexes to nearby larger hospitals. Some hospitals were developed as, or became specialist units.

Categories of specialism included mental hospitals, units for limbless men, neurological units, orthopaedic units, cardiac units, typhoid units and venereal disease. In March 1915, convalescent hospitals were formed, these establishments helped soldiers recover under military control.

Below we're highlighting some photographs that were taken in hospitals during WW1. ExploreEuropeanafor ore historical photographs.

Fashion at the races in Roaring Twenties Paris

Where better to show off your new outfit than in a chic neighbourhood in the west of Paris?

Longchamp was a popular horse racing track in the French capital. Races were first run there in 1857. By the 1920s, it was the perfect place for designers and fashion lovers to show their new outfit.

The early 1900s saw the flowering of Parisian haute couture as the arbiter of styles and silhouettes for women of all classes. Designers would sendfashion models or mannequins to the Longchamp races, wearing the latest styles.

During the event, fashion photographs were taken to identify and celebrate the creators of individual gowns. Take a look below to enjoy Paris fashion of the 1920s.

Material culture and feminism

Since a few years and to a growing extent, objects form an additional source for historical research. Digitisation makes the material easily accessible for research. The objects collection of Atria consists of over 1700 objects that are related with the Dutch and international women’s movements and women’s organisations.

A number of objects come from personal archives of women who played an important role in the emancipation of women and/or the suffragette movement in The Netherlands and abroad.

A nice example are:the fanor thewriting folderof Aletta Jacobs (1854-1929), the first female medical doctor and leading suffragette, who played an important role in the achievement of voting rights for women in The Netherlands from 1900 until 1919.

To learn more about Aletta Jacobs, take a look at Europeana's online exhibition about remarkable womenPioneers.

In the collection, one finds lots of obvious objects, the typical heritage material of many social movements everywhere: banners, pins, ribbons, buttons, bags, T-shirts etcetera.

Quite remarkable is the number of contraceptives, portraits, games and stamps. Really interesting are the unique pieces that commemorate historical events from the (Dutch) emancipation movement, such as for example the National Exhibition of Women’s Labour in 1898, the exhibition ‘Woman 1813-1913’ or the protest-actions from Dolle Mina (Mad Mina) in the seventies of the last century.

Discover the Dutch dish kapsalon and learn about its origins

Rotterdam is home to a gorgeous harbour, no-nonsense citizens, multiculturalism and quirky architecture. What you may not know about this Dutch city is its contribution to the world's fast-food heritage –kapsalon, meaning barbershop.

The dish is believed to have been invented by a barber from the El Aviva barbershop. He asked the Turkish lunchroom across the street to make a dish with his favourite things – shavings of kebab meat, fries, melted cheese and salad. And sokapsalonwas born!

These photographs are part of a series by Dutch photographer Joris den Blaauwen. He was commissioned byMuseum Rotterdamto document snack and fast-food culture in the city.

What was 'bicycle face'?

When did women start cycling?

It is hard to imagine that just a little over a century ago, women were discouraged from riding their bicycles.

The increasing availability of bicycles brought women mobility and the independence to travel alone. This, of course, threatened the male hegemony.

In the late 19th century, doctors made up a disease called‘Bicycle Face’to discourage women from cycling.

The solution was to scare women into believing that riding bicycles would cause their eyes to bulge, and their chins to jut out due to the strain to keep their balance on the bikes. 'Bicycle face' was usually flushed, but sometimes pale, and always seemed tired. These were considered undesirable female features.

Published articles also aimed to make women believe that excessive cycling made them vulnerable to diseases.

The doctors were also concerned that women riding their bicycles were overly sexual. Riding anything was seen as too masculine for any proper woman or girl.

Many cycling enthusiasts disagreed with 'bicycle face' as a medical condition. Instead, they suggested that physical activity would improve women's health.

Cycling could help riders feel better both physically and emotionally. Cycling could not only make women stronger, it could also make them more confident in their own abilities.

In these late 19th century posters - from theNational Library of France- the women were clearly not suffering from 'bicycle face'!

The world's most famous cycling race

Every year, the Tour de France is watched by audiences in 190 countries and attracts over 15 million spectators. A lot has changed since the first Tour de France in 1903. The first Tour contained only 6 stages and attracted around 70 entrants. Every stage started in the evening, with riders riding throughout the night and arriving the following afternoon. The original Tour de France was created to promote the magazine l'Auto, with the first place rider winning 12 thousand francs. 12.000 francs was about six times the average income of a worker at that time, so this was a fortune!

Here are some beautiful vintage photographs of Le Tour participants. Explore thousands of Tour de France related items through Europeana.

Murder in Sarajevo and the First World War

Saturday, 28 June this year marked one hundred years since 19-year-old Serbian Gavrilo Princip assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, sparking controversy and anger all across Europe and eventually leading to the outbreak of war in August 1914.

So what exactly happened, how did it lead to one of the bloodiest wars in history and what kind of film footage relating to the event is available today?

Archduke Franz Ferdinand was commanded by the Emperor of Austria to go to Sarajevo to make an inspection of the Austro-Hungarian troops stationed there. The presence of Austria-Hungary in Bosnia angered the Serbian freedom fighter group, The Black Hand, who were part of a movement to seek independence of the Slavic people from Austro-Hungarian rule.

Having attempted the assassination of other Austro-Hungarian officials, seven members of the group seized this opportunity and conspired to kill the Archduke during his visit to Sarajevo.

On the morning of 28 June 1914, everything was set in place. Assassins had been prepared along the route of the procession. When the cars containing the Archduke and his wife passed the first and second assassin, both failed to act. The third assassin along the route threw a grenade at the car but it missed and exploded under the car following the Archduke, injuring about 20 people.

The driver of the Archduke’s car, realising what had happened, decided to drive away from the procession and in doing so, passed the other three assassins, but drove so quickly that they were unable to carry out their plans. It seemed as though they had missed their opportunity. Assassin Gavrilo Princip made his way out of the crowds and contemplated what to do next.

In the meantime, the Archduke decided to abandon the rest of the planned procession to visit those who had been injured in the blast earlier that day. The driver, unsure of the way to the hospital, took a wrong turn down the very road along which Princip was walking.

The young Serbian could not believe his luck when his target’s car drove straight down the road towards him. He fired two shots into the car and both the Archduke and his wife, Sofia, were killed almost instantly.

This assassination caused an uproar across Europe and set off an accelerated chain of events. Austria-Hungary blamed Serbia for the attack and sent them an ultimatum, which was supported by Austria-Hungary’s ally, Germany. While Serbia accepted most of Austria-Hungary’s demands, there were some upon which the two countries could not agree and as a result both the Austro-Hungarian and the Serbian armies mobilised for attack.

Russia, in support of Serbia, also prepared for war, while Germany refused Britain’s demand to declare support for Belgian neutrality in case of war and also began to mobilise its army.

Less than two weeks after Austria-Hungary’s ultimatum to Serbia was issued, Serbia, Russia, and its allies France, Belgium and Great Britain had declared war on Germany and Austria-Hungary, and World War I had begun.

EFG1914’s Virtual Exhibitiongives an indication of how even films covering the same events can be used to tell their own stories. The page titled ´Same images, different stories’ uses the assassination of Franz Ferdinand and his wife as examples of the way that events can be dramatised and exaggerated for a more impressive cinematic experience, with one reenactment of the event having been released as late as 1968 (Sarajevski atentat: Yugoslavia, 1968).

Other remaining newsreel footage from films such asDas Attentat auf den Thronfolger Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand am 28. Juni 1914 in Sarajevo(Austria-Hungary, 1914) highlight the paramount significance of the assassination on an international scale, and anticipate the rise of the international newsreel, which would become a dominant mode of European film in the four years to follow.

18 vintage football photographs

Football is the world’s most popular sport. Its success is in its simplicity. With just some land, goal markers and a ball, anybody can play it. This popular sport is not just a game. To many, it is the stuff of life. In some countries, football is part of the national culture: families, friendships and communities are brought together, or forced apart by it.

The first FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association) World Cup took place in Uruguay in 1930. Following a 12-year pause due to the outbreak of World War Two, the World Cup resumed in 1958 and is now held in a different country every four years. The tournament is so popular that over 37 billion people watched the France 1998 championship. One of the world’s most famous football matches however, took place between German and British troops in the No Man’s Land of the Western front during the 1915 Christmas truce of World War One. We have delved into Europeana's football-related collections for you, and highlight here a selection of historical pictures of the world's most popular sport below. Want to explore more?

How films reported the martime disaster of the Lusitania

Ninety-nine years ago, RMS Lusitania, a British ocean liner, was sunk by a German U-Boat, resulting in the deaths of 1,198 passengers and crew and eventually leading to America’s entry into World War I.

In early 1915 German submarines, or 'U-Boats', began to be used in the German maritime campaign against the British.

Initially they were used only to attack naval ships but soon began to attack merchant vessels, though usually in accordance with the Cruiser Rules which stated that 'a warship … may not sink or render incapable of navigation a merchant vessel without having first placed passengers, crew and ship's papers in a place of safety'.

However, even with these rules in place it was clear that ships which sailed in the seas around the British isles were at risk of being attacked by German submarines.

The German embassy in Washington D.C. even placed a warning advertisement in American newspapers telling passengers travelling to Great Britain that they did so at their own risk. Some passengers were concerned about this warning, but on the whole it was not considered to be a serious threat by the majority of the passengers, and survivors of the disaster have said that the threat of being attacked was taken light-heartedly and was even the subject of jokes on board the ship.

On 7 May 1915, Lusitania had almost reached its destination of Liverpool when she crossed in front of the German submarine U-20, captained by Kapitänleutnant Walther Schwieger. Schwieger gave the command to fire a torpedo which struck Lusitania on the starboard side. A second explosion occurred moments later which rocked the boat further, and caused the ship to tilt to one side. This meant that the lifeboats on one side of the boat were completely unusable, and as a result only six lifeboats were successfully launched.

Some passengers jumped overboard and clung onto rafts, while others were offered refuge when the collapsible lifeboats floated out of the sinking ship.

After only 18 minutes, the Lusitania had completely sunk.

Of the 1,961 verified passengers aboard the ship, only 764 survived, of whom 128 were American. The sinking caused an international uproar, both in Britain and in America, and this loss of neutral American citizens is widely considered to be one of the reasons that America joined the war in 1917.

There is no actual footage of the sinking of the ship but re-enactments where shot after the tragic event. Examples of these, usually propagandistic productions, can be found on the EFG1914 website, where films and other non-film material relating to World War I have been digitised and made available by 21 European film archives.

The 1918 film,The Sinking of the Lusitania, from the archives of the Cinémathèque Royale de Belgique, was made by American animator Winsor McCay in the style of a documentary. It aimed to inspire an anti-German sentiment by describing the incident as 'the most violent cruelty that was ever perpetrated upon an unsuspecting and innocent people' and as 'the crime that shocked humanity'.



The Sinking of the Lusitania, 1918. European Film Gateway

Similarly,Lest We Forget, a 1918 British film from the Imperial War Museum’s archive, stresses the fact that the ship was unarmed and refers to the Germans as Huns who must be stopped. The film also shows an excerpt which appears to be from a German newspaper and reads, 'With joyful pride we contemplate this latest deed of our navy'. Here the British are not only condemning the German navy for sinking the ship but portraying the whole nation as cruel and merciless enemies.



Lest We Forget, 1918. European Film Gateway

Interestingly, however, there is an American film in the collection from the Deutsche Kinemathek which portrays 'the German' quite differently.

InThe False Faces, released at some time between 1918-1919, one of the characters is supposed to be the captain of the German U-Boat which fired the torpedo at RMS Lusitania. He is seen to be having visions of those who perished on the ship and in the surrounding waters and seems to be driven mad with sorrow and shame for what he did.



The False Faces, 1918/1919. European Film Gateway

Even after almost a hundred years, the sinking of the Lusitania is considered a controversial international event and there are many theories surrounding it which reject the British Admiralty’s official version of events.

It is widely accepted that there were two explosions on RMS Lusitania, based on Walther Schwieger’s eyewitness account as well as countless others from survivors who managed to escape from the ship onto the lifeboats. This, coupled with the fact that the ship took a mere 18 minutes to sink, has led historians to suggest that the ship was carrying military ammunition which created an explosion, which would have meant that the ship was in violation of the Cruiser Rules and therefore that Schwieger’s decision to fire at it was legitimate.

However, even to this day the British government have still never confirmed the presence of ammunition on the ship, despite 4 million American-made bullets having been found in and around the shipwreck by divers in 2008, and instead still consider that the German U Boats violated maritime law by firing a torpedo at a passenger cruiser.

It has also been suggested that the Lusitania was sunk on purpose by the British Admiralty in order to enrage the Americans and encourage them to join the war against the Germans. Whether this was the case or not, the sinking of RMS Lusitania did act as a very effective propaganda tool against the Germans in both America and Great Britain.

Birth of an industrial icon

On May 28 1937, the German Labour Front founded Volkswagen, which is now the biggest German automaker and the second largest automaker in the world.

Volkswagen is probably best known for its iconic Beetle, officially called the Volkswagen Type 1. The car is certainly part of Europe’s design and engineering heritage, therefore you’ll find many pictures of this quirky car in Europeana.

Although designed in the 1930s, the Beetle was only produced in significant numbers from 1945 onwards (mass production had been put on hold during the Second World War) when the model was internally designated the Volkswagen Type 1, and marketed simply as the "Volkswagen".

Through time the Beetle has proved to be very popular by millions of people across Europe and beyond, and today early versions of the car can still be seen on roads all over the world, as well as many instances of its 1998 successor, the New Beetle.

Reflecting society through cartography

Adventurers love them, explorers devise them, and everyone uses them - maps.

From cave paintings to ancient maps of Babylon, Greece, and Asia, through the Age of Discovery (15th – 17th century) up until today, people have created and used maps as the essential tools to help them define, explain, and navigate their way through the world.

Many old maps are beautifully illustrated and have been transformed into exquisite works of art. These illustrated maps sometimes help with giving insights into a society or culture, certainly through content and sometimes even through artistic style.

European maps from the 13th century for example, used illustrations to show important places linked with Christian mythology and history, as well as other imaginative pictures in less important places.

During the 17th and 18th century printed maps included vignettes, cartouches, heraldry of the social elites, images of monarchs or themes from Greek mythology, religion, or religion geography as illustrations. Below we highlight some stunning maps with impressive illustrations that look like works of art.

Songs were a key part of social life

Whether they had a message or were a simple form of entertainment, songs were a key part of life in society at this the beginning of the 20th century. The songs which would be churned out for popular consumption hailed from a long tradition, stretching back to the Revolution, taking in songwriters such as Béranger and Jean-Baptiste Clément, and they came in all sorts of forms for all sorts of audiences and causes.

Very different in their themes from the traditional religious and children’s songs, the happily-ending romances were the most common on the cabaret stage. Because they were oral by nature, these popular songs were produced and widely heard in the form of very cheap small versions, of which a number took on a new stature from the end of the century by means of illustrations which sometimes bore the signature of great names and which were sold in the street or as a supplement to magazines and daily newspapers. Songs with a social or political message, also lived on, carried by the voices of singer songwriters and contained numerous examples of anticlerical, anarchist and antimilitarist feeling which ran through pre-1914 society.

One may have thought that the First World War, with all its barbarity, might have silenced the songwriters and starved the people of their "thirst for songs". Not at all. Folks would sing on their way to the front, they would sing in the rear echelons, to stoke up their courage, and despite everything else to entertain themselves. Nevertheless there was a hint, through the new and revisited themes, of the hardship that everyone was experiencing. Out of more than 300 small versions of the songs from the Great War kept at the department of Music of the BnF (French National Library), around 70% (215) came out during 1915 alone, compared to 45 in 1914 and 37 between 1916 and 1918.

During the two first years of the First World War, patriotic songs enjoyed a major resurgence, similar to that seen after the defeat of 1871. Very popular tunes or lyrics such as the Marseillaise or the revolutionary song, the Carmagnole, were often covered. (La Carmagnole du Kaiser, The Carmagnole of the Kaiser) (La française, sur air de la marseillaise, The Frenchwoman to the tune of the Marseillaise) on the label.

Songs about the defeat of 1871, and the fate of the people from Alsace-Lorraine, such as the famous romance "C’est un oiseau qui vient de France" (A bird which came from France) were adapted in 1914. Public Domain, French National Library

Alongside the national anthems of the allied powers, and the traditional "travelling songs", very many "patriotic songs" which were aimed at uniting the Nation in a tremendous surge of republicanism, bore witness to the principal military movements, in Belgium then in France; the fall of the bastions of Liège and Namur, the siege of Paris and the requisitioning of the taxis for the Marne were recounted with bellicose and vengeful enthusiasm which portrayed the enemy as something to be demonized and ridiculed.

For indeed the "krauts" were accused of being responsible for the worst atrocities throughout the war, such as raping French women and killing children:L'enfant au p'tit fusil de bois,Il est foutu Guillaume!,Gavroche dans la tranchée,Ballade impérialeandL'enfant au p'tit fusil de bois

With the war entering a stalemate from the autumn of 1914, the determination and hope for a quick end to the conflict progressively gave way to the harsh reality of the battlefields. References to the dead and wounded would start to appear in the lyrics and on the illustrated covers of the songs which immortalised their contribution to the war. Whilst at the same time, at the Panthéon the talk was of the heroes of Valmy and the Great Army, and even Jeanne d’Arc, to fill the conscripts with the stomach for battle and encourage the youngest to enlist.

Charity work to support the wounded and their families was intensified. From November 1914, with the reopening of the theatres in the rear echelons and the establishment of the army theatres, songs for entertaining started to appear, often full of propaganda or happy sentiments, as an antidote to the boredom experience by the soldiers stuck in their trenches, and as a way of providing them with a form of contact with the rear echelons.

The musicians who were called up or posted to the front such as the songwriter Théodore Botrel or the composer André Caplet, author of the famous Marche de Douaumont (March of Douaumont) would use their talent to help out the Army. The rear echelons were treated to performances of “real-life songs" which played up sentimental or comical emotions, in a popular language which was often rich in colour to the point of containing slang taken from working songs. The musical scores which were more often than not written or composed by amateur authors (60% of them would remain anonymous), would be restricted to a melody without any accompaniment, using known lyrics and tunes.

In the form of choruses and couplets based on polka or marching rhythms, they would be all about the daily life in the trenches, honouring in turn the different arms and jobs from the "poilu" (infantryman) or the “bleuet" (blue uniformed infantrymen of 1915), to the airmen, not forgetting the “chauffards" drivers, the stretcher bearers, the nurses and the health services. The rear echelons were not to be outdone with their long list of stereotypes: French women reduced once more to their traditional role of devoted mothers, sisters and wives, specialist workers called up to the rear echelons to contribute to the war effort in the "cannon and ammunitions" factories.

The bayonet, the machine gun as well as the famous 75mm field gun, which were the soldiers’ faithful companions and the pride of the French army at the start of the war, provided the rhythm to the songs with their noise whereas the love stories and other “three penny romances”, were intended to take the soldiers’ and people’s minds off the horrors of war. The illustrated covers, which were very rarely signed, sometimes set to colour (in the colours of the French flag which was itself very much in evidence) despite these difficult years, were in tune with the language used: the aesthetics just like the melody, which could be serious or for dancing, scholarly or simplistic, rousing or poignant, would fit in with the type of language in the song.

Alongside what was an "easy" repertoire, there were also lyrics with a high literary and musical content, coming from established authors, from often conservative backgrounds (Charles Péguy, for example), and from professional musicians (Claude Debussy) many of whom performed at concerts on the front line. As varied as they were, these edited songs were none the less the tools of the propaganda machine and were subject to rigorous censorship. This was how the songLes héros de Craonne, (The heroes of Craonne) which was written in 1918 as a tribute to the Paquette division which sacrificed itself on 5 May 1917, was claimed to be the reply to the famous Chanson de Craonne.

Song of Craonne itself was censured because of its subversive nature with regard to the Nation and whose anonymous author was never unmasked despite the rewards which were promised… Although peace was sometimes mentioned, it was because it was to be fought for in a just war "for freedom and the defence of humanity" in 1914, but the peace which was to be earned through a vast Fraternity movement, which implied the refusal to fight, emerged at the end of 1916: "After so much pain, the hatred Will finally give way to Fraternity! No more bloody fighting, no more pointless slaughter, So let mankind live in peace from now on! Chorus … Let the World Fight together as one So that Peace will triumph!"Find the full French song here.

Stories and testimonies from World War One

The Istituto Centrale per il Catalogo Unico delle Biblioteche Italiane e per le Informazioni Bibliografiche (ICCU) highlights some of the memories contributed by citizens at the 'Seminario formativo e raccolta di fotografie, lettere, ricordi della Grande guerra' community collection day held in Rome at the National Central Library on 5 May 2013.

Sasso di Stria: memories of the soldier Armando Montanari

Armando Montanari was born in 1894 and enlisted in the 81st Infantry Regiment. He was one of the 16 volunteers involved in the Italian offensive against the Austrian stronghold of Sasso di Stria, which occurred on 17-18 October 1915. He was wounded in the shoulder and was awarded the Medal of Valour alongside his surviving companions. The Lieutenant Commander of the patrol was Mario Fusetti who died in action and was awarded the Gold Medal.

The documents accompanying this story (shown in photographs below and in full on theEuropeana 1914-1918website) are part of one single precious album put together by Montanari himself. The album contains photographs, drawings with handwritten captions, documents and newspaper clippings dating from Montanari's imprisonment in the Austrian prison camp at Mauthausen to the news of his medal.

Among all memories included in the album, the letter that Mario Fusetti wrote the day before the action (October 16) and sent to his relatives is to be considered particularly significant. In the letter Fusetti describes the war from the beginning up until the battle with the Austrian enemy, and he asks his family to communicate his thoughts to the colonel and to his brothers-in-arms. All of the documents have been contributed by Mr. Matteo Iacobini.

Memory of the Forcella GiralbaThis story is told by Mrs. Sandra Tuzi, the wife of a soldier's nephew, whose experiences this object illustrates. The soldier, Officer Ivan Coen was born in Rovigo and enlisted in the 32nd Regiment. The story testifies to Coen's experiences on the Forcella della Giralba pass in the Dolomite mountains, where both his feet got frozen.

The object (shown in the photograph below and in full onEuropeanawebsite) was created by his soldiers. It was engraved with a nail and depicts the mountain landscape, edelweiss flowers and the inscription '32° Fotoelettrica'.

The White War on the AdamelloThese 32 photos form a ´unique´ album of images relating to the White War on the Adamello mountain in the Italian Alps (shown in photographs below and in full on theEuropeana 1914-1918website). It is a photographic record of a soldier at the front and each photo has handwritten notes on the reverse. The album includes anecdotes about the soldiers’ daily lives, pictures of weapons and battles, route plans and military strategies.

The annotations in the soldier’s own handwriting on some of the photos describe the First World War in Val Camonica, and in Edolo and Vezza d'Oglio in particular. In fact, in Edolo there were several military commands that directed operations on the front near the Adamello, the so-called 'White War'. Vezza d'Oglio, on the other hand, was the terminus of a small railway line which, starting from the station at Edolo, carried supplies and troops close to the front.

The railway climbed to the vast and difficult terrain of the Adamello frontline whose trenches and communication trenches ran from the North-West side of the mountain range over Vezza d’Oglio and reached as far as the border between Italy and Austria. Vezza d’Oglio was also a regimental command post and on several occasions ceremonies were held in the town square to award medals to the Alpine troops who had distinguished themselves in battle.

Gilgamesh and Humbaba (Chuwawa)

Biblical beasts of terror

Let’s learn a bit more about dragons from different cultures

Season 4 of Game of Thrones is back with Daenerys Targaryen, Mother of Dragons and her fire-breathing babies. Judging by the premiere episode of the season, we will probably be seeing a lot of these mythical, winged creatures. So let’s learn a bit more about dragons from different cultures.

The two most prominent cultural depictions are the European dragon and the Chinese dragon. The image of the European, winged, fire-breathing reptile developed from folk traditions that may be traced back to Greek and West Asian mythology. The formula in these tales is one monstrous beast + one heroic person who slays it.

Humbaba was a ‘fire-breathing dragon-fanged beast’ sometimes described as a dragon in the Mesopotamian poem ‘The Epic of Gilgamesh’, which is among the earliest surviving works of literature. Humbaba was the Guardian of the Cedar Forest where the gods lived, and was slayed by the hero Gilgamesh and his friend Enkidu. This clay tablet (below) in Sumerian describes the episode of the Cedar forest.

Dragons feature heavily in Christianity. Due to their serpent-like depiction in these stories, there is an allusion to Adam and the serpent. Killing the dragon was therefore symbolic of overcoming sin. Here we have Saint George who killed a dragon to save the king’s daughter.

The virgin St Margaret from Antioch (Turkey) was swallowed by Satan in the form of a dragon when she refused to renounce Christianity. But she escaped when the cross she carried irritated its belly.

Apart from the Christian association of dragons with evil, they were also seen as symbols of ferocity. Abu Mansur Sabuktigin was a 10th century ruler of Afghanistan. After his death, his two sons Mahmud and Ismail fought fiercely for the throne. The picture below shows the dust in the form of dragons to depict the ferociousness of the battle.

In the Chinese tradition, dragons are mostly depicted as snake-like with 4 legs. Unlike the Western tradition, Chinese dragons are auspicious and symbols of power, strength and good fortune for those who deserve it. So much so that there are numerous phrases and idioms in the language that refer to the beasts.

The heart of Dutch politics

The biggest painting in the Netherlands

The canal for beer

The seat of international law

The largest Mondrian collection in the world

The museum that's a work of art

The protected green space

What are the sights in The Hague that you should definitely see?

There is a famous Dutch song by Harry Jekkers, calledOh Oh Den Haag. Its chorus translates to 'Oh Oh The Hague, beautiful city, behind the dunes'. And indeed, Den Haag, as the Dutch say it (with a ‘g’ that isunpronounceable‘g’ for many foreigners) is a nice city to live and work in. And we should know - it's where the offices of Europeana Foundation are located!

The Hague is well-known as the seat of the Dutch government, and also has a long history and many beautiful museums. The city was home to writers such as Louis Couperus and Spinoza, and painters including Hendrik Willem Mesdag and Vincent van Gogh.

In this blog, we’ll give you a short introduction to The Hague, the capital city of the province of South Holland.

As of today, the Dutch Parliament convenes near the historicalBinnenhof, most of which was built in the 13th century.

This complex of buildings has been at the centre of Dutch politics for centuries. The whole city of The Hague grew up around the Binnenhof, with workers and administrators settling nearby over the centuries.

While visiting The Hague, be sure to go to thePanorama Mesdag, which gives you a view of the seaside (the town of Scheveningen to be exact) as it was in 1881.

It is the biggest painting in The Netherlands, measuring 14 metres in height and a circumference of 120 metres.

Den Haag is less known for its canals than other Dutch cities. This is a shame: there is still a canal system which allows you to see much of the inner city by boat.

The Bierkade ('beer quay') is an interesting canal – this is the place where beer was brought into the city from Delft, as beer brewing was forbidden in The Hague during the 17th century.

For those interested in architecture, theVredespaleis(The Peace Palace) is certainly worth a visit.

The building is often called the seat of international law because it houses the International Court of Justice. The building of the Peace Palace commenced in 1907, after receiving funding from Andrew Carnegie. It was officially opened in August 1913.

Another landmark building in The Hague is theKunstmuseum Den Haag.

The building was designed by the famous architect Hendrik Petrus Berlage. It was his last big work before he died in 1934. The museum has a large collection - with Dutch old masters, modern art, fashion and musical instruments. In particular, it has a large collection of paintings and drawings by Piet Mondrian, the largest in the world.

TheMauritshuisis a world-class museum in The Hague.

It is home to world-famous artworks such asThe Girl with the Pearl Earringby Johannes Vermeer and theGoldfinchby Carel Fabritius. It houses many works of art from the 17th century, known by some as the Golden Age of Dutch art, by painters such as Rembrandt, Steen and Frans Hals.

The building is a work of art in itself. It dates from the 17th century and was the residence of Count John Maurice of Nassau. It has a Dutch Classicist design, and has many symmetrical elements.

The first place many visitors to The Hague see when they enter the city is the Malieveld, a big grass-covered terrain on the edge of the Haagse Bos (the Hague forest).

In the 19th century, the area was used for horse trading. Today, it is well-known across the Netherlands as a location for festivals and demonstrations. According to a 16th century decree from the Eighty Years' War, the Malieveld cannot be built on and so remains a prominent green space in the city.

Hopefully you liked this short introduction to Den Haag. If you would like to see more of the city, don’t forget to searchEuropeana.

You'll find many historical documents, paintings and photos of the city. Oh, and if you do come, Europeana even has afree map of The Hague. Just keep in mind that it dates from 1570!

The death of an extraordinary man

Today the Berlin State Library shares the story of a map containing a bullet hole and the death of an extraordinary man.

The corners of this handcrafted map are covered with mud. And it has a hole – apparently a bullet hole. This bullet probably brought an end to the life of one of the most outstanding German writers during the First World War, Walter Flex. Flex was a war volunteer and author of the widely-read war novelWanderer zwischen beiden Welten(The Wanderer between Two Worlds), written after his best friend had been killed in the field.



The place and field names on the map reveal the location: it shows trees, swampland, lakes, villages and cottages on the Baltic island Saaremaa just off the shore of Estonia, which at that time belonged to Russia. Walter Flex and his division had landed on this island in October 1917 to attack the Russians. After three days of struggling, the Russians capitulated and delivered their weapons, but one of the soldiers refused to yield and shot Walter Flex.

The bullet tore his right forefinger off, entered his body and got stuck near the stomach. He left a last line: ’Dear parents! I dictate this postcard as I’m slightly wounded at the forefinger of my right hand. Besides this, I am well off. There’s no room for worry whatsoever. Love, Walter.’ The next day he died, at the age of just 30, from his internal injuries.



In his bag there was this map of the island Saaremaa. Today this map is part of the literary remains of Walter Flex kept in the manuscript department of the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin.

255 years ago today, the British Museum opened its doors. It was the first ever national public museum.

As a public museum, it was free to all and aimed to attract 'all studious and curious persons'. Today, it's stronger than ever, having just announcedrecord visitor figures!

Studious and curious persons study specimens at the British Museum in this George Cruickshank caricature. The guide tells the visitors that the pictures of men on the wall -Yorkshire Jim, Bristol Bill and Brummegan (Birmingham) Joe- are examples of a race of men all now extinguished!

The museum hasn't always been housed in the iconic columned building we recognise today.

To begin with, it was in a mansion called Montagu House - on the site of the existing museum. This soon became too small. For many years, during the 1800s and early 1900s, construction work was carried out to demolish the existing buildings, along with many houses surrounding them, in order to build new wings and galleries.

The result is the neo-classical British Museum as we now know it.

Did you know that Buckingham House (now Buckingham Palace) was considered as a plot for the British Museum? But it was rejected for being too expensive and in an unsuitable location!

Did you also know that the British Library - one of the world's two biggest libraries - has only been in existence since 1973? Before that, it was part of the British Museum.

Want to hear the British Museum as it is these days? Listen to thisrecording from the Great Court in 2010. It's almost like being there!

Or why not take a virtual tour through the British Museum's galleries as they were in the 19th century with this series of wood engravings?

Landscape painter and tulip dealer

Jan van Goyen, prolific artist of the Dutch Golden Age, was born on 13 January 1596. Van Goyen settled in The Hague, where he painted mostly landscapes, favouring the canals, villages and countryside of the area. He was rather prolific but his works rarely achieved high prices. To make them more cost effective to produce, he used inexpensive pigments and used them sparingly. He also added to his income by dabbling in art dealing, auctioneering and dealing in tulips and property!

Despite his creativity, he ended up in great debt. Jan was heavily influenced in his early years by his teacher, Esaias van de Velde. In turn, van Goyen's work influenced many other painters - including one of his few pupils,  Jan Steen (who incidentally married van Goyen's daughter). Whilst Van Goyen's early paintings incorporate van de Velde's traits of a high level of detail, strong colour use and crowded scenes, his later works are noted for their large skyscapes with low horizons, monochrome colours and impressive atmospheres.



Is this Jan van Goyen? The title of the drawing is 'Portrait of an unknown man', but it also bears a 'former title' of 'Portrait of Jan van Goyen'.  The description is non-committal just telling us it's a portrait of a man with a hat on!

Below is just a small selection of the nearly 500 drawings and paintings of van Goyen's that you can find on Europeana (see them all here). These ones all come from the French National Library and the Rijksmuseum.

Marco Polo's book of his travels introduced Europeans to China and Central Asia

Italian explorer Marco Polo was born on 15th September 1254 and died on the 8th or 9th January 1324. We're not sure which because in Venetian law the day ends at sunset not midnight.

It was Marco Polo's book of his travels that introduced Europeans to China and Central Asia.

Although he was not the first European to travel to China, he was the first to write about his adventures and so it was his experiences that formed the basis of early European knowledge of the country.

For example, Marco Polo brought back the idea of paper money and some think his descriptions of coal, eyeglasses and a complex postal system eventually led to their widespread use in Europe.

Marco Polo's book inspired Christopher Columbus and other explorers to begin their own adventures. You can find the book under various different titles -Book of the Marvels of the WorldorThe Travels of Marco PoloorDescription of the World(in English),Livre des merveilles du mondeorDivisament du monde(in French), andIl MilioneorOriente Poliano(in Italian).

The above illumination is an extract from the beautifully illustrated manuscript of 'Livre des merveilles du monde'(French National Library - public domain).

Did you know that Marco Polo sometimes confused the animals he encountered in Asia with mythical creatures? It's not altogether surprising,  if you knew about unicorns and then saw a rhinocerous - an impressive beast with a horn - you might confuse them too! Marco Polo claimed, among many other things, to have seen dog-headed men around the Gulf of Bengal.

Marco travelled the world (approximately 24,000 km of it!) for 24 years with his father and uncle. On returning to Venice with the riches and treasures they had gathered along the way, they found a city at war with Genoa. Marco joined the war but was captured in 1296 and put in prison. He spent his time telling his cellmate all about his travels. This friend wrote them down, along with some of his own stories.

The resulting book,The Travels of Marco Polo,soon spread across the continent. Marco was released in 1299 and became a successful merchant in Venice.

Examples of maps based on Marco Polo's travels, drawn in 1971, 1700 and 1865.

Did you know there's a species of sheep named after Marco Polo? Other things named after the explorer include: a ship - the first to sail around the world in less than 6 months; Venice airport; a frequent flyer scheme in Hong Kong; and a video game character in the 2008 gameCivilization Revolution.

Who was Saint Nicholas?

Where does the present giving tradition come from?

When do we celebrate St Nicholas?

Why do we associate St Nicholas with Christmas Eve?

Where does the red suit with its fur trimmings come from?

How the historical Saint Nicholas led to the tradition of Santa Claus

He's a man of many names - Saint Nicholas, Nikolaos of Myra, Nikolaos the Wonderworker, Nikolaos of Bari, Sinterklaas and, of course, Santa Claus.

As well as becoming the figure we associate with Christmas gift-giving, St Nicholas is also the patron saint of sailors (being known as 'Lord of the Sea' in Greece), merchants, archers, thieves, children, pawnbrokers and students in various cities and countries around Europe.

A boy called Nikolaos was born in Lycia, Greece (now part of Turkey), nearly 2,000 years ago, in March 270 to be exact. He was the only son of wealthy parents who died in an epidemic when Nikolaos was still quite young.

After this tragedy, Nikolaos went to live with his uncle, a bishop, and went on to become a priest himself, and then became Bishop of Myra.

Bishop Nikolaos was one of the bishops who signed the Nicene Creed, which is a document that forms the mainstream definition of Christianity for most Christians.

In one legend about him, Nikolaos helps three children when they are murdered by a butcher and are to be sold as ham (or meat pies depending on the legend you hear). Nikolaos's prayers resurrect the three children, saving them from their Sweeney Todd style fate. This story gives us a good idea of why St Nicholas is known as a protector of children.

His remains (relics) now lie split between Bari and Venice in Italy and perform another miracle on a regular basis. It is said that every year his relics in Bari produce a liquid that has miraculous powers. There are potential natural explanations for this, but why spoil the story of a miracle?

Nikolaos developed a rather wonderful habit of secretly giving presents to people - he did things like putting coins in people's shoes.

In one of the most famous stories about him, Nikolaos learned of a poor man with three daughters who couldn't afford a dowry for them. Nikolaos secretly helped the family by passing by the house at night and throwing a purse full of gold coins for each daughter in through the window.

This present-giving to other people's homes under the cover of darkness persists in the tradition of Santa Claus.

St Nicholas's feast day is 6 December, the date he died in the year 343 at the age of 73. Many communities still celebrate on this date.

In medieval times, nuns are said to have anonymously left baskets of food and clothing on the doorsteps of those in need each 6 December. Sailors visited Nicholas fairs on 6 December for small presents which they gave to their children on that date 'from St Nicholas', saving the larger presents for Christmas.

It seems that literature has a lot to do with it.

In 1821, America's first lithographed book,Children's Friend,contained a story about Santa Claus. It is thought to be the first to have him visit on Christmas Eve, rather than 6 December. Then came the 1823 poem 'The Night Before Christmas' or 'A Visit From St Nicholas' as it was originally known, by Clement Clark Moore.

This poem, now a yuletide favourite, saw the Saint Nicholas character also visiting and delivering presents on Christmas Eve and also turned him into a 'jolly old elf'.

There's a theory that Coca-Cola used Santa Claus in their marketing material and gave him a red coat. Well, it's not quite true.

Coca-Cola did indeed popularise the image with a series of adverts beginning in 1931. But Santa Claus had been dressed in red for a while before that.

We think that the vision of Santa in a red suit first came from the illustrator Thomas Nast who had him in red as early as 1869. For more about the origins of Santa Claus, visitThe St Nicholas Center.

We've had Hallowe'en and now the nights are growing ever longer, it's the perfect time for a spot of witchcraft, some would say.

The images from Europeana below show both fictional witches, like the three that Macbeth meets on the heath in Shakespeare's drama, and 'real' witches like Mother Shipton, a woman branded as a 'witch' because of her ability to tell the future and Mother Damnable, the 'remarkable shrew of Kentish Town'.

The selection also includes some typical associations to do with witches including cooking up potions - look out for the skulls and human bones going into the pot - as well as links with the devil, flying and broomsticks.

Félix Arturo Lope de Vega y Carpiowas born 25 November 1562 and died on 27 August 1635. He was a terrifically prolific writer and one of the best dramatists and lyric poets of the Spanish Golden Century of Baroque Literature. His plays are still being performed today. In his time, he penned some 3,000 sonnets, 3 novels, 4 novellas, 9 epic poems, and about 1,800 plays. Examples of some of his most famous plays areEl acero de Madrid(The Steel of Madrid),El perro del Hortelano(The Gardener's Dog), andLa viuda valenciana(The widow from Valencia).

'Lupus de Vega Carpio [Material gráfico]', Biblioteca Valenciana Digital and Hispana, public domain

With such a large amount of work being generated, de Vega would have to be something pretty special for them all to be great - many people thought he concentrated too much on quantity and not enough on quality. He wrote to order,  with many of his plays going from pen to stage within just 24 hours. Despite this haste, at least 80 of his plays are thought of as masterpieces. De Vega wrote his first play aged 12 and went on to study at university. He shaped Spanish theatre, establishing the three act comedia as the definitive Spanish theatrical form. In spite of his university education, he resisted the classical form of language, and instead championed the language of ordinary life saying 'Let us then speak to him in the language of fools, since it is he who pays us.'

De Vega was a pioneer. His work doesn't conform to the standard categories such as comedy and tragedy, it is more concerned with the drama of intrigue - cloak and dagger tales of love and honour amongst the nobility. For de Vega, the plot was the most important element of a play. And speaking of plot, he had plenty of inspiration from his own eventful and dramatic life, which included a stint in the navy and a love affair with an actress that ended in a stint in jail for libel and banishment from the court. If that wasn't enough excitement, de Vega went into exile, married a 16-year-old, and took part in the Spanish armada. A veritable ladies man, after his wife died in childbirth, de Vega remarried and continued to have affairs despite finding religion and joining the priesthood.

The final year of his life was a tragic one; his son died in a shipwreck and his daughter was abducted. In the same year, de Vega himself died of scarlet fever. Despite having been written 400 years ago, de Vega's plays are still being produced today. These pictures show a series of photographs from a 1955 production of The Gardener's Dog in Paris; a 1963 Hungarian set design called 'The Crafty Bride'; a theatre poster for a 1917 production by 'Teatro Lope de Vega'; and a poster for a 1958 production of The Gardener's Dog at József Attila Theatre; Budapest.

November 21 is World Philosophy Day* so we're taking a quick look at what philosophy is all about and introducing you to some of the great philosophers.

Getting to grips with exactly what 'philosophy' means is about as tricky as some of the questions the discipline itself tries to answer. Philosophy, literally meaning 'the love of wisdom', is all about knowledge, learning and scholarship.

Everyone who has achieved a PhD is officially a Doctor of Philosophy, but that doesn't necessarily make them philosophers according to the common use of the word. The Oxford English Dictionary's etymology of the word 'philosophy' includes the 'love of truth and virtuous living', 'the study of the fundamental nature of knowledge, reality, and existence, and the basics and limits of human understanding' as well as 'natural science' and 'alchemy'.

Philosophers are thinkers, intellectual fact-finders and theorists.

They try to answer some of the fundamental questions about human existence, questions such as 'Who am I?', 'Why am I here?', 'Do humans really have free will?', 'Does God exist?', 'Is what I see and experience real?' 'I think therefore I am', is a philosophical conclusion from René Descartes, who in order to work out what he really, really did know for sure, started by doubting everything. He knew that he definitely could and did think (what he thought about being irrelevant), and so concluded that if he could think, he must exist. The concepts philosophy deals with are as old as the human race and the discipline of exploring them has given rise to science and logic with their many varied branches, including metaphysics and computing.

Speaking of branches, one philosophical question I'm sure you'll all have debated at length was set by Bishop George Berkeley in 1710 - if a tree falls in a forest and no-one is there to hear it, does it make a sound? This isn't a trick question, it's all about unobserved reality - how can we be absolutely sure that something exists if we cannot perceive it ourselves?

If you'd like more philosophical riddles,check out this blog, which poses and discusses the questions: Should we kill healthy people for their organs? Are you the same person who started reading this article? Is that really a computer screen in front of you? Did you really choose to read this article? Does your head hurt yet? If it does, try this slightly less intensive brain workout.

Here are a dozen great philosophers that you can find in Europeana. How many can you name? Answers below!

From top to bottom, left to right, these great philosophers are:Aristotle,Confucius,Descartes,David Hume,Immanuel Kant,St Thomas Aquinas,John Locke,Avicenna,Plato,Socrates,Epicurus,Zeno of Elea. *World Philosophy Dayis celebrated every third Thursday of November.

History and symbolism in Rīga landmark sculpture

People have always honoured their heroes - those who have wrought majestic accomplishments and been involved in great historical events - by building monuments to them. Monumental stones and words of gravitas ensure that powerful thoughts and uplifting accomplishments are passed from generation to generation.

In Latvia, the declaration of freedom and unity for the people is celebrated annually on Independence Day, 18 November. In 1935, the celebration included the unveiling of the Freedom Monument. Its sculptural and structural appearance captures the idea of freedom.

The Freedom Monument rises above the Riga rooftops at the very heart of the capital of Latvia.

The idea of building a monument dedicated to battles for freedom arose in 1922 when the then Prime Minister Zigfrīds Anna Meierovics began preparing for a memorial column. After various competitions, Latvian sculptor Kārlis Zāle was chosen for this work with a project named 'Mirdzi kā zvaigzne!' (Bright as a star!). The construction works started on November 18, 1931, thanks to people's donations.

The monument was established on November 18, 1935, on the 17th anniversary of The Republic of Latvia. The monument carries the words proposed by Kārlis Skalbe – 'Tēvzemei un Brīvībai' (For Fatherland and Freedom).

The main sculpture on the Freedom Monument depicts a Latvian woman, hewn from copper. She lifts three gilded stars symbolising the unity of the three historical regions of Latvia: Kurzeme, Vidzeme and Latgale.

13 sculptures and bas-reliefs on the monument depict the history of Latvia – from the invasion of crusaders to the revival of Latvian national self-confidence in the 19th century andbattles for freedom.

56 sculptures are arranged in 13 groups on four levels. The base level of the monument symbolises the nation's work ethic, spiritual strength, and striving for independence. The front of the monument features two travertine reliefs - 'Latvian Riflemen' and 'Latvian People: the Singers'.

Other groups depict Latvian basic values: Work, Guards of the Fatherland, Mother — Family Guard, and Scholars. On the sides, the travertine panels bear reference to the Russian Revolution of 1905 and Latvian War of Independence.

The middle block symbolises the nation's ideals and striving for freedom: 'Latvia' is ready to defend the Motherland, 'Chain Breakers' try to break free from their chains, 'Lāčplēsis' (an epic Latvian folk hero) encourages the fight against evil powers, while 'Vaidelotis' (a Baltic pagan priest) symbolises spiritual strength.

During the Soviet occupation, any gathering at the Freedom Monument was strictly forbidden. Despite this, for Latvian people it was still a symbol of independence.

In 1987, around 5,000 people took part in protests organised by 'Helsinki-86' - a movement against the Soviet regime. People lay flowers by the Freedom Monument honouring the victims of mass deportations. The monument once again became the centre of political activity and regained its pre-war legacy.

After Latvia regained its independence in 1991, the guard of honour was resumed at the monument.

Restoration work was conducted in 1980-1981, 2001, 2013, and 2017. In 2020, a law was passed to ensuring regular, planned preservation of the monument. The importance of the Freedom Monument has not been lost over the decades and will not be lost in the future.

Since 2024, a downloadable 3D model of the monument has been made available on Europeana.eu, meaning you can explore the artistic details and symbols of the monument up close.

It is thought that of 3,400 years of written history, there have only been 250 years in which no country has been documented as being at war. I'm sure that most of us would class ourselves as advocates of peace, but some people go much further, making it their life's work to try to put an end to war and make peace a reality.

Here is a glimpse of some of the high profile peace activists you can find on Europeana.

First up, Mahatma Gandhi. Through non-violent disobedience, Gandhi led India to independence and inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. Gandhi's vision was of an India where people of different religions lived harmoniously side by side. To promote this idea, he undertook fasts and visited areas troubled by religious unrest. Gandhi was assassinated in January 1948 by a Hindu nationalist.

Secondly, Martin Luther King, another promoter of harmony sadly killed by an objector. Like Gandhi, Luther King used non-violent protest to further his cause - the African-American civil rights movement. In 1963, he helped to organise a march on Washington, at which he delivered his famous 'I have a dream' speech. In 1964, he received the Nobel Peace Prize. He was assassinated in 1968.See Martin Luther King on Europeana

Another Nobel Peace Prize winner was Jimmy Carter, the 39th President of the United States, who received the award in 2002. Carter started his career as a peanut farmer. In 1982, he established The Carter Center in Atlanta to advance human rights and alleviate human suffering. The non-profit, nongovernmental Center promotes democracy, mediates and prevents conflicts, and monitors the electoral process in support of free and fair elections. It was for this work that Carter received the prestigous Peace Prize.See Jimmy Carter on Europeana

Finally, someone you might not know... Baroness Bertha von Suttner. It was von Suttner's influence on her friend Alfred Nobel that led to the establishment of the Nobel Peace Prize itself. Her 1889 book 'Lay Down Your Arms!' secured her position at the forefront of the peace movement and she went on to edit an international pacifist journal of the same name. In 1891, she founded an Austrian pacifist organisation and in 1905, she became the first woman to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.See Bertha von Suttner on Europeana

This week isInternational Week of Science and Peaceand so we've prepared two blogs for you - today's is about 'science' and tomorrow's is about 'peace'.

'Science' is a broad term that covers many things, including the development of new ideas, tools and equipments - inventions. So we've searched Europeana for some of the best inventions in human history.

So, do you think these are the greatest inventions since (or before) sliced bread? Let us know what you think! Find facts about each invention below the gallery...

This tool to help farmers turn their soil and sow seeds is probably as old as agriculture itself. Farmers first used sticks and hoes, which developed into larger tools that could be pulled along by animals.

The modern car was invented in 1886 by Carl Benz. The first widely affordable car was the Model T Ford, which became available in 1908. You might have heard the story that Henry Ford said  'Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black', but in fact he said this in 1918, and when the car first came out it was available in grey, green, blue, and red... not black!

There is evidence of wheeled vehicles as long ago as the 4th century BC. The wheel is commonly thought of as the fundamental human invention - something so simple and yet so life-changing. And it has become part of a phrase about what not to do when inventing or creating -make sure you don't waste your time re-inventing the wheel!

From telegraphs to the telephone and radio, science has changed the way we communicate. Samuel Morse invented the electric telegraph in 1836.

Now, we receive dozens of communications a day through our telephones (mobiles and landlines), emails and TV and radio. Most of us would feel lost without these connections to the big bad world - crazy to think that less than 200 years ago, handwritten letters and face-to-face conversations were the only options available.

Mechanical computing devices have been in existence since the 1880s but electronic computers were invented in the 20th century.  Whilst the first computers filled entire rooms, now many of us carry a super-powerful version in our pockets in the form of a smartphone.

Steam engines have been a great source of mechanical power since the late 1700s, using the pressure created by heating water into steam to create motion. The first prototype steam locomotive was built in Scotland in 1784. Steam engines were central to the Industrial Revolution.

The internet began life as a military network in the 1960s. Since the mid-1990s, with the introduction of email and the world wide web, it's fair to say that the internet has taken over the world.

Thomas Edison is widely known as the inventor of the lightbulb, but several others came up with the idea first. Edison's in 1878 was just the best.

The idea for refrigeration dates back over 200 years and the kitchen must-have has transformed our domestic lives as well as food safety and medical advancements.

It's not just our milk and frozen chips that are preserved - what about all the blood transfusions and transplant organs that can now be safely transported thanks to refrigeration?

Movable print technology comes from China in the 11th century. In the West, the invention of movable type mechanical printing technology is credited to the German printer Johannes Gutenberg in 1450. The printing press allowed large numbers of texts to be reproduced quickly and cheaply, spreading news, literature and current thinking around the globe much more easily than had ever been possible before.

And if you still think sliced bread is the best of all inventions - a little fact for you - sliced bread was first sold in 1928, advertised as 'the greatest forward step in the baking industry since bread was wrapped'. This led to the popular phrase, 'the greatest thing since sliced bread'.

--------------------------------------------------

At the Europeana 1914-1918 family history roadshow in Bucharest, Romania, we met one family historian, Alin Dimancescu, who has been building up an online archive of his family's story.

We are delighted to say that he decided to share some of that story with Europeana.



This image shows a red cross banderol imprinted with stamps from a Bucharest Hospital and the Romanian Scouts Association, dating from 1916.

Alin Dimancescu's grandfather, Ioan Dimancescu, is one of the unknown heroes who made modern Romania. Aged 15, together with his elder brother Dimitrie, he set up the first scout patrol in Romania (August 1913). Romania entered World War I in August 1916. Ioan participated in various scout missions, including transporting and treating wounded soldiers.

When the Royal Court, government and all the troops retreated to Moldavia, Ioan left his home and volunteered as a student at the infantry officer’s school. After a very intense training course he graduated in March 1917 and quickly became a second lieutenant.

In August 1917, rejoining his brother Dimitrie, Ioan took part in a very bloody and violent series of battles.

Of the 135 soldiers in his company, 121 were seriously injured or died, the remaining 14 were slightly wounded. On 24 March 1919, Ioan was awarded with the British War Medal by King Ferdinand I of Romania.

Ioan Dimancescu and his brother - Dimitrie, 1919

Because he has never met his grandfather (who died in 1951), Alin has always been intrigued by his father's stories of him and continued to study the family archive, consulting various sources. Gradually, he started to feel responsible not only for his family stories, but also for other World War I episodes and lesser known heroes.

And now Alin continues to engage with that period from the position of a Romanian Scouting enthusiast and biographer. The items that Alin has shared with us relate to medical boy scouts in World War I and include an audio recording of Constantin Sapatino, talking in 1993 about his time as a Romanian scout in 1916-1918.

Alin describes Sapatino as a war hero. At just 13 years old, he was a volunteer ambulance driver, having replaced the driver who died from typhus.

In the recording, Sapatino says, 'My first contact with the horrors of the war was when a zeppelin dropped a bomb on Covaci Street, leaving many dead and wounded. As a boy scout, I helped carry the wounded and we stayed at their disposal the whole time they were hospitalised.'

The war was difficult for Romania as its armies were engaged on two fronts - the Germans attacked from Transylvania in the north, whilst the south was under attach from both German and Bulgarian forces.

The Sapatino family fled to Moldavia. Constantin was assigned to Harlau hospital (in Iasi county) which was full of Romanian soldiers. Constantin assisted where he could but it was horrible, he says. He assisted in amputations and, to counter lice infestations, he covered his arms, legs and wrists in cotton wool soaked in camphor oil. When the ambulance driver died, Constantin volunteered to take over and was given the chance, despite his young age.

He was grateful to be away from the hospital and had different problems to deal with, such as sharing the same roads with horse carts - farm horses weren't used to see ambulances, or 'iron monsters' as Constantin called them.

Explore all of Alin's contributions to Europeana 1914-1918

Congratulations to Alin who is, we hope, an inspiration to budding family historians all across Europe. He has just signed a publishing contract for some of the stories of his 84-year-old father's memories of the 1930s and 1940s. You can read more of his family history on the following blogs: The Story of a Boy Scout (the biography of Alin’s grandfather – Ioan Dimancescu):

Gavrilo Princip: on Himself:

Гаврило Принцип о себи

The memory of World War I, its events and consequences, its victims and victors, remains very much alive today. It has become part of the individual and collective memory of Europe and of countries across the world – the stories of soldiers and their families continue to be told and published from generation to generation.

To mark the centenary of its outbreak in 2014, a consortium of national libraries and other partners from eight European countries that found themselves on different sides of the historic conflict will make an unparalleled collection of more than 400,000 digitised items relating to World War I freely available to the public for the first time through the Europeana online portal.

As part of theEuropeana 1914-1918 project, the consortium members will be adding a new blog post every month that looks at some of the stories behind just a few of these 400,000 images.

This month, our colleagues at the National Library of Serbia have uncovered an incredible record of what happened to Gavrilo Princip, who was part of the group who took part in the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria on 28 June 1914, which began the chain of events that led to the outbreak of World War I.

The notes we present in this blog show lesser known details of Gavrilo Princip’s life.

After the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo, Gavrilo Princip was put on trial with the other assassins. He was sentenced on 28 October 1914 to twenty years in prison, and was transferred to the military prison in Terezin on 2December 1914.

Here, he was visited several times by Dr Martin Pappenheim. Pappenheim recorded his talks with Princip, which give new perspectives on our understanding of his personality.





Princip's fingerprints

These short, stilted notes were made in the period between February and June 1916, and cover Princip’s life story, the assassination, and his political and social ideals.

They were translated from the original German by Dragan Purešić.

Princip Gavrilo, 19 February 1916, Prison. From 5 December 1914, held here. Held in solitary confinement all of the time. Three days ago, his shackles were removed. Father is a peasant, and is also in business. Father is a calm man, doesn’t drink; lives in Grahovo, Bosnia. No illness in the family. Princip did five grades of school in Sarajevo, then three grades in Belgrade, but did not sit the final examination. Was always healthy. Had no serious injuries until assassination. No bedwetting. At school he walked in his sleep. Only lasted for one year. Never lost consciousness. Always an excellent pupil up to fifth grade. Fell in love. Began to understand ideals, etc. Left school in Sarajevo in 1911. Then took part in nationalist demonstrations against [Prime Minister of Hungary] Tisza. Was among pupils at the front of the demonstrations. Was treated badly by his professors. Began to read a lot of anarchist, socialist, and nationalist pamphlets, as well as fiction Bought books himself; didn’t talk of these things: his Father was not interested in political matters. He was seldom with other pupils, and was always alone. Always a still, sentimental, serious child. As a child, not especially religious. The year 1911 was critical. He went to Belgrade alone, telling no one. Father and brother refused to send money; it was agreed he should stay in Belgrade. Father is 54, Mother is 45. He has two brothers: one 26, one 18. Six more died as children before the age of 10. He is the fourth child. Brothers are a school pupil and a merchant. Brothers are quite ordinary men. His love for the girl remained, yet he never wrote to her. Said he met her in fourth grade; never kissed his love; and talked of it no more. Studied as private pupil. Had no friends; alone, always in libraries. He wanted to go to fight in the Balkan War, but considered too weak. Spent several months each year at his brother’s house near Sarajevo. Passed eighth grade examination, but only in May 1914. After the assassination, he had injuries on his head and back. He took potassium cyanide, but was weak, and vomited. In solitary confinement: conditions are very bad. He is without books, has nothing to read, and allowed no communication. He is used to constant reading, and misses it most in prison. Sleeps at night for four hours at most. Dreams a lot. Says he has beautiful dreams of life, of love: says nothing horrible. He thinks about everything, especially of the circumstances in his Fatherland. He has heard something about the War. He has heard ‘a tragic thing’, that Serbia is no more. His life is hard, Serbia is no more, says his people will have a rough time. Says that World War was inevitable, and didn’t depend on that [assassination]. He was an idealistic man, and wanted to avenge his people. His motives were revenge and love. All of his youth he was in a revolutionary mood. Talks of the anarchist pamphlets that led him to assassination. He thinks differently today; he thinks social revolution is possible throughout Europe, that things change. He doesn’t want to talk about it in front of the warden. He is not ill-treated- everyone behaves correctly. A month ago admitted to trying to commit suicide, he wanted to hang himself with a towel. It was stupid to have hope. He has a wound on the chest and arm. Says that ‘a life like mine is impossible’.  Around noon, he could not eat, was in a bad mood, and suddenly had the idea to hang himself. Says he would do it, if he had a chance. He thinks of his parents and family- but hears nothing about them. Misses them dearly.

Белешке које представљамо приказују мање познате детаље о животу Гаврила Принципа. Настале су у време када је Велики рат беснео свом жестином. Папенхајм је забележио разговоре које је водио са Принципом, чиме је дата нова перспектива у поимању његове личности.   Након атентата на надвојводу Франца Фердинанда, Гаврилу Принципу је суђено у Сарајеву заједно са осталим атентаторима и, осуђен 28. Х 1914. године, пребачен је 2. ХII 1914. године у војни затвор у Терезину, где га неколико пута посећује доктор Мартин Папенхајм. Гаврило Принцип умире од туберкулозе 28. IV 1918. године. Стенографске биљешке доцента дра. Мартина Папенхајма о чешћим разговорима са Гаврилом Принципом у времену од фебруара до јуна 1916. : О хисторији његовог живота, о атентату и о његовим политичким и социјалним идејама.

_Принцип Гаврило 19. II 1916. – Казнени завод **            O**д 5. XII 1914. овдје. Читаво вријеме сам у ћелији. Прије три дана скинути окови. Отац сељак, бави се и подузећима. Отац миран човјек, не пије. Отац живи у Грахову, у Босни. Нема болести у фамилији. Пет разреда школе (свршио) у Сарајеву, затим три разреда у Београду, без матуре. Увијек био здрав. Не зна ништа о тешким повредама до атентата. Тада повреде на глави и свуда, онда пао у несвијест. Шарлах. Није имао Enuresis nocturna. Као гимназиста ноћу тумарао. У соби се шетао. Само за једне године. Пробудих се. У трећем разреду. Никада нисам имао нападе несвјестице. Увијек одличан ђак до петога разреда. Заљубих се. Почео је да схвата идеале, итд. Напустио школу у Сарајеву 1911. Онда су биле националистичке демонстрације против Тисе. Био је у првом реду ученика. Професори се рђаво понашали према њему.Читао многе анархистичке, социјалистичке и националистичке списе, белетристику и све. Сам књиге куповао; о овим стварима није говорио. Оца није забављао политичким стварима. Ријеткоје био са другим ученицима; увијек сам. Био је увијек миран, сентиментално дијете. Увијек озбилјан, с књигама, са сликама, итд. Ни као дијете није био нарочито побожан. Означује годину 1911. као критичну. Сам је пошао у Београд, ником није о том говорио, отац и брат нису хтели да мушаљу новаца. Обећао је да ће бити добар ученик. Тада су се сагласили да остане у Београду. Отац 54 године, мајка 45. Још два брата. Један од 26, а други од 18 година. Још шестеро умрло, као мала дјеца до десет година, он је четврто дијете. Браћа су ученик реалке и трговац. Браћа посве обични људи.   Љубав према дјевојци није ишчезла, али јој никада није писао. Прича се да ју је упознао у четвртом разреду; идеална љубав. Није је ни пољубио; осим тога неће ништа више о томе да каже. Студираше као приватни ђак. Ни с ким се није дружио, усамљен, увијек у библиотекама. Хтио је у Балкански рат, али су пронашли да је слаб. По неколико мјесеци сваке године био је код брата код Сарајева.   Тек у мају 1914. положио испит осмога разреда. Приликом атентата озледе на глави, леђима и свуда. Узео је цианкалиј, али је био слаб па је повратио.   У самици врло рђаво, без књига, ништа нема да чита, ни с ким се није дружио. Навикао је да увијек чита. Највише пати због тога што нема нешто да чита. Највише пати због тога што нема нешто да чита. Спава ноћу највише по четири сата. Увијек санја. Лијепи снови. О животу, о лјубави, ништа што би застрашивало. Мисли о свему, нарочито о приликама у Отаџбини.   О рату је нешто чуо. Једну трагичну ствар је чуо : Србија више не постоји. Његов је живот уопште тежак, Србија не постоји, са мојим народом бит ће рђаво. Није се могао избјећи свјетски рат, од тога он није зависио (мисли на атентат пр. прев.) Био је идеалан човјек. Хтио је да освети свој народ. Мотиви: освета и љубав. Цијелу младост у таквом револуционарном расположењу. Говори о анархистичким списима који су га побуђивали на атентат.   Данас мисли другачије. Мисли да је у читавој Европи могућа социјална револуција, пошто се ствари измјењују. Неће више да о томе говори пред профусом ( старешина казнионе, пр. прев.) . Не поступа се сњиме рђаво. Сви су с њим коректни. Признаје да је прије мјесец дана покушао самоубијство, хтио се објесити о пешкир. Живот је тежак. Нема наде.Била би лудост да се нада. Има рану на прсима и на мишици. (fungus). Живот као што је мој јесте немогућ.   Тада око дванаест сати не могаше да једе, био је рђаво расположен, наједанпут идеја да се објеси. Да је имао прилику, то би учинио. Мисли на родитеље и на све, ништа не чује за њих, признаје да чезне. То (чежња, пр. прев.) постоји код свакога.

You wouldn’t be alone if you thought plastic surgery was a phenomenon of recent times. To prove it’s not, we’ve dug out these fascinating images from Europeana to highlight the long history of cosmetic surgery.

Reconstructive surgery techniques were being carried out in India by 800 BC. Sushruta, the father of surgery, made important contributions to the field of plastic and cataract surgery in the 6th century BC. The ancient Egyptians and Romans also performed cosmetic surgery.

The first American plastic surgeon was John Peter Mettauer, who, in 1827, performed the first cleft palate operation with instruments that he designed himself.

In 1845,Johann Friedrich Dieffenbachwrote a comprehensive text on rhinoplasty (nose jobs), entitledOperative Chirurgie, and introduced the concept of reoperation to improve the cosmetic appearance of the reconstructed nose.

These pictures aren't just photos of people pulling funny faces, they are the result of an experiment by one of the Fathers of Neuroscience:Guillaume-Benjamin-Amand Duchenne.

Influenced by the fashionable beliefs of physiognomy in the 19th century, Duchenne wanted to determine how the muscles in the human face produce facial expressions.

He believed a person's facial expressions were linked to their very soul. Duchenne is particularly known for the way he triggered muscular contractions with electrical probes, recording the resulting distorted and often grotesque expressions with the recently invented camera.

He published his findings in 1862, together with extraordinary photographs of the induced expressions, in the bookThe Mechanism of Human Physiognomy.

This guest blog was written by Sophie Naumann, an intern at the German National Library.

I was born close to the city of Zwickau in a small village in Saxony where my father was the local priest.

Although the Berlin Wall came down just three years before I was born, this event seems very distant to me today. The very notion of growing up in a divided Germany now seems almost absurd to me. Many young adults of my generation find it difficult to understand what reunification actually meant for the people who had lived in some cases for decades in a divided Germany.

To get a clearer idea of what the fall of the Berlin Wall meant for my family, I asked my father to tell me what he remembers.



For young people today, this is what they know of the Berlin Wall - something that has been taken down, a pile of scrap concrete.

They don't remember this...



When the Wall came down, it was a surprise to my father too. Beforehand, he'd been talking to my uncle who'd invited him and his family to join him in the West, but my father replied: 'If every doctor and priest leaves the country, what will happen then? Who will be able to give the people hope?'

And so they stayed.

He believed that the Berlin Wall would soon fall anyway - at the latest by 1995 when the Warsaw Pact was set to celebrate its 50th anniversary. But before that could happen, the Two Plus Four talks were held in 1990 which eventually led to freedom.

Many East Germans crossed the Austrian border into the Federal Republic, simply abandoning their Trabant cars at the border. My father could tell me plenty more about this time because in September 1989 he drove a caravan with a friend down to the Greek border. In the Czech Republic, they followed the trucks and trailers of the German Red Cross down to Lake Balaton where they were searching for fellow Germans in the camps who were waiting to travel to the West.

When the Wall did actually come down, my father was at home watching TV.

On 9 November 1989, he was watching the news bulletin in which it was reported that the border was to be opened. He said, 'I sat down on the floor right in front of the television and cried my eyes out in joy at the opening of the Wall because I knew what the falling of the Iron Curtain meant for us and our freedom.'

He has no more detailed memories of this time and I, his daughter, was yet to be born. But for the next generation, including myself, the fall of the Berlin Wall brought with it an incredible increase in freedom and independence.

His lasting memory now is of how hard it was to take everything in. About six months later, he told me, he was on the Ku'damm in West Berlin where, standing in the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gedächtniskirche, he felt the need to scratch his knuckles against the wall of the church until he was in pain and bleeding - so that he could really feel it for himself.

'The border's gone - you really are on the other side. We're free for now and the foreseeable future, and Europe is a free alliance of peoples, and not one based on ideology. I'm a committed European. And I have cosmopolitan attitudes and beliefs. And if it ever proves necessary to defend this freedom and to fight for it, then I will.'

The fact that my father remembers this moment so clearly after nearly a quarter of a century shows just how significant this peaceful revolution was both for the people who lived through it and for the history books.



Deutsche Nationalbibliothek, Annett Koschnick

Europeana has set up acrowdsourcing campaign, Europeana 1989,to mark the upcoming 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the preceding protest movement in Eastern Europe. Special event days are also being organised by the German National Library in Leipzig to mark the occasion. People will have the opportunity to upload their personal stories and memories of the fall of the Berlin Wall in the form of photos, videos, sound recordings, letters or other things to Europeana to help create an international archive on the Peaceful Revolution.

By the time these special event days take place I will already have completed my one-year voluntary service at the German National Library and my successor will already have taken my place.

But my father's recollections, written down here, won't be lost. The preservation of history and memories is not dependent upon whether the people who experienced the events are still alive or not, but on whether their experiences have been documented.

Dumitru Nistor, a peasant from the village of Nasaud, was born in 1893

Dumitru Nistor, a peasant from the village of Nasaud, was born in 1893.

His childhood dream was to travel and see foreign countries, so in 1912, when the time for recruiting came, he asked to be enlisted in the Austro-Hungarian navy, not the Transylvanian militia, where Romanians usually ended up.

After graduating from his Navy studies, and a trip to Vienna, he embarked as Geschützvormeister ('first cannon pointer') on the ship SMS Kaiserin Elisabeth, destined for Asia. World War I found the SMS Kaiserin Elisabeth battleship in the China Sea, where it took part in several naval battles.

On 2 November 1914, the decision was made to sink the ship. The crew also lost the land battle and Dumitru was made a prisoner by the Japanese and taken to Japan.

For the next ten months, the peasant-seaman from Nasaud remained a prisoner in a Buddhist monastery in Himeji, and was then moved to a prisoner of war camp specially built for German and Austrian prisoners at Aonogahara, not far from Kobe, where he remained until the end of 1919.

To appease his longing for his homeland, Dumitru Nistor began writing during his imprisonment:

'…seeing that I have so much time, I decided I shouldn’t let it go unused. That would have been a horrible shame; (…) That’s why I always kept myself busy with something: writing, reading, drawing, painting, learning new languages etc. I then attempted to unload the weight and pain which tormented me and burdened my heart: but with whom? And to who? (…) Not having anyone to share my pain and ideas with, I thought it good to share them with the paper: it endures, it gives the right and allows everyone.'



Dumitru Nistor's diary, Europeana 1914-1918, CC BY SA

He kept a diary entitledMy diary – Dumitru Nistor’s navy service, written by himself as a war prisoner in Aonochara – Japan 1918 and compiled two poetry volumes of poems composed by himself and gathered from his army brethren.

He describes them as 'international songs. Specifically Romanian, Italian, Serbian, Croatian, Slavonic, Bohemian, German and Hungarian songs, as I really loved singing, since I was always a happy person.'

The titles of the volumes areThe longing and misery chased awayandYouth is life’s flower. Exquisitely beautiful, with charming unique and exotic ink and watercolour drawings, Dumitru Nistor’s volumes are valuable historical documents.

In the chapterThe European war, or rather, the Universal war, Dumitru recalls in detail, day by day and hour by hour, the battles fought by the SMS Kaiserin Elisabeth’s crew to defend the German colony of Kiaotcheao.

As an ally of Great Britain, Japan addressed an ultimatum to Germany on 15 August 1914 which went unanswered. As such, on 23 August, Emperor Yoshihito declared war on Germany. On 27 August 1914, a Japanese squadron blocked the port of Tsingtao, and the SMS Kaiserin Elisabeth, despite being an Austro-Hungarian ship, joined the naval battles (after several stutters) as an ally of Germany. Right from the start, the battle appeared hopeless. On 2 November, the decision was made to sink the ship, so as not to let it fall into enemy hands, and the crew disembarked with the battles continuing on land until 6 November.

This is how Dumitru Nistor tells the story of the surrender to the Japanese:

'As the Germans realised that any resistance from our side would be futile, they raised the white flag and surrendered, and us Austrians with them, at exactly 6.30 in the morning. As such, Tsingtau fell to the Japanese on Saturday, November 7th, at 6.30. After surrendering, we laid down our weapons in “Motke Kaserne”, at 7 in the morning. The Japanese minded us and kept us in the barracks’ yard until the evening, without giving us anything to eat. Around us there were now guards with bayonets on their rifles, like traders next to purchased cattle. At night they let us in the barracks to sleep. We slept like logs, as we were so tired after so many sleepless nights. The next day, on November 8th, we woke up at 6 and washed our faces, a very good feeling, as it had been a week since we last did this. After washing, we donned clean clothes. At about 6 in the evening, they took us Austrians to the “Governament Schülle”, where we slept that night. The next day, on Monday, November 9th, we went with the Japanese to the battlefield and gathered up the dead. We were now talking to each other like friends, we were giving each other cigarettes, only the poor dead lied there motionless, they were all crushed by grenades and pierced by bayonets, some had their skulls bashed in and their guts out, with no arms or legs, God forbid, it was horrible to touch them, but what else could we do? We couldn’t leave them there as loot, they were not dogs, they had been our brothers and comrades. In the afternoon we organised a funeral for them with parades, a German priest held a beautiful service, we all shed tears, and then we buried them, we shot three volleys, and the music ended the ceremony. The siege (Belagerung) around Tsingtau had lasted for 41 days, a shameful fact for the Japanese who lingered so much around this small town. They came upon it with 60,000 soldiers, the entire garrison of Himeji, and another 5-6,000 Englishmen, while we poor saps were in Tsingtau about 5,000, cats included. We were 318 Austrians, while the others were Germans.'

Dumitru Nistor returned home in 1920, and lived until the 1960s.

He continued his work as an amateur artist. He compiled a total of 26 manuscript notebooks, but the first three, acquired in 1994 by the 'Octavian Goga' Cluj County Library, are the most valuable.

Vintage photography of the iconic Paris landmark

Everywhere needs a bit of a spruce up now and then. At home, that means getting the vacuum out or going outside with a tin of paint and a ladder.

Imagine the task though, if the building you're trying to give a face-lift is the Eiffel Tower in Paris. The Tower is made of over 18,000 individual parts, joined by 2.5 million rivets - that would take a lot of painting!

The pictures below are all from the National Library of France (Bibliothèque nationale de France). They show men at work painting the Tower in 1910, 1924 and 1932.

The first image, from 1924, seems like a European equivalent to thaticonic black and white photographof New York workmen taking a rest on the girder of an emerging skyscraper.

It took just over two years to build the Eiffel Tower. It was opened on 31 March 1889 as part of the Paris World Fair, named after Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the Tower. The Tower was supposed to be a temporary fixture on the Paris horizon - it was due to come down in 1909 but was allowed to remain.

It is 324 metres tall. More than 7 million people climb the Tower every year, ascending the 600 or so steps to its second floor, then taking a lift to the top.

Not everyone loved the design of the Eiffel Tower, thinking it useless and monstrous. Guy de Maupassant is said to have dined in the Tower's restaurant every day as it was the one place from which he couldn't see the Tower itself!

Enjoy these vintage photographs of the Eiffel Tower!

And finally, what better way to explore the Eiffel Tower than by bike?

Guiseppe Verdi was one of the world's greatest ever composers

Guiseppe Verdi(born 200 years ago today - 10 October 1813) was one of the world's greatest ever composers. His 25 operas, such as Aida and La Traviata, are famed the world over and his works are thought to be the most performed of any composer.



'Giuseppe Verdi', French National Library and The European Library, public domain

But Verdi's greatness didn't come without heartbreak. His early progress was blighted by tragedy - he married aged 22 and within just four years had lost two children and his wife. Understandably devastated, it took Verdi some time to really put his heart and soul back into composing.

In 1842-43, Verdi produced two new operas (NabuccoandI Lombardi alla Prima Crociata) which were great successes. Throughout the next four decades, his career went from strength to strength. He became well known in the Italian opera world, and later in politics too. Musically, he is known for his ability to create melodies and for his use of theatrical effect.

Despite the Italian name we know, Verdi's official registered name was Joseph Fortunin François Verdi. He was born near Busseto, which was then a part of the First French Empire.

After the unification of Italy in 1861, many of Verdi's operas were re-interpreted as having hidden revolutionary messages, and his name was used in a political slogan - Viva VERDI, in which 'VERDI' stood for 'Viva Vittorio Emanuele Re D'Italia - Long Live Victor Emmanuel King of Italy', which referred to Victor Emmanuel II, the then king of Sardinia.

What was Edgar Degas' art training?

Why did Degas not like being called an Impressionist?

What other art forms did Edgar Degas do?

Why did one of the founders of Impressionism not like being called an Impressionist?

French artist Edgar Degas is  was one of the founders of the Impressionism movement. Degas was born in Paris in 1834. Many of his paintings are observations of contemporary life in Paris in the late 19th century - he is today perhaps best known for his depictions of dancers.

Edgar Degas began painting from a young age. By the age of 18, he had turned a room in his house into a studio.

He met and revered fellow artistJean Auguste Dominique Ingres, who gave him this advice: 'Draw lines, young man, and still more lines, both from life and from memory, and you will become a good artist.'

Degas practised and perfected his techniques at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris. In 1856, he moved toItalyfor three years to learn from the great works of Michelangelo, Raphael, Titian and other Renaissance artists. Later on, in 1872, he also spent a year or so in New Orleans staying with an uncle and painting pictures of family members.

Degas enrolled in the National Guard in 1870 and defendedParisin the Franco-Prussian war. During his time in the force, he discovered problems with his eyesight - something that worried him throughout the rest of his life.

Despite being one of the founders of Impressionism and taking a leading role in organising the first Impressionist exhibitions between 1876 and 1884, Degas disliked the term, preferring to think of himself as a realist.

Unlike many other Impressionist painters, Degas did not paint many landscapes and he did not often paint outdoors. His colours were generally more muted when compared, for example, to those of Claude Monet.

He was known to often mock the Impressionist painters, which caused conflicts within the group. He also was more conservative and did not like the furore caused by this new style of painting and their exhibitions.

In the late 1880s, Degas took up photography. He took photos of friends as well as of dance lessons and nudes, which were used as reference for his paintings.

During his life, Degas only exhibited one sculpture. In 1861, he showed the sculpture called 'The Little Dancer of Fourteen Years'. None of his other sculptures were exhibited until after his death when 150 wax sculptures were discovered in his studio.

Whether you agree with the detail of his theories or not,Sigmund Freud(6 May 1856 - 23 September 1939) is easily the most influential psychiatrist of all time.

(http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/92023/CB9786155F5344B6B0264617794CC2E5D2D3DF85.html)

'Sigmund Freud', The Royal Library: The National Library of Denmark and Copenhagen University Library and The European Library, CC BY-NC-ND

He popularised what we now know as 'psychoanalysis' - a type of treatment which allows analysts to access a patient's unconscious mind and their repressed feelings and emotions.

He identified aspects of the patient-analyst relationship that are still relevant today, such as 'transference', where a patient projects the feelings they have toward a care-giver onto the analyst, as well as concepts like 'ego' and 'id'. He also did a lot of work on the development of sexuality, identifying the existence of libido.

He is famous for his interpretations of patients' dreams and for his development of what became known as the Oedipus Complex.

It was Freud who pioneered the idea of closely examining a patient's childhood, in particular their relationship to their mother and father (or others who played that role), in order to allow them to come to terms with those relationships and to progress successfully to a state of maturity, or adulthood.

The Oedipus complex neatly uses the Greek myth ofOedipusto explain how a young boy's parental attachments change. To put it bluntly, the idea is that the boy ends up wanting to kill his father and marry his mother.

In more subtle terms, this means that the boy sees his father as competition for his mother's affection (which he wants) and so is both jealous of and afraid of his father's power. An unresolved Oedipus Complex in a boy leaves him in competition with his father. To progress to maturity, the boy must get out of the 'mummy's boy' phase, detaching his affections from his mother and engaging once again with his father.

In a girl it's the other way round. The girl begins by having a strong attachment to the mother, which then ends in favour of an attachment to the father (again the child sees the other parent as a competitor). Freud theorised that the mother becomes an object of hate when the girl realises that it was the mother who made her female, and thus lacking in power and key physical attributes! To progress to maturity, the girl must relinquish her desire for her father and make peace with her relationship with her mother - stop being a 'daddy's girl'.

(http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/90402/F46D559C8D158B076610A13D9247F11CFD9CB184.html)

The other famous part of the Oedipus myth is his encounter with the riddling Sphinx. 'Oedipus en de sfinx', Rijksmuseum, public domain

Freud's theories were not universally accepted exactly as he proposed them.

They were developed upon by later psychoanalysts, like his student Carl Jung (who developed the female Oedipus Complex into the Electra Complex) and Melanie Klein (who expanded on Freud's notions of the development of sexuality in children, particularly girls).

Freud's notions of female sexuality were the cause of much feminist objection. For Freud, the resolution of a girl's Oedipus Complex was the only route to 'normal' femininity. If the situation was not resolved, it could lead to neurosis or a masculinity complex!

Freud was practising during the first wave of feminism. So whilst the concept of ‘normal femininity’ may have been evident to Freud, other parts of society very close to him were beginning to question and object to it.

Freud was born in the Czech Republic, one of eight children. The family moved to Vienna, Austria, when Freud was aged three. At school, Sigmund Freud was an excellent student, who developed a passion for literature and in particular, Shakespeare. Sigmund went to university in Vienna, joining the medical faculty and studying physiology, philosophy and zoology.

In 1886, he set up private practice, specialising in 'nervous disorders'. In the same year he married Martha Bernays, and the couple went on to have six children. In the 1880s, Freud took cocaine and recommended its use in medicine, including as an antidepressant and as a cure for morphine addiction. In 1923, Freud developed cancer of the mouth because of his heavy smoking.

In 1930, he was awarded the Goethe Prize in recognition of his contributions to psychology and to German literary culture. In January 1933, the Nazis took control of Germany, and Freud's books were prominent among those they burned and destroyed. Freud died of mouth cancer in 1939 at the age of 83.

Exploring the history of hairstyling

Curls, twists, waves, updos or a good quiff, these are just a few examples of the popular hair styles in the 20th century.

We've been worrying about how our hair looks since thousands of years ago. Even the big Greek writers Aristophanes and Homer both mentioned hairdressing in their writings.

The word 'hairdresser' appeared in Europe in the 1600s. Since then, hairdressing has been considered a profession. But in the early days of  hair styling, only the wealthy men and women could afford a hairdresser.

During the 20th century, beauty salons became more popular, as did the barbershop for men. More and more salons opened and became the place where people would go to socialise and get a perfect new hairdo. Below we have gathered some great photos of hairdressers and their happy visitors.

Once upon a time... four words that conjure up images of fairy tales. Princesses and castles, talking animals, love and magic, Prince Charmings and happily ever afters. But the tales written down by the Brothers Grimm were not so sweet. (I say 'written down' and not 'written' because versions of many of the stories were common in folklore long before they were recorded on paper.)



Red Riding Hood and the wolf. 'Pull the bobbin and the latch will go up', Rijksmuseum, public domain

The world of Grimm's fairy tales isn't pretty and pink with cheerful turtle-doves that help with the housework, their stories are of a dark and cruel world. For example, in the Grimm versions: - Cinderella's ugly stepsisters cut bits off their own feet (a toe and a heel) to try and fit into the golden (not glass!) slipper - Having been deliberately abandoned with his sister by a mother who saw them as a financial burden, Hansel sticks a bone - presumably belonging to another long-dead child - through the bars of the cage in which he is being held to fool a child-eating witch into believing that he is not yet fat enough to make a good meal - Grandmother and Little Red Riding Hood are both eaten by the wolf and only survive because the huntsman slices the wolf's belly open - Rapunzel gives birth to twins following the illicit visits from her prince.

The first edition of Jacob (who died on 20 September in 1863) and Wilhelm Grimm'sKinder-und Hausmärchen(Children's and Household Tales) was published in 1812, with a second volume following in 1814 and a third in 1822.

Despite being written for children, the tales were widely regarded as unsuitable - not surprising considering their dark and violent nature. Over the years, other editors and storytellers have sanitised the stories, removing the sexual references and violence. But the moral teachings remain - if you do bad things, bad things will come to you: the wolf is killed; as is Hansel and Gretel's captor; Cinderella's sisters have their eyes pecked out by pigeons. While if you are good, you will get your happy ending: hero and heroine are married and live happily ever after; Rapunzel's tears fall on her prince's eyes and restore his sight; Hansel and Gretel are reunited with their loving father; Little Red Riding Hood learned never to stray off the woodland paths again.

And then we have the fairy tales rewritten in the 20th century for today's audiences - politically correct and feminist versions among them. ATelegraph article from 2009notes that many parents had stopped reading fairy tales to their children because they are not 'PC' enough. So here's a response to that - a tongue-in-cheek politically correct version of Snow White in which the stepmother used a magic mirror because 'years of social conditioning in a male hierarchical dictatorship had left the queen very insecure about her own self-worth'.

4-10 October is  World Space Week. In this blog, we explore how the human race has viewed space through the ages - from medieval astronomical diagrams to modern cartoons. You can also watch the 1978 launch of space shuttle ‘Enterprise’ at Cape Canaveral and listen to Holst’s ‘Planets’ orchestral suite.

If there's one thing we can be pretty sure of never fully understanding, it's space. Ever expanding, defying our notions of how things like time and motion work, fascinating us with its potential and shaping our everyday lives. We measure time by the movement of planets and stars, our daily activities are shaped by the presence or absence of light from our nearest star separating night from day, our holidays are linked to the seasons that result from the amount of warmth and light we receive from the sun. We might think that it's us human beings who organise the world around us, but is it really? Aren't we really at the mercy of the heavens?

It's certain we know a lot more now than we knew a century or two ago, but we've still got a long way to go. Remember, it is only 2,600 years since Pythagorus gave us the theory that the earth was spherical and not flat. That's not a long time ago in the great scheme of things. And whilst the observation of the heavens is presumably as ancient as the human race, exploration of space only really began in 1957 with the first man-made object to orbit the earth - Sputnik 1. The first person went into space just 52 years ago. But now, Virgin Galactic is taking bookings for pleasure trips into space at a cost of 250,000 US dollars (approximately 188,000 euros), and scientists, engineers and astronauts are working on a manned mission to Mars in the next few years.

If you fancy journeying into space, or if you'd rather just observe from the safety of your armchair, check out this video from Europeana  of the preparations for the launch of space shuttle Enterprise in 1978.

But how did people map space and the stars before the advent of the technology we use now? This gallery of images from Europeana looks at depictions of the heavens through the ages, from the 1400s to the 1970s. Browse the pictures whilst listening to a selection from Holst's Planets suite - there's a SoundCloud player below the gallery...

We can know only that we know nothing. And that is the highest degree of human wisdom.Leo Tolstoy, War and Peace.

Count Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy, also known as Leo Tolstoy, was born on 9 September 1828 to a family of old Russian nobility. Tolstoy married Sophia Andreevna Behrs, known as 'Sonya' in 1862 and the couple had 13 children.

Tolstoy's most famous work,War and Peace(published in 1869), is widely regarded as one of the greatest novels ever written.

And one of the longest. The book includes 560,000 words and 580 characters. But it's not the longest book ever. That accolade is thought to go to Proust'sIn Search of Lost Time.

ReadWar and Peacein FrenchorEnglish.

Although Tolstoy is described by many as the world's greatest novelist, he didn't view his masterpieceWar and Peaceas a novel at all.

What's more, later in life, he rejected the book, along withAnna Karenina, (which he did view as a novel, his definition being 'a framework for the examination of social and political issues in nineteenth-century life') because in his opinion, the books were not true to reality.

In the 1870s, Tolstoy's view of the world changed. He experienced a spiritual awakening and moral crisis. He became a Christian anarchist - a pacifist who renounced the state as violent and deceitful. His views on non-violent resistance influenced Gandhi and Martin Luther King.

As Tolstoy's beliefs became more radical, he started to reject both his inherited and his earned wealth, giving most of it away to charitable causes. He also renounced the copyright to his earlier works, stopping him earning any more money from them. The extent of his wealth-giving caused great tensions in his marriage to Sonya.

When was the first Porsche car made?

What else did Ferdinand Porsche design?

What happened to Porsche after World War II?

Ferdinand Porsche was an automative designer and inventor, the founder of the Porsche car company

Ferdinand Porsche, the Austrian-German engineer behind the car that bears his name, was born on 3 September 1875.

A hard worker even at a young age, he attended technical college at night after helping his father in his mechanical shop during the day. Aged 18, he landed a job with an electrical company and sneaked into university at night to learn more.

The first Porsche (the Lohner-Porsche electric car) was unveiled in 1898 and was presented at the World Fair inParisin 1900.

The electric car had such a heavy battery pack that it could not easily travel uphill or travel very far before the batteries ran out. The solution that Ferdinand came up with? An internal combustion engine fitted to a generator to drive electric hub motors with just a small battery pack - the first petroleum electric hybrid vehicle ever.

In 1906, Ferdinand had progressed to being chief designer at Austro-Daimler. Four years later, he drove a Austro-Daimler touring car to a triple victory in the Prince Henry Trials.

It wasn't just Porsches that Ferdinand designed.

In 1923, he designed the legendary Mercedes Compressor Sports Car. In 1933, he made  a Grand Prix race car. In 1934, the VW Beetle - the first of which was built in the garage at Ferdinand's villa in Stuttgart - was a response to Hitler's desire to have someone design a people's car ('Volkswagen').

And it wasn't just cars that Ferdinand turned his hand to - he contributed to the design of German tanks, aircrafts and weapons. He was awarded the German National Prize for Art and Science, one of the rarest decorations in Nazi Germany.

After moving the production of Volkswagen to France in 1945, Ferdinand and his son Ferry were both arrested by French authorities as war criminals. Ferdinand was held without trial in prison in Dijon for 20 months.

The Porsche family returned to Stuttgart in 1949 but found it difficult to start the business again, as banks wouldn't give them credit. Ferry's business sense saved the day as he sold cars to Volkswagen collecting payment in advance. Ferdinand got consulting work from Volkswagen and a royalty on every Type I Beetle sold.

After suffering a stroke, Ferdinand Porsche died in 1951. In 1999, he was named as 'Car Engineer of the Century' by the Global Automotive Elections Foundation. In 2012, nearly 150,000 Porsches were sold worldwide, the most popular model being the Cayenne.

Pukovnik Nedic u borbi - Battle of the Black Stone

Vojska na Banjici - Life of Serbian Soldiers in Banyitsa Army Camp

When the Second Balkan War broke out 100 years ago in 1913, an ambitious entrepreneur from Serbia made a remarkable decision: Dyordye Dyoka Bogdanović sent two camera operators out to the theatres of war.

Driven by strong patriotism, he first and foremost wanted to honour the Serbian armed forces by capturing their fighting using moving images. In doing so, Bogdanović established a new form of war reporting.

Dyoka Bogdanović was no newcomer tocinema.

Born to a lawyer’s family in 1860, he set up Belgrade’s first movie theatres in 1905.

The experiences of the First Balkan War (1912–1913) led to his idea to re-enact Serbian victories for the camera. In order to realise this plan, Bogdanović contracted two camera operators who were working for the Vienna outpost of Pathé, Europe’s leading producer of newsreels. In the midst of the filming preparations, in June 1913, Bulgaria attacked Serbia and Greece, thus unleashing the Second Balkan War.

Bogdanović immediately understood that this was his chance to film real combat operations instead of re-enacted ones. He decided to abandon his original plans and send his camera operators to the front. During the month of July, the men – whose names are unknown even today – shot footage of battles, of devastated villages, of war victims, of prisoners of war, and of soldiers in their everyday life.

Out of this footage, Bogdanović quickly compiled a number of short documentaries and newsreels. These films are noteworthy not only because few other moving images of the Second Balkan War exist, but also because they rank among the earliest cinematic recordings showing soldiers in action in real war situations.

As part of the EFG1914 project, theJugoslovenska Kinotekahas made some of these silent films available on theEuropean Film Gateway.

One of them,Pukovnik Nedić u borbi(Battle of the Black Stone), shows an artillery unit in various parts of its mission.

Another,Vojska na Banjici(Life of Serbian Soldiers in Banyitsa Army Camp), is remarkable for depicting soldiers performing a folk-dance in their free time.

Several other silent films by Dyoka Bogdanović are available on Europeana and on theEuropean Film Gateway:

When World War I broke out in 1914, Bogdanović took up war reporting again.

In cooperation with a Russian-born journalist, Sampson Tchernoff, he went to the front himself and filmed, among other things, Serbian troops in the Syrmia region. However, suffering from a serious injury he'd received in 1913 while filming near Crni Vrh, he died at the end of 1914 in Niš, having witnessed only the first few weeks of the conflict.

'It's all very Brechtian' - a phrase we've heard many times referring to some theatrical production or other. I take it to mean that there's minimal set, the actors are all very serious, they wear black and they spend most of their time with their backs to the audience.

So, to me, Brecht looks like something like this...

But what does the term 'Brechtian' really mean?

Bertolt Brecht was a German playwright, he was born in 1898 and died on the 14 August 1956, aged 58.

As well as his many plays, Brecht wrote a lot about the theory behind his works and the dramatic devices he used. Some of the terms used to describe these devices are: epic theatre, verfremdungsteffekt/alienation effect, didacticism, breaking the fourth wall, gestus, narration and use of song.

Those terms may not mean much to you unless you're already familiar with theatre and its techniques. In a nutshell, Brecht wanted to make his audiences think, not just feel. He objected to theatre presenting events as reality and thought that left little room for political or social comment.

Brecht changed the rules of theatre, disrupting the sense of reality by distancing the actors and audiences from the events being portrayed, making things that should be familiar strange in order to make the audience think rather than simply accept, and using contradictions to create complex characters.

By doing this, Brecht created something radical, a new style of theatre that allowed him to make the political and social comment he desired.Find out more about Brecht's techniques.

Mother Courage and her Childrenis possibly Brecht's most famous play. It is an anti-war play thought by some to be the greatest play of the 20th century. It was written in 1939 after Germany invaded Poland, and first performed in 1941.

The Threepenny Operais a musical Brecht wrote with composer Kurt Weill which was adapted from John Gay'sThe Beggar's Operaand is a critique of the capitalist world.

It mocked the sentimental musical and was a great success, but because the audience loved the sentiment and missed the humour. You may even know one of its songs without knowing its origin. The famous song Mack the Knife, sung by amongst others Bing Crosby, Ella Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra and Robbie Williams, comes from the show's 'The Ballad of Mack the Knife'.

Below is a gallery of posters and magazine spreads from Brecht's plays. All of which you canfind on Europeanaand are public domain images from Hungarian Theatre Museum and Institute and e-Library for Performing Arts.

As someone with an interest in all types of music and musical instruments from around the world, the wealth of information that is onEuropeanastill continues to amaze me.

I'd like to introduce you to a kind of musical instrument you may not be familiar with - the 'valiha' or 'marouvani'.

You can findseveral examples of them on Europeana. It is a stringed instrument from Madagascar and its generic name, under theHornbostel-Sachs classification system, is a 'whole tube zither'.

The body of the instrument is made from a single piece of tube which bears the strings. In the case of the valiha, the whole tube in question is a piece of thick bamboo.



'Valiha', Musical Instrument Museums Online, CC-BY-NC-SA

In this example, you can see that the valiha’s strings are formed by splitting strips of wood away from the main bamboo tube, between two nodes (like the black band you see to the right of the picture). The strips of bamboo are then raised on small bridges (the stud shaped like a flower in the picture). These bridges allow the strings to be plucked or struck and, by varying the length of the strips around the tube, different pitches are produced.



'Valiha', Musical Instruments Museums Online, CC-BY-NC-SA

If the instrument's body and its strings are of the same material, it is known as an 'idiochord tube zither'. But the strings of a valiha can also be of a different material to the body – such as the one pictured below which has brass strings – making the instrument a 'heterochord zither'.

On 23 August 1989, two million people held hands to form a human chain over 600 kilometres long linking three capital cities - Tallinn in Estonia, Riga in Latvia and Vilnius in Lithuania. This peaceful political demonstration became known as'The Baltic Way'.

The Baltic Way was a massive demonstration for freedom, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the signing of the1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pactbetwen Hitler and Stalin, which had paved the way for the Soviet occupation of the Baltic States.

One in four people in the three Baltic States took part - young and old, in some cases several generations of the same families.

The chain publicised their cause to the world and symbolised solidarity. It was the biggest demonstration in the history of the Soviet Union and the turning point for the struggle for freedom of the Baltic States, with each state showing its desire for independence.

Within six months of the protest, Lithuania became the first of the Republics of the Soviet Union to declare independence

23 August is now an official day of remembrance known as Black Ribbon Day or the European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism.

The photographs in this blog are personal mementos, contributed by people from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania who took part in collection day events held in 2013 and 2014 where people shared their memories of 1989 and the Fall of the Iron Curtain.

Vincent Van Goghdied on 29 July 1890, aged 37.

Some of his paintings, like his famous sunflowers, chair, starry night, terrace cafe and bedroom, are amongst the most distinctive and recognisable (and certainly the most popular at student poster sales) in the world.

But are you familiar with these two?

They are both part of a series Van Gogh painted during a period of very intense creativity between August and October 1888, when he was staying in the south of France. The first isThe entrance to the public garden in Arlesand the second isWalk in Arles.

In a short period of ten years, Van Gogh made approximately 900 paintings.

He only sold one painting during his lifetime and only became famous after his death. He suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy as well as other mental and physical conditions. He had an older brother who died at birth. His name was also Vincent van Gogh. Vincent’s brother Theo died six months after Vincent and is buried next to him in Auvers, France.

Samuel Taylor Coleridge, author ofThe Rime of the Ancient MarinerandKubla Khandied on 25 July 1834.

Europeana contains a great collection relating to Coleridge, from a variety of sources including institutions in the UK, Germany and Poland. Coleridge was an English poet, literary critic and philosopher, a friend of poet William Wordsworth, and an opium addict. His critical work on Shakespeare was highly influential. With his friend Robert Southey, he tried to found a utopian commune-like society called Pantisocracy - but it didn't last long.

Coleridge's longest poem,The Rime of the Ancient Marinerwas first published in 1798 and marked the start of British romantic literature.

It tells the tale of a sailor who has returned from a long and adventurous voyage at sea, which included an encounter with Death and being struck by a curse.

The poem was the first to coin several phrases now in common use in the English language, including to have 'an albatross around one's neck', meaning to be burdened by something you have done, 'water, water, everywhere, but not a drop to drink', and 'a sadder and a wiser man'. Coleridge also invented the term 'suspension of disbelief', which we use to describe how readers, film-viewers or audiences go along with a fantastical narrative - if the human interest and internal logic is sufficient, we will ignore the fantastical elements or the logic that doesn't fit with our real world experiences.

This stunning copy ofThe Rime of the Ancient Marinerwas given as a present to Countess Roman Potocka in 1912 by a John Lister-Kaye - see the handwritten inscription inside the book. Its illustrations are fantastic - well worth a browse, even if you're not into the poetry - a selection of pages are displayed below.

You can also readThe Rime of the Ancient Marinerin French.

Europeana also holds an extract froma handwritten letter to a Mr Alsoppas well astwo printed volumes of  lettersand a fascinating publication calledSpecimens of the table talk of the late Samuel Taylor Coleridgewhich seems to me to be his musings on a huge variety of topics from politics to children and dogs. I'll leave you with his thoughts on the latter...

January 1. 1832. GRACEFULNESS OF CHILDREN. -  DOGS. How inimitably graceful children are before they learn to dance! There seems a sort of sympathy between the more generous dogs and little children. I believe an instance of a little child being attacked by a large dog is very rare indeed.

Today we’re going Irish! To celebrate the Irish Presidency of the European Council, the Digital Agenda Assembly which is taking place this week in Dublin, and the associated Europeana Conference tomorrow at Dublin Castle, we have a guest blog from Grace Toland, Librarian of the Irish Traditional Music Archive (ITMA). 2,000 items from the fantastic ITMA collections are nowavailable in Europeana. Here's what Grace has to say about it...Welcome to the Irish Traditional Music Archive, the world’s largest multimedia collection of  Irish traditional music material. Through ourDigital Library, we invite you to discover the rhythms, melodies, voices and instruments of this vibrant expression of Irish culture.  ITMA, now celebrating its 25th year, is proud to share with you the unfolding story of Ireland’s traditional music via the Europeana portal. To help you along your musical journey, ITMA staff have selected some of their personal song, instrumental and dance favourites from the sound recordings, videos, images and texts available. We also recommend browsing the variousmedia playlistswhich are curated and introduced by ITMA Director, Nicholas Carolan. Updated bi-monthly, there will always be something new to discover, as well as the pleasure of returning to favourite pieces.

The development of sound technology can be followed in our audio playlists, from wax cylinders to contemporary digital recordings. From this timeline, Brian Doyle, our Digitisation Officer, has selected dance music, polkas played byKilloran’s Pride of Erin Orchestra. These ‘crackling’ 78 rpm disks transport us across the Atlantic to 1930s New York and the new life of emigrant Irish musicians.

Composition and colour prompted Treasa Harkin, our Melodies & Images Officer, IT, to chooseThey Love Music Mightily, an image gallery of musicians and singers photographed in their own environments by Paul McCarthy. Photographs, paintings and drawings richly evoke the era and roots of the music and musicians.

Elaina Solon, ITMA Sound Recordings Officer, has chosen contemporary Irish dance videos. While group dancing is also practised in Ireland, this particular video shows a solo genre sean-nós (old style) which has seen a revival among younger dancers in recent times. Witness the symbiotic relationship between dancer and musician (and even sweeping brush) as well as the considerable ‘support’ from an admiring audience.

The passing of music and songs orally from generation to generation is characteristic of Irish traditional music. The 19th century saw the emergence of the antiquarian collector and the transcription of tunes and songs in manuscript and printed works. From our George Petrie Collection (ca. 1790−1866) Maeve Gebruers, ITMA Printed Materials Officer, has selected amanuscript tune transcription. Musical literacy and the oral tradition continue to play central roles in music transmission and education. Our onlineInteractive Scoresare among the range of newly emerging teaching tools, enhancing older printed sources for a new generation.

How did Elizabeth Fry help prisoners?

How did Elizabeth Fry become the first woman to give evidence in parliament?

Elizabeth Fry was a social reformer and philanthropist who fought to improve the lives of prisoners

Elizabeth Gurney, or Betsy as she was known, was born on 21 May 1780 to a wealthy family of bankers.

Her father, John Gurney, was a partner in Gurney's Bank, and her mother, Catherine Barclay, came from the family that founded Barclays Bank. Gurney's eventually merged with Barclays, which is now one of the world's biggest banks.

Today, Elizabeth's legacy is demonstrated by money. Quite literally - for 15 years, between 2002 and 2017, Elizabeth Fry's face could be seen on the Bank of England £5 note.

But it wasn't money that Elizabeth cared about. It was people. The kind of people not many other people bother about - prisoners.

She believed that prisons and the treatment of prisoners should be more humane. She fought for new legislation and won.

Brought up in a Quaker household (a conservative branch of Christianity also known as the Religious Society of Friends), Elizabeth was moved by the teachings of a Quaker preacher and, aged 18, began taking an interest in the poor, the sick and prisoners. She started a Sunday school to teach children to read, she visited the sick and gave clothes to the poor.

The majority of the next portion of her life was taken up with marrying Joseph Fry and having 11 children (five boys and six girls).

The first time she visited a prison - Newgate Prison inLondonin the early 1800s - she was horrified. She found cramped and squalid conditions, and prisoners held without reasonable trial.

Fry did what she could to help, taking food and clothes, even staying overnight there herself and encouraging members of the upper classes to do the same to experience it for themselves. In 1816, Elizabeth set up a school for the children who lived in prison with their parents.

A little nepotism never goes amiss. When Elizabeth's brother-in-law was elected to parliament, he campaigned on her behalf.

Elizabeth was able to address the House of Commons on the conditions faced in Britain's prisons. She was the first-ever woman to present evidence to parliament.

Her influence changed how prisons in the UK are run, and was partly responsible for Prime Minister Robert Peel's Gaols Act being passed in 1823.

Elizabeth Fry continued her campaigning, advocating for even further prison reform, especially for the quality of life for female prisoners. When her husband went bankrupt in 1828, her brother became her benefactor, allowing her to continue and expand her campaigning.

She campaigned and advocated for issues such as homelessness, slavery and welfare. Fry kept extensive diaries. She died, aged 65, in 1845. Just over twenty years later, in 1868, her daughter Rachel Elizabeth Fry publisheda memoir of her mother's life and work.

When were the first transatlantic flights?

Who were Charles Nungesser and François Coli?

What happened to L'Oiseau Blanc?

Who was the first aviator to cross the Atlantic?

Who were the pilots that tried to be the first to cross the Atlantic by plane?

Next week, I will be crossing the Atlantic Ocean on a non-stop flight from Amsterdam to Philadelphia. A common occurrence I hear you say - however, a little over 100 years ago, people were literally dying in their attempts to fly this particular stretch of ‘the pond’.

Today, it is a totally different story. Along with the flight I will be taking, tens of thousands of other commercial flights each week cross the Atlantic Ocean and make the world a smaller place.

In the 1920s, it was an unattained human and engineering feat that could be compared with man landing on the moon in the 1960s.

But look at what progress has been made: in 2010 alone, 2.5 million passengers crossed the Atlantic between London Heathrow and New York JFK airports, the busiest transatlantic route by a large margin.

The Atlantic Ocean stood as a significant obstacle to the aviation pioneers of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Now it is simply a way of getting from A to B - thanks to the efforts of a few brave aviators that we remember today.

On 8 May 1927, two French aviation heroes and veterans ofWorld War Iset off on an ill-fated flight.

Charles Nungesserand François Coli took off on a journey in an attempt to pilot the first non-stop transatlantic flight with a fixed-wing aircraft and bag the $25,000 Orteig Prize.

The prize was offered in May 1919 by New York hotel owner Raymond Orteig to the first allied aviator(s) to fly non-stop from New York City to Paris or vice-versa.

Most attempted to fly from New York to Paris, but a number of French aviators including Nungesser and Coli, planned an attempt to fly in the opposite direction, from Paris to New York. The pair flew a specially built Levasseur PL.8, a single engine, two-seat long-distance biplane aircraft modified from an existing Levasseur PL.4.

The aircraft took off from Paris.

The intended flight path was a great circular route, which would have taken them across the English Channel, over the southwestern part of England and Ireland, across the Atlantic to Newfoundland, then south over Nova Scotia, to Boston, and finally to a water landing in New York.

Crowds of people gathered in New York to witness the historic arrival, with tens of thousands of people crowding Battery Park in Manhattan to have a good view of the Statue of Liberty, where the aircraft was scheduled to touch down.

After their estimated time of arrival had passed, with no word as to the aircraft's fate, it was realised that the aircraft had been lost.

The disappearance of L'Oiseau Blanc is considered one of the great mysteries in the history of aviation.

Several famous aviators made unsuccessful attempts at the New York to Paris flight before relatively unknown AmericanCharles Lindberghwon the prize in 1927 in his aircraft Spirit of Saint Louis.

The disappearance of L'Oiseau Blanc has been called 'the Everest of aviation mysteries'.

If the aircraft had successfully completed its journey, Lindbergh would probably not have made his own historic flight, and might instead have set his sights on crossing the Pacific. This might have preventedAmelia Earhartfrom attempting her own journey.

When Lindbergh did succeed with his own flight across the Atlantic, the international attention on his achievement was probably enhanced because of the disappearance of 'L'Oiseau Blanc just days earlier.

So the next time you are on a transatlantic flight, at 30,000 feet looking down at the mass expanse of the Atlantic, spare a thought for the pioneers who were brave enough to advance humanity’s ambitions to go faster, further and higher.

Facts about Tchaikovsky

Tchaikovsky on Europeana

Costume designs for Tchaikovsky ballets

Tchaikovsky was a Romantic composer from Russia, whose music has become beloved worldwide

Today, we celebrate a great composer's birthday. Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky was born on 7 May 1840, in Votkinsk, Russia.

I have always loved Tchaikovsky's ballet music. I remember dancing around to theDance of the Sugar Plum Fairyand feeling the romance and tragedy ofSwan Lake. I also got hold of a book of sheet music forThe Nutcrackerto play on the piano myself. 15 years later, it is still painful to me that I cannot master it, but his music continues to capture my imagination because of the wonderful stories it depicts.

Did you know...

Tchaikovsky loved Mozart, found Wagner boring and hated Brahms (with whom he shared a birthday!).

As a child, Tchaikovsky complained that he could not sleep because of the music in his head.

Music did not become Tchaikovsky's life until age 23 when he left his clerk's job at the Ministry of Justice.

Europeana holds hundreds ofrecordings of Tchaikovsky's music, lots ofvideos related to him, and some of hissheet music, such as this handwritten and signed example of a song called 'Romance'.

How about a twist on a Tchaikovsky classic by another great composer? Claude Debussy arranged 'Le lac des cygnes' as a duet on piano (four hands - one piano!).

Tchaikovsky's music inspired wonderful sets and costumes in its productions.

Here's a souvenir programme from a 1921 production of 'The Sleeping Princess' (otherwise known as 'Sleeping Beauty') at the Alhambra Theatre, London. It contains a synopsis of the story as well as an article by Leon Bakst, producer and designer, about his passion for Tchaikovsky's ballets and a nervous first encounter with the man himself when Bakst was just a young student.

Flick through the programme to see a range of wonderful costume and set designs, as well as letter from composer Igor Stravinksy, expressing his delight at the new production of Tchaikovsky's work.

After a 10 year long makeover, Amsterdam’s Rijksmuseum is getting ready to open its door again.

The Rijksmuseum is the Dutch national museum of art and history, where masterpieces by Rembrandt van Rijn, Jan Steen, Frans Hals, Johannes Vermeer and other great painters, mingle with 17th-century blunderbusses and Delft blue pottery.

The 128 year old neo-gothic building has been totally revamped, and all 8,000 artifacts can now be found in a different place.

With the new format, you will be able to walk through a time period. This is very different compared to the old museum, where there were separate rooms for paintings, glass, silver, and other collections. The intention of this new format is to create a feeling of beauty in relation to Dutch art and a feeling for the time itself. The museum opens its doors this Saturday, can’t wait till then?

Take a look at some of their masterpieces on Europeana!

As you may know, one of Europeana's projects is collecting personal stories and memories from World War I.Europeana 1914-1918is a crowd-sourced project.

That means that it is you, its users, the members of the public, who make it what it is. It's your contributions, your stories, your time and effort. So far, with your help, we've collected more than 2,500 stories and 40,000 digital files to illustrate them. A huge thank you from all of us.

One contributor, however, has gone even further than simply submitting his family stories to the archive.

Christian Reinboth from Germany hasblogged about itand offered to set up a 'Europeana Day' in his home town to help others to add their stories to the collection.

Christian's great-great uncle Friedrich Reinboth fought in World War I and, unfortunately, didn't come home from the Ukraine to his native Nordhausen, Germany.

Looking through the family attics, Christian found not only postcards and letters from him but also drawings, certificates and other military documents as well as handwritten field diaries from Friedrich's 7-year stint in a Hussarian regiment.



A photograph of the two brothers Friedrich (left) and Carl Reinboth (right), taken some time in the year of 1914. The older brother Friedrich is dressed in the parade uniform of the 14. Hussarian Regiment 'Friedrich II von Hessen-Homburg', in which he served during World War One.

So how did Christian find out about the Europeana 1914-1918 project?

He says, 'Over the last few years, I have done volunteer work for theMuseumsverband Sachsen-Anhalt, which is currently organising a touring exhibition about the First World War, which will be shown in many museums in Saxony-Anhalt from 2014 to 2018. Additionally, many exhibits related to the First World War are being digitised by the museums for the digitisation projectmuseum-digital, which, in turn, is connected to Europeana via the ATHENA project. It was in one of the digitisation workshops organised by the association in 2011, that I first heard about the Europeana 1914-1918 project.'

'When I subsequently browsed the 1914-1918 website, I read the call for participation and decided to get involved by digitising documents, photos and field postcards from the inheritance of my great-great-uncle Friedrich Reinboth, who served in the 14. Hussarian Regiment Friedrich II von Hessen-Homburg during World War One and who died on March 21st 1918 during an encounter in the Ukraine.

So far, I have been able to contribute13 exhibitsto the project.

Digitising these has also inspired me to take up the task of transcribing Friedrich's hand-written war diary - as of today, I have transcribed all entries from July of 1914 ('The enthusiasm for the upcoming war is rising') to August of 1915.'



War diary of Friedrich Reinboth. The pictured diary is the first of three conserved war diaries covering the time between 1914 and 1917.

Christian is now encouraging others in the Walkenried area of Germany (an area with 4,600 residents in the Harz mountains) to contribute too. Christian offers to set up scanners, digital cameras and internet stations at the local museum in order to help others with the technical side of contributing. He has even put a short video together and posted it on YouTube.

Christian says, 'Since I have had the opportunity to explore our own family archive in search of documents, letters and diaries written during World War I, I have becore more and more convinced that there are many undiscovered historical gems and untold family stories out there, that would certainly deserve to be preserved in the Europeana archives.'

In his blog, Christian, who is a computer scientist by day, also picks out some stories from the Europeana 1914-1918 archive that he finds most interesting.

He recommends adiary of a British nursewith signatures of the wounded people she cared for, this1914 letter giving a Tyrolean infantryman permission to stay out until 10 o'clockand thispostcard from a Prague hospitalfrom the year 1916.

Christian ends his blog with a sentiment that I'm sure we all share: 'So let's work together to ensure that the memories remain and that we collect the very personal family stories of this destructive and cruel war for the benefit of future generations.'

--------------------------------------------------

Federico García Lorca was a Spanish poet, playwright and theatre director.

A love of music got Lorca into writing. He was a trained classical pianist, and it was only when his piano teacher died in 1916, when Lorca was 18 years old, that he began to write.

His first works were inspired by musical forms and at one stage, he wrote essays on the art of flamenco. Lorca's first work of poetry was was published in 1921, and explored the themes of religious faith, isolation and nature. The poetry that became best-known was a book calledRomancero Gitano(Gypsy Ballads),published in 1928.

The work was influenced by Spain's avant-garde and Lorca called it a 'carved altar piece' of Andalusia with 'gypsies, horses, archangels, planets, its Jewish and Roman breezes, rivers, crimes, the everyday touch of the smuggler and the celestial note of the naked children of Córdoba. A book that hardly expresses visible Andalusia at all, but where the hidden Andalusia trembles.'

Here's an extract from one of the poems inGypsy Ballads:

Green wind. Green branches.The ship out on the seaand the horse on the mountain.With the shadow at the waistshe dreams on her balcony,green flesh, green hair,with eyes of cold silver.

Federico García Lorca,Romance Sonámbulo (Ballad of the Sleepwalker)

At around the time this book of poetry was published (1927-28), Lorca became part of what became known as the 'Generation of '27' - an influential group of poets in Spain interested in the avant-garde (experimental forms of art and poetry). The group was split up nearly a decade later with the start of the Spanish Civil War.

Despite his success and new-found fame, all did not go smoothly for Lorca.

Whilst he was a student in Madrid, Lorca met and became friends with other creative artists, including Salvador Dalí, who provided the stage settings for Lorca's playMariana Pineda.The relationship between the two artists became passionate, at least on Lorca's side, but Dalí rejected his amorous advances.

Following Lorca's success withGypsy Ballads, he became estranged from Dalí and other friends, who began collaborating without him. Lorca slumped into a depression and so he and his family set sail for America to get away from the source of his anguish.

He returned to Spain in 1930 and was appointed as director of a university student theatre company, Teatro Universitario la Barraca. He then wrote his 'Rural Trilogy' of plays which all rebelled against the norms of bourgeois Spanish society -Yerma,Blood WeddingandThe House of Bernarda Alba.

Lorca's plays and poetry are full of melancholy and tragedy. As the man himself once said, 'At the heart of all great art is an essential melancholy.' His works challenged the conventions of the time, questioned the accepted role of women in society and explored homoeroticism and class.

These were things that would put him in danger.

In 1936, the Spanish Civil War broke out, and Lorca knew that the strengthening right wing would be suspicious of him and his outspoken liberal views. What happened next is still largely speculation. He is believed to have been shot and killed, aged just 38, by the national militia but this has never been officially confirmed. The motive for his assassination is also uncertain: some believe he was targeted for being gay, a socialist, or both, while others think that a personal dispute was the more likely cause.

It is thought that he was buried with three other men. However, in 2009, 2014 and again in 2016, excavations at likely sites of his grave found nothing. So Lorca's death and burial remain a mystery.

To end, Lorca's poem 'Hour of Stars' from 1920:

The round silence of night,one note on the staveof the infinite.

Ripe with lost poems,I step naked into the street.The blackness riddledby the singing of crickets:sound,that deadwill-o'-the-wisp,that musical lightperceivedby the spirit.

A thousand butterfly skeletonssleep within my walls.

A wild crowd of young breezesover the river.

This blog was updated in 2022 with additional details about the search for Federico García Lorca's remains.

The Women's Peace Party (later the 'Women's International League for Peace and Freedom', WILPF), was founded in 1915 as a reaction to the outbreak of World War I in August 1914.

This association was founded at the Women's Peace Conference in The Hague, which was attended by several Danish women, including Thora Daugaard (1874-1951), Eline Hansen (1859-1919), Clara Tybjerg (1864-1941), Louise Wright (1861-1935) and Eva Moltesen (1871-1934).



All of these came all from the middle classes - typically independent women, but with different political and religious backgrounds.

Tybjerg and Hansen were both school teachers and candidates for the Social-Liberal Party. Moltesen was an author and candidate for the Danish Liberals in 1918 (the very first election in Denmark in which women got the right to stand for Parliament and to vote). Daugaard was an editor. Wright was a philanthropist of a Christian background.

Despite these differences, the women engaged themselves in common activities for peace.

In 1916 they founded a Danish branch of Women’s Peace Party,Danish Women's Peace Chain(Danske kvinder Fredskæde). They very successfully recruited members not just from among their peers, but also from the typically social-democrat women of the working class, including Henriette Crone (1874-1933), chairperson of the Women's Printing Union.



The Danish Women's Peace Chain was not a pacifist movement.

In the journalKvinden og Samfundet('Woman and Society') as well as in variouspamphlets, it was made clear that the Peace Chain 'isn't an association opposed to the national defence', and that the members 'on a par with women in other countries will devote themselves to the duty of upholding the independence of their country'.

It is probably fair to define the movement as 'defencist' – as expressed by the British historian, Martin Ceadel, i.e. accepting a Danish defence – but only in case of a breach of the peace from abroad.



The Danish peace movement had a tradition for such a policy of defensive neutrality.

Likewise, Fredrik Bajer (1837-1922), founder of Association for a Neutralized Denmark (Foreningen til Danmarks Nevtralisering)in 1882 and the later Danish Peace Movement (Dansk Fredsforening), was of the conviction that Denmark had to defend its neutrality by military means.

In a broader perspective, though, he had an optimistic view on progress and nurtured the almost evolutionary idea that wars were about to be replaced by legal disputes. Violent, military confrontations were concepts from a remote, barbaric past. But by the end of the 1800s, he still advocated for the need of safeguarding peace by military means.

As a consequence of the outbreak of World War I, Bajer's dream of peace was destroyed, and he withdrew from the peace movement.



Yet, the Danish Peace Movement lived on and - quite tragicomically - ended up in a harsh dispute with the newly established association, when a number of members criticised the foundation of Danish Women's Peace Chain.

For several years, this battle was fought through the columns ofFredsbladet(the 'Peace Journal') in a barrage of arguments for and against one united or a number of smaller movements.

Even as late as 1918, Henriette Beenfeldt (1878-1949) wrote, 'Through the Danish Peace Movement we will seriously hinder our common noble aim if we don't stop the discussion about this very soon and hereafter with sympathy look upon the foundation of the new movements, let alone the fact that such approach will serve us to a much greater honour'.

In short, neither the Danish Peace Movement nor Danish Women's Peace Chain were basically pacifist movements and, at least from the outset, didn't question the general conscript as did the syndicalists and members of the National League of Consistent Antimilitarists.

Other politicians also argued against war, such as the liberal politician Peter Munch (1870-1948) who advocated the solution of conflicts through parliamentary negotiations, arbitration and disarmament. Both he and the liberal internationalism, as pointed out by the Danish historian Karen Gram-Skjoldager, supported the rise of the pacifist movements in Europe and Russia through their antimilitarism.



For Munch, however, the outbreak of World War I also meant the collapse of the grand illusions.

In 1916, when Danish Women's Peace Chain was founded, he was certainly Minister of Defence in a neutral Denmark. But at the same time in a country that spent an enormous amount of resources on defending this neutrality.

Munch was responsible for a defence force of 50,000 men and the further development of a major fortification around Copenhagen (from Klampenborg in the north to Sydamager in the south). In his memoirs, he himself argued, 'From a bright time of progress in which our peace initiatives could be developed in a climate of relative security, we were forced into a climate of misfortune and hatred marked by complete insecurity'.

What made Nijinsky the star of the Ballet Russes?

What happened to Nijinsky in later life?

Vaslav Nijinsky was the greatest male ballet dancer of the early 20th century

Vaslav Nijinsky - or Wacław Niżyński - was the greatest male dancer of the early 20th century.

Born in Kiev in the then Russian Empire (now Ukraine) on 12 March 1889, his parents introduced him to dance. Aged just 9, he enrolled in the Imperial Ballet School in St Petersburg, the best ballet school around.

In 1909, he joined Ballet Russes, which aimed to take Russian ballet to Paris where its like had never been seen. Its artistic director Sergei Diaghilev had been born in Saint Petersburg and moved toParisin the early 1900s.

Nijinsky became the group's star male dancer, captivating audiences with every performance. His virtuosity, strength and characterisation were astounding, his gravity-defying leaps legendary. He was one of very few male dancers to be able to dance en pointe (on tip-toe with wooden blocks in his ballet shoes).

Although Nijinsky had found some success choreographing ballets while with Diaghilev, he was unsuccessful in starting his own ballet company without him.

DuringWorld War II, Nijinsky found himself under house arrest in Hungary as an enemy Russian citizen. He was only released when Diaghilev intervened, offering him a tour of America.

Sadly, the stress and strain of these years during which he had to manage his own tours and had few opportunities to dance, took its toll.

Nijinsky's mental health suffered as he obsessed over his love of ballet. Finally settling inSwitzerlandafter the war, things didn't get any better. Nijinsky's mental state deteriorated to such an extent that he was unable to dance in public again. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia and treatment proved unsuccessful.

From 1947, Nijinsky lived in Surrey, England, with his wife, where he died from kidney failure in 1950.

Who was Marie Curie?

How equal is education around the world?

Where did Marie Curie study?

What were Marie Curie's scientific discoveries?

What is Marie Curie's legacy?

How her pioneering research on radioactivity is changing women's lives today

This post was originally written for International Women's Day. To write it, we ran a poll onour Facebook pageasking our followers to vote for who they thought were the most influential and inspirationalwomen of history.

The poll options became a substantial list of great women including Jane Austen, Rosa Parks, Amelia Earhart, Mother Teresa and Joan of Arc. There was a very clear winner with 45% of the vote: Marie Skłodowska Curie.

Putting the Facebook poll together, to me, it was a list of interesting, historical people. Marie Curie was a name on a list of names. But since then, it's got personal.

This week, a close family member was diagnosed with breast cancer. Whilst this is clearly not good news, the prognosis is excellent due to early diagnosis and the decades of research that has now gone into treating the disease. This has made me think about the effect that one woman born around 150 years ago continues to have on the lives of women everywhere today.

Marie Skłodowska was born in 1867 in Warsaw,Poland. She was the youngest of five children. Her parents, Bronisława and Władysław, were both teachers. Her father lectured in maths and physics – both subjects Marie went on to pursue herself.

She applied for a place at Krakow University but was rejected because she was female. It's said that Marie then attended lectures in Krakow dressed as a man until she was discovered.

Marie and her sister Bronisława became involved with an organisation calledthe Flying University- a clandestine educational establishment teaching a pro-Polish curriculum in defiance of the Russian authorities, that was willing to admit female students.

United Nations statisticsshowed that there are equal numbers of men and women studying in 'primary' and 'secondary' education and that in'tertiary' education (also called 'further', 'higher' or 'continuing' education) worldwide, there are more girls than boys.

So that's it, education is equal the world over, right? Wrong. That's an average, and the figuresvary widely from country to country, for example, only 4% of women in Guinea enrol in a tertiary education, compared to 39% women in Indonesia.

In Europe, the figures are more balanced as these examples show - 49% of women above the age of 25 have achieved a tertiary education in the UK, 33% in France, 31.5% in Poland and 39% in Sweden.

However, the gender bias of subject matter is still strong.

In tertiary education, although enrolment is increasing faster for women than men, there are disparities in the fields of study, with women underrpresented in science, technology, engineering and maths. Women make up only around a third of graduates in maths, science and technology.

Imagine Marie's situation 130 years ago - not only did she pursue the unfeminine ambition of education, she was studying topics that were, and still are, traditionally under the remit of men.



'Marie Curie: Holograph Notebook', Wellcome Library, CC BY-NC.

Marie moved to Paris,France, in 1891, to join her sister, and to study at the University of Paris (La Sorbonne).

She earned two degrees - one in mathematics and one in physics, studying by day, and tutoring by night to earn money. Later, she became the University's first female professor.

In 1895, she married Pierre Curie, a tutor at the School of Physics and Chemistry in Paris.

She changed her name to Marie Skłodowska-Curie, maintaining the Polish part of her name and incorporating her husband's. Why then, I wonder, do we now know her only as Marie Curie? Whose decision was it to lose her maiden name? Was it because Marie Curie has a nice symmetry to it, or that there's a semantic and even poetic link between the name Curie and the word 'cure'? Or was it the effect of patriarchal tradition or cultural or political pressures?

In 1896, Marie took up a scientific puzzle that had stumped her colleague,Henri Becquerel, and cracked it herself.

In doing so, she discovered and named radioactivity, and worked out its relation to uranium. Years later, she wrote a biography of her husband and was careful to point out that these discoveries were hers and not Pierre's.

Following on from these discoveries, Marie went on to develop techniques for isolating radioactive isotopes, and discovered two new elements, polonium and radium. Under her direction, the world's first studies were conducted into the treatment of neoplasms (masses of tissue that can develop into cancer), using radioactive isotopes.

Marie's research and discoveries led to the radiotherapy treatment available to cancer patients today.

She was the firstwoman to be awarded a Nobel Prizeand the first person ever to receive two of them - the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1903 and the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1911.

For most cancer types, radiotherapy (or radiation therapy) is used 75% of the time with the intention of curing, rather than halting development of cancers.

It is the most cost-effective treatment for cancer and is involved in 40% of all cases in which cancer patients are cured.

World Health Organization figuresshow that over 18 million new cancer cases are diagnosed every year.

So with every year that goes by, Marie's discoveries take on even greater significance.

Frédéric François Chopin, Polish composer and pianist, was born on 22 February 1810. Chopin is considered one of the most significant composers of the Romantic age, although some great pianists have dismissed his work as 'excessively ornamental and trivial'.

Chopin was born in a village called Żelazowa Wola, near Warsaw, Poland. He studied music in Warsaw before leaving the country aged 20 and heading to Paris.

Despite being a prodigy, Chopin gave very few public performances - only around 30. Instead, he made his living teaching piano lessons and selling his compositions.

He is credited with inventing the instrumental ballade and made major innovations to the piano sonata, mazurka, waltz, nocturne, polonaise, étude, impromptu, scherzo and prélude.

Aside from the piano, the main love of his life was French writer Amantine Dupin, who wrote under the pen name George Sand, with whom he had a relationship between 1837-1847.

Chopin was always plagued with ill health and died aged just 39 in 1849.

Europeana holds a treasure trove of Chopin-related material, includingrecordings of his workandmusic manuscripts, many of them handwritten.

This one bears his name and his notes in the margin. It's a sonata for piano and cello (opus  65), and you can find arecording of it on Europeana. This is the last opus number that Chopin himself used.

On his deathbed, he requested that all remaining unpublished works be destroyed. Contrary to his wishes, his family published further works after his death as op. 66-74.

Here is another handwritten manuscript, this time of Chopin's famous 'Minute Waltz', or ' Waltz in D-flat major, Op. 64, No. 1'.

It is often thought that Chopin intended the waltz to be played in under a minute, but this is not the case. The emphasis is on the second syllable of the word 'minute', not the first, and so means 'small'.

Most performances of the waltz take between one-and-a-half to two-and-a-half minutes, although some pianists still take on the challenge of playing it super fast within 60 seconds - to do that they need to play at a rate of 420 quavers (quarter notes) per minute, or 7 per second. You can find a recording of theMinute Waltz on Europeana.

Exploring items and artworks related to love

Love it or hate it, today is Valentine's Day.

OK, so there's a lot of commercial nonsense around it, and if you go out for dinner tonight, you'll probably be disappointed with crowded restaurants, less-than-mouth-watering set menus, and bad service.

But that aside, I think it's rather nice.

I like to think of all the people nervously finding ways to tell someone they think they're great, the shy smiles, the first dates. And the more established couples who still find time to write a thoughtful  message in a card - or the ones, like some friends of mine, who invested in pretty cards several years ago and simply bring the same ones out each year and reminisce.

It's also a day that makes others feel lonely or sad, so why not buy a bunch of flowers for your single best friend or a family member, or just tell them how much you appreciate them?

Whatever you think about Valentine's Day, I hope you appreciate the items related to love that  I found in Europeana below.

Cynics should scroll down to the last one - it's more of an anti-Valentine. First up, tradition and a rather beautiful and elaborate 3D Valentine's card.

Now, we start to get a little cynical.

Have a read of this, it's a kind of love potion recipe called 'A receipt for a person to make her husband love her'. The first lines read '1st. Let her be meek & Humble & condescending in all things. Careful & reasonable to her husbands humour.' Hmm, I'm not sure about the meek and condescending thing - I'm glad I wasn't around in the early 1700s.

And finally, an apothecary mixing his own love potion of sorts - and one that I'd steer clear of! The verse reads: 'Oh, curse ye, you Your patients kill With naucious draughts and filthy Pill Tho you to death yourself should pine You neer shall be my Valentine'.

Happy Valentine's Day, one and all!

Today, researchers and academics at the University of Leicester, UK, confirmed that their investigations have led them to believe that a skeleton found under Grey Friars church car park in Leicester is that of King Richard III of England, who died in 1485.

]

Richard III, P.1489, Creator: Hollar, Wenzel, Rijksmuseum, public domain image

The skeleton matches contemporary descriptions of Richard's build, including spinal deformities, and had suffered ten injuries including eight to the skull. Extensive tests and investigations, including a DNA match to the maternal family line, have been carried out, and considered by the team of specialists.

The result is one of the most exciting archaeological discoveries of recent years. Richard Buckley, lead archaeologist, said at a press conference broadcast live on the BBC this morning that it is the team's academic view that 'beyond reasonable doubt the individual exhumed at Grey Friars on September 12th is indeed Richard III, the last Plantagenet king of England'.

Sir Peter Soulsby, Leicester City's Mayor, said that the remains of the King will be re-interred 'at Leicester Cathedral, in whose shadow the remains have laid for the last 500 years,' some time early next year.

Richard III (2 October 1452 – 22 August 1485) was King of England for two years, from 1483 until his death in 1485 during the Battle of Bosworth Field. He was the last king of the House of York and the last of the Plantagenet dynasty.

His defeat at the Battle of Bosworth Field was the decisive battle of the Wars of the Roses and is sometimes regarded as the end of the Middle Ages in England. He is the subject of a historical play by William Shakespeare - find it on Europeanahere.

How did Francis Bacon contribute to science?

Was Francis Bacon really the author of Shakespeare's plays?

Was Francis Bacon a member of secret societies?

How did Francis Bacon die?

Sir Francis Bacon, first Viscount of St Albans, was born on 22 January 1561.

He is well-known for his contribution to science.

Science and research is what it is today because of Bacon. The methodology of science and research, something we may not even think about as having an origin, of ever not existing, was Bacon's brainchild. He is the father of empiricism.

Bacon championed the need for inductive reasoning. That means being able to gradually generalise findings based on accumulated data - the more data you investigate, the more convincing your hypothesis.

So, Bacon has played his part in all of our educations -scienceexperiments would not be the same without him.

But did you know that some would say the same about English lessons?

A theory first published in the mid-19th century suggests that Sir Francis Bacon was the real author of some or even all of the plays that most of us believe were written by William Shakespeare.

Baconian theoryholds that Shakespeare was merely the front man, taking all the glory so that the important statesman would not be criticised as being a lowly public playwright. By finding another man to take the credit, Bacon's high ambitions to hold high office in government could remain achievable.

Scholars came up with this theory after perceiving similarities in the philosophies of Bacon as seen through his correspondence and the ideas put forward in Shakespeare's plays. Some also find codes and ciphers in the plays that point to Bacon.

But it has to be said that the vast majority of Shakespeare scholars reject this theory.

This isn't the only unusual claim about Bacon's life.

He is also thought to have been a member of secret societies. He is alleged to have had connections with the fraternity ofFreemasonsand German secret philosophical society,the Rosicrucians.

While there are scholars who don't believe this, others think that he was part of other closed intellectual movements, which he joined motivated by his passion for the advancement of  learning. His motto certainly bears this out:bene visit qui bene latuit- 'one lives best by the hidden life'.

His death, aged 65, has a touch of irony to it.

One day in April 1626, Bacon took a walk in the snow. Whilst on this walk, he had the idea of freezing meat to preserve it. He immediately bought a fowl and stuffed it with snow, whereupon he contracted pneumonia and died just a few days later.

In a letter, Bacon wrote on his deathbed to his friend Lord Arundel, he said:

As for the experiment itself, it succeeded excellently well.

Vintage photograph and postcards of Košice

Košice, Slovakia is the European Capital of Culture in 2013, along with Marseille in France. Let's take a trip to the city through vintage photograph and postcards.

Košice is Slovakia's second city, after the capital Bratislava, with a population of 240,000. It is situated on the river Hornád at the eastern reaches of the Slovak Ore Mountains, near the border with Hungary.

Previously part of the Kingdom of Hungary and Austria-Hungary, it is Kassa in Hungarian and Cassovia in Latin.

The city has a well preserved historical centre, which is the largest of all Slovak towns. There are many heritage-protected buildings in Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, and Art Nouveau styles.

The city is also home to Saint Elisabeth Cathedral, Slovakia's largest church.

The city was the first in Europe to be granted its own coat-of-arms.

The Europeana Fashion thesaurus

Today, Nacha Van Steen at Europeana Fashion partner Royal Museums of Art and History in Brussels, tells us about one of the technical challenges the project is facing – how to represent the world of fashion digitally so that you can explore it easily.

What springs to mind when I say ‘fashion’? Exactly, an immense variety of images, clothes, shoes, magazines, lifestyle choices, as diverse and complex as your own imagination.

Now imagine trying to capture all of that in words, and worse still, structure... And yet, that is exactly what the Europeana Fashion project has set out to do in creating athesauruson fashion, a reference that assembles all things fashion in a controlled, structured hierarchy, includingsynonymsandantonyms. The result will be a tree-like structure with branches for every topic within the world of fashion, ready to be discovered, explored and used for research or entertainment.

What is a dress? A dress is.. a main garment for the body.. or costume. Or can it be a nightgown? Or an underdress perhaps?

The thesaurus will be used to enrich metadata (information about digitised objects) within the Europeana Fashion project and to provide high quality disclosure of fashion-related content within Europeana itself.

Moreover, the thesaurus will be made publicly available on the project’sown website, ready to be used by all interested.

Because it will exist as a digital reference only, it can serve as a starting point for fashion researchers, can be expanded as the need arises and will hopefully encompass the richness and complexity that the fashion industry, from creator to manufacturer to buyer and collector, has to offer. The benefits are numerous: the vocabulary is controlled, can be translated (the Europeana Fashion Project offers 10 languages!), and the information can be retrieved in a fast, complete and orderly manner. Relationships become clear, data entry is simplified and a vast amount of knowledge is gathered in a logical, structured, organised way.

[http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2020108/F5E6D3DA93A81E44EC4CB30E2ED6C005D391A58E.html](Travelling exhibition from Finland, Marimekko: Fab, Slovenian National E-content Aggregator, CC-BY-ND)

For you, as a Europeana user, Europeana Fashion’s thesaurus will give you the opportunity to search for fashion-related content in each of the 10 represented languages – English, Dutch, French, Spanish, Italian, German, Portuguese, Greek, Swedish and Serbian. Nevertheless, creativity – the base, the building block of fashion - always comes up with new takes on existing concepts.

This means that any thesaurus, especially one on fashion, will need to be looked after and updated or become outdated. This is why we base our thesaurus on existing international standards, such as theGetty Research Institute’s Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT), and we strive to add new concepts in this existing structure where possible.

We aim to provide users with a myriad of search options, to help you find what you need, to keep you informed, interested and curious, and to help the fashion domain to publish its work. To find out more about the project, the thesaurus and the developments, please visit ourEuropeana Fashion projectwebsite.

The story of the first giraffe in Marseille

In 2013, Marseille celebrates its status as aEuropean Capital of Culture(along withKošice in Slovakia).

The idea behind the European Capital of Culture is to choose two cities each year, highlighting the richness and diversity of European cultures and celebrate the cultural ties that link Europeans together, bring people from different European countries into contact with each other's culture and promote mutual understanding, and to foster a feeling of European citizenship.

To celebrate, we've searched Europeana forcontent relating to Marseille- including the great story of Marseille's first giraffe!

And so, to the giraffe...

In 1826, Muhammad Ali of Egypt gave a giraffe as a gift to Charles X of France. On its way to Paris, the giraffe wintered in Marseille. In 1827, she walked the distance from Marseille to Paris.

'Trois fables sur la giraffe' is a booklet of three curious poems. It celebrates the joy and pride that the people of Marseille felt at hosting their first ever giraffe and marks the occasion of her leaving to go to Paris.

In the introduction, the author, Louis-François Jauffret, recounts that another gift of an Egyptian giraffe had been given to Florence in 1487. There, the giraffe took daily walks and ate apples from the hands of ladies who presented them from their balconies. Jauffret hopes that Paris will now enjoy the same experience as Florence and Marseille.

The first fable 'La giraffe' speaks of the author's astonishment at the arrival of the elegant giraffe and great respect for her onward journey to Paris.

In the second, 'La giraffe et l'antilope', the giraffe discusses the fashions of Paris with an antelope - will she fit in or be laughed at? Is her long neck something to ridicule? What will the weather be like - will it be much colder than Marseille? Reassured that she will be adored, the giraffe looks forward to making her entrance.

In the final poem, 'La giraffe et sa nourrice', the giraffe is compared by an academic to an ostrich. The giraffe takes offence and hopes that the ostrich is flattered.

Read the poemshere, and find out more about the giraffe's true storyhere.

Philosophy, oration and murder

January 3rd marks the anniversary of the birth in 106BC of a man we know as simply as Cicero.

Marcus Tullius Cicero was a Roman philosopher, statesman, lawyer, orator, political theorist, consul and constitutionalist. That's quite a CV!



'Portrait of Marcus Cicero', Wellcome Library, CC-BY-NC

Cicero's life story involves ancient Rome, the Caesars, a profound impact on Europeana literature, and murder.

According to author Michael Grant, 'the influence of Cicero upon the history of European literature and ideas greatly exceeds that of any other prose writer in any language.' His works rank among the most influential in European culture, and today still constitute one of the most important bodies of primary material for the writing and revision of Roman history, especially the last days of the Roman Republic.

Despite it occurring 1,500 years after his lifetime, the 14th century European Renaissance was inspired by Cicero.

His letters were discovered by Italian scholar and poet Petrarch. This rediscovery prompted the Renaissance, which some say was largely a revival of Cicero's ideologies.

Plenty of Cicero's work is available on Europeana.

BrowseCicero's texts,or try  philosophy and rhetoric with hisDe Oratore

Cicero became a prominent spokesman for the senate in Rome, as was Mark Antony.

Cicero spoke out in a series of speeches against Mark Antony, disliking the way he took liberties with Caesar's wishes and urging the senate to make him an enemy of the state. At the same time, Cicero spoke highly of another man, Octavian, Caesar's heir, in the hope that he would take over from Caesar when the time came.

But Cicero's plans to drive Antony out failed.

Antony and Octavian formed an alliance and in their turn named Cicero and his associates as enemies of the state. Cicero was caught on December 7th 43BC. He did not resist capture when the time came, and his head was cut off followed by his hands. Rather grimly, Antony's wife then supposedly tore out Cicero's tongue to avenge his power of speech.

Pieter de Hooch, baptised on this day, 20 December, in 1629, was a Dutch painter, famous principally for his depictions of the domestic life of women and children, and for his use of light. His work is related in theme and style to his contemporaries, the Dutch Golden Age great artists Jan Vermeer and  Nicolaes Maes. De Hooch began painting domestic scenes after he started his own family. He married Jannetje van der Burch in 1654 and the couple had five children. Before this stage in his life, de Hooch mainly focused on soldiers, stables and taverns.

The painting below is typical of de Hooch's work. Entitled 'Een vrouw met een kind in een kelderkamer' or 'A woman with a child in a basement room', it shows a mother and child with views into other rooms beyond them. The house's style and decor is typically 17th century Dutch  - look for the blue painted Delft tiles at the base of the wall behind the girl. It is quite possible that the woman, children and the rooms of the houses depicted are indeed his own wife and children and his own home.

In the next painting, de Hooch presents a woman performing what is called a 'Mother's Task' - that is, checking for head lice in her daughter's hair. Check out the Dutch box bed behind them - again, situating the scene firmly in the Netherlands. In this painting and the one above, you can see that a window or door in the room behind is open. This became a characteristic of his work - taking the viewer on a journey beyond the initial scene, encouraged by the lure of warm soft light and a wider world to discover.

The war diaries of the first female Italian newspaper editor

The memory of World War I, its events and consequences, its victims and victors, remains very much alive today. The stories of soldiers and their families continue to be told and published from generation to generation.

This blog from the Biblioteca nazionale centrale di Roma looks at one example of such storytelling: Matilde Serao'sParla una donna, a collection of articles relating to World War I.

Matilde Serao was a journalist and novelist. She was born in Greece, to an Italian father and Greek mother, moving to Italy when she was a child.

She was the first woman to edit an Italian newspaper, when she and her husband establishedIl Corriere di Roma. Together, they later founded and edited another newspaperIl Mattino, and, in 1904, her own newspaperIl Giorno.

Serao was the author of several novels, and was nominated for the Nobel Prize for Literature six times.

Parla una donna: diario femminile di guerra, maggio 1915-marzo 1916was published in 1916 by the the Milanese publisher Treves. It is a collection of articles by Matilde Serao which had been published at the beginning of the war in her newspaperIl Giorno.

The diary, dating from 25 May 1915 to March 1916, turned out to be a rare document, extremely interesting not only because the reader learns about the war through a female voice, but also crucially because this woman, writing about war, is actually writing about women.

As a reporter, Serao records a picture of the first months of war, observing how Italian women made their contribution.

Serao immediately points out that the book did not 'come out from the pen of an authoress: in it, a woman is talking'. A woman who is the mother of Antonio, Paolo and Vittorio: all three of her sons were called to arms, and to whom the book is dedicated.

As such, the book is addressed to women, called 'sisters', who, like Serao, prayed to God that 'the terrible bitter cup of war is taken away' from their lips and that will all be saved from the horrors of the war.

Matilde Serao wanted to make known the 'beauty of obscure heroism' and 'episodes of feminine virtue', among all social classes.

She particularly admires the women that work: peasant women that replace men in the fields, provincial women knitting wool stockings for soldiers, Italian women abroad, mothers, wives, and fiancées who have a smile on their face when they accompany the leaving soldiers and then live waiting to hear from them.

All these women, whose lives were transformed by the war, decided to silently sacrifice themselves - unlike many others that Serao calls 'female nits' ['nullità femminili'], who took advantage of the tragic moment to show off and give vent to their vanity.

However, the writer wonders who will appreciate these manifestations of feminine virtue, of daily courage: 'who will award a prize to this unknown value? God sees: but the world is blind'.

Matilde Serao gives herself her contribution: she reads to the mothers the letters of their sons at war, she visits the wounded soldiers in the hospitals and make them tell their stories, even if the soldiers prefer to tell the others’ deeds instead of theirs.

The author is driven by the will of collecting stories.

One such example is a time when, during one of her travels back from Rome to Naples, the train is full of officers with the greenish grey uniform of the Italian army. Serao speaks with some wounded soldiers and is struck, amongst them, by a pasty lieutenant that continually whispers 'If only I was injured…', complaining to go back home 'like a sissy' and not injured like his fellows, even if he had got hit by a grenade.

The diary ends with the waiting for spring that unfortunately will still be a season of war, but the Italian woman 'sees with her prophetic soul, beyond the season of tears and blood, the glow of peace'.

These words end the book and show the writer’s pacifism. Before the war, Matilde Serao made her newspaperIl Giornotook a neutral position - when the war begins, she deplores all its evil. WithParla una donna, she offers the positive examples of so many unknown women who, with commitment and humanity, gave their silent contribution in a moment of great difficulties.

Reports of the Censor of Indian Mails in France

The memory of World War I, its events and consequences, its victims and victors, remains very much alive today. It has become part of the individual and collective memory of Europe and of countries across the world - the stories of soldiers and their families continue to be told and published from generation to generation.

To mark the centenary of its outbreak in 2014, a consortium of national libraries and other partners from eight European countries that found themselves on different sides of the historic conflict will make an unparalleled collection of more than 400,000 digitised items relating to World War I freely available to
the public for the first time through the Europeana online portal.

As part of the Europeana Collections 1914-1918 project, the consortium members will publish a new blog post every month that looks at some of the stories
behind just a few of these 400,000 images.

This month, John O'Brien at the British Library has uncovered some poignant letters written by Indian troops stationed in France.

The British Library's India Office Records hold the Reports of the Censor of Indian Mails in France, 1914-1918.

The Censor was concerned with letters to and from Indian troops serving in France and Mesopotamia, and the reports include translated extracts from soldiers’ letters.

The Government feared that uncensored letters might provide military information to the enemy and that accounts of Indian soldiers suffering in France could distress their families at home, and so lead to political instability in India.

There was also a desire to prevent seditious material reaching the troops. The letters in this series passed through several layers of interpretation. As many Indian soldiers were illiterate, scribes took down the letter on the sender's behalf.

The letters were then censored at the Regimental level in order to remove military information. Lastly the letters were censored by the Censor's Office, based for most of the War in Boulogne. The chief purpose of this Office was not to suppress letters, but to gather information about the morale of the soldiers.

The Head Censor would prepare regular reports for the information of Government and the Army, and to which would be appended the translated extracts. Bound in 27 volumes, the letters describe vividly the experiences of the Indian soldiers, and their longing to return to their families back in India.

The letter from Daya Ram of the 2nd Lancers (British Library reference: IOR/L/MIL/5/826/6 f.876), dated 5 July 1916, describes the conditions the Indian troops lived in, with the sounds of battle all around, day and night, and the discomfort they suffered living in the trenches. Despite this, Daya Ram still notes how ‘splendidly built’ the dug-outs were, with wire beds and room enough to contain ‘many men at once’.





Being so far from India, and living in what must have seemed a very alien environment, many Indian soldiers naturally felt an acute longing for home and family.

The letter written by Gholam Rasul Khan of the Secunderbad Cavalry Brigade, on the 24th May 1916, to his father in Bihar, is a poignant example of this (British Library reference: IOR/L/MIL/5/826/5 f.711). In the letter, he says that a photo of the family is his most valuable possession, as it gives him comfort to look at it. Tellingly he comments that it is in the desire to see home and family that '…hundreds and thousands of men are daily sacrificing their lives'. Gholam's mood in the letter swings between hoping for that day and despairing that he will not live to see it.

Remember remember the fifth of November,Gunpowder, treason and plotI see no reason why gunpowder, treasonShould ever be forgot

A well-known rhyme taught to all children, and one I've known for many years. So, how did I forget it? Somehow, the fact that my all-time favourite night of the year was imminent slipped my mind and I made another commitment. A boring one - a committee meeting for a group I'm involved with. Usually I don't mind them - we discuss the always exciting future of a choir I sing with. But tonight, Monday 5th November, I will mind because while we're inside chatting about concerts and costumes, I'll be able to hear fireworks going off and smell the bonfires burning and I'll know I'm missing out on the night that marks the beginning of winter to me.

Children with sparklers on Bonfire Night

Those in the UK will know that tonight isBonfire NightorGuy Fawkes' Night. Others from elsewhere around the world might not know what this is. So let me tell you... Essentially, it is a night when families wrap up warm and venture out into the dark cold November night, stand as close as they can to a huge bonfire (which sometimes, although less often nowadays, has an effigy of a man on the top that is burned as the bonfire takes hold) and wait outside, shivering and waving sparklers, until it's time for a huge firework display. Then they look to the sky, exclaiming 'ooh' and 'aah' as what was dark fills with noise and light. Most communities hold a display at schools, in parks, at sports grounds, anywhere there's space for the pyrotechnics.

There might also be stalls selling mulled wine or hot cider, toffee apples and ginger cake, and often there are charity collections too. But why? To commemorate the fact that a man  calledGuy Fawkes(the one who you see getting burned on top of the bonfires) from York, England, tried to blow up London's Houses of Parliament in the Catholic rebellion's Gunpowder Plot of 1605. He was caught and the historic institution remained intact. Personally, I've never really understood why we celebrate the fact that something wasn't blown up by... blowing things up. But I love fireworks and mulled wine so I won't spend too long arguing about it!

So, in order to make me feel better for having to miss my favourite night of the year - here are some images from Europeana. First, a couple of political cartoons on the subject. And finally some good old-fashioned fireworks: a great watercolour of various pyrotechnics by J Lodge, and then some real-life explosions over the Millennium Bridge in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, UK. All together now: 'Ooh! Aah!'

How a satirical map depicts the state of European nations in 1914

The memory of World War I, its events and consequences, its victims and victors, remain very much alive today.

It has become part of the individual and collective memory of Europe and of countries across the world. In this blog, the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin highlight a remarkable piece from itsWorld War Icollection: a satirical map of the nations of Europe as seen in 1914.

While buck-toothed England looks grumpy - with Ireland growling at its back - she still hesitates to mobilise its fleet. France is being put to flight by a single swift kick, while Italy watches the scene rejoicing, its hands in its pockets; whereas a giant Russian soldier is trying to swallow the European antagonists whole. The Germans and Austrians, however, are firing in all directions, their bayonet getting up the Russian’s nose, or aimed his throat.

All this and more can be seen on the satirical map of Europe in 1914 drawn by the German graphic artist Walter Trier (1890-1951), mainly known for his illustrations of Erich Kästner’s famous storyEmil and the Detectives(1929).

Trier was Jewish, and a collaborator on left-wing satirical journals. He had to flee Berlin for London in 1936. During World War II, he provided the British Ministry of Information with anti-Nazi drawings for political propaganda leaflets.

Today we explore the dramatic life story of the Baroque artistMichelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio- who was born on 29 September 1571.

Here are five things that you might not know about Caravaggio:

The Baroque style, which used exaggerated motion and clear, easily interpreted detail to produce drama and grandeur, was encouraged by the Roman Catholic Church, which wanted the arts to convey religious themes and encourage direct emotional involvement. Did the movement’s  emphasis on exaggeration, emotion and drama stoke the fire of Carvaggio’s violence? Or did the existence of a vicious temperament lead the man to be a great artist, second only to Michelangelo in terms of Italian art influence?

One thing is clear - his experience of real-life horrors and a dispensation for violence is borne out in his work. His commissions included religious works featuring ‘violent struggles, grotesque decapitations, torture and death’ (Caravaggio Foundation).

Despite a relatively short career - he died at the age of 38 – Caravaggio’s work had a huge influence on the younger artists in Rome at the time. ‘Caravaggism’ became a new style followed by a school of painters termed the ‘Caravaggisti’. Pockets of Caravaggisti sprang up in Rome, Naples and the Utrecht (characteristics of his work can be seen in paintings by Rubens, Vermeer, Rembrandt and Velázquez) but were largely short-lived. It was not until the 20th century that the significance of Caravaggio’s work to Western art was widely acknowledged.

What architecture styles are associated with Borromini?

What is the difference between Bernini and Borromini?

How did Francesco Borromini die?

Francesco Borromini was a brilliant, and troubled, architect of the Baroque era in Rome

Greatness, illusion, bitter rivalry, and a tragic end. It's a life story that could easily have been penned for a Hollywood epic drama. Today we are celebratingFrancesco Borromini, born on this day in 1599.

Born with the name Francesco Castelli, Borromini was a Swiss Italian architect and a prominent figure in the emergence of Roman Baroque architecture.

Daring, imaginative, licentious, idiosyncratic and extravagant – just some of the words used to describe Borromini's personality and style. He was influenced by the architecture of Michelangelo and the ruins of Antiquity.

His architecture employs manipulations of classical architectural forms, geometrical rationales with symbolic meanings behind his buildings.

Borromini began working at the Palazzo Spada in Rome in 1632. His work here culminated in 1652-3 with thePerspective Gallery.

This is an example of ‘forced perspective’ and shows what the Encyclopedia of World Biography calls an ‘unexpected wit that must have helped to make Borromini's name known.’ The corridor is shorter and the sculpture at its end much smaller than they first appear. The corridor looks to be around 35m long, when in fact it is less than 9m from front to back.



Sketches of Borromini's Perspective Gallery by JJ Lequeu, French National Library, Public Domain

Borromini wasn't the only architect to dominate the early 17th century - the other prominent figure of the time wasGian Lorenzo Bernini, whose works were more traditional and classical.

Bernini was safe and sober while Borromini took risks and experimented.

Their backgrounds differed too; while Borromini was learning his trade as a humble stone mason and craftsman, Bernini was perfecting the higher art of sculpture.

It is thought that this was the seed of their bitter rivalry, which grew in the 1630s when Borromini worked under Bernini at St. Peter's and the Palazzo Barberini in Rome. Some historians think that this bitter rivalry may ultimately have led to Borromini’s tragic death.

Borromini was honoured by the Pope in 1652 and made a knight of Christ. In his career, although his work provoked dispute and discussion, he became successful and an important figure in baroque architecture.

Despite this, it seems that Borromini was troubled, described as 'neurotic' and perfectionist, and maintained a bitterness towards Bernini's greater fame.

In the last few days of his life in 1667, he  was extremely agitated and is thought to have destroyed many of his drawings. In August 1667, he was under the watchful eye of a servant at all times because he was suffering from a nervous complaint.

Seizing the opportunity when his guardian was distracted, Borromini stabbed himself with his own sword. In the time left to him, he recovered enough to make his will and receive the last rites before he died.

This tragedy was compounded by Borromini leaving a significant work unfinished -  a collection of engravings of his buildings begun shortly before his death. These were published some 60 years later asOpus architectonicum equitis Francisci Boromini.

A remarkable story from World War One

The memory of World War I, its events and consequences, its victims and victors, remains very much alive today. It has become part of the individual and collective memory of Europe and of countries across the world – the stories of soldiers and their families continue to be told and published from generation to generation.

To mark the centenary of its outbreak in 2014, a consortium of national libraries and other partners from eight European countries that found themselves on different sides of the historic conflict made an unparalleled collection of more than 400,000 digitised items relating to World War I freely available to the public for the first time through Europeana.

As part ofthis project, the consortium members add a new blog post every month that looks at some of the stories behind just a few of these 400,000 images, starting with wonderful sketches and stories from a Serbian War Artist from the collections of the National Library of Serbia.

The National Library of Serbia is proud to present a remarkable piece from its World War One collection: a small, but powerful, story from amongst the material that we are digitising for the Europeana Collections 1914-18 project.



The three wonderful texts below are a compilation of writing accompanying sketches for future paintings by one of the official war artists of the Serbian army, Miodrag Petrović.

The artist was born in 1888 in the Kingdom of Serbia, where he began his art studies. Later on, he studied at the Arts Academy in Munich, Germany, until the beginning of the World War I.

After enlisting in the Serbian army, he was granted the status of the official military artist. He took part in the battles around Belgrade in 1914, and was part of the retreat with the army through Montenegro and Albania to the Greek island of Corfu during the winter of 1915. By the end of the war, he was stationed on the Salonika front, and in field hospitals in Tunisia and Algeria.

After the war Miodrag Petrović continued his art studies in Paris and enjoyed an accomplished and eminent artistic career. He died in 1950 in Belgrade.

'The hospital shipDivonais transporting our wounded soldiers and officers, as well as the sick ones, to Bizerte. During our voyage on the Mediterranean sea, two of our soldiers have died. A wounded and a sick one. At eight o’clock in the evening they throw the two into the sea by moonlight.'



'Eight o’clock in the evening. The sky is clear, the moon is full. In the back part of the ship a two metre wide fence has been errected. At the very edge of the ship, with heads turned towards the ship and the legs towards the sea, the corpses are lying, both of them covered with the French flag. The colour red is near the sea, the white and blue away from it. The sea is of a dark greenish-blue colour. The sky is of the same colour – only brighter because of the moon, which cannot really be seen in the picture, but by its long reflection on the water. Its beams reaching the ship disperse into a thousand particles. The light bulbs are turned off in the back portion of the ship. There is only one shining on the right hand side. The ceremony begins. The ship’s (Protestant) priest in his black gown with a stole is turned toward the corpses and the sea. He is reading from the Bible in a low voice, almost silently.'

'Behind him there is the captain of the ship in a solemn, completely black uniform, bareheaded. To the left of him is another French officer and two ours, wounded in the arms. All of them bareheaded. There are two sailors to the right and two to the left of the corpses, all completely dressed in white, with caps on their heads (the sailors with blue around the head, a white mane, and a red tuft). Behind them, on both sides, our wounded and sick soldiers and two nurses all in white, with the Red Cross around their arms. The entire picture is illuminated by the bulb from the right, and the pale greenish-yellow light of the moon. The ship is white. The faces of all are solemn, sad. The priest is silently ending his prayer. The nurses are also whispering the Lord’s Prayer. “I’ve finished,” says the priest, turning to the captain and closing the Bible, and steps back.'

'The captain gives a sign that the motion be stopped. He approaches the corpses and makes a short speech: “Comrades, far from your homeland you breathed your last on the brotherly French boat. Go to the other world confident that your children, wives and parents will very soon live in freedom, in which you could not live. Farewell, comrades. Farewell. Farewell.” The captain ends the speech, and gives a sign that they be dropped. Two sailors come and lift one part of the board, and one of the corpses vanishes into the sea (there are 30 kilograms of iron attached to his legs). So does the other one. During the corpse’s fall into the water, one of the sailors blows loudly on a whistle. Our soldiers are quiet for no less than five minutes. They are silently looking at each other, the soldiers who buried so many comrades, who were wounded several times, who saw thousands of corpses; now this has such an impact on them that they are not able to utter a word.'



'Under an orange tree that has borne fruit plentifully, so that the branches are banding with yellow oranges, our soldier is sitting, with his coat taken off, removing lice from himself. Intoxicated by the smell of the orange whose peel is lying next to him, and enchanted with the blue sky and the greenish blue surface of the sea, upon which a colorful boat is rolling, while across the water one can see the Albanian coast, whose docks are covered with snow, he has itches; and in order that trifles should not bother him in these vast expanses, he takes off his coat- searching for prose so that it shouldn’t distract him from poetry.'



The boat was torpedoed by German submarines. Loaded with soldiers sailing from Bizerte in Africa to the Salonika Front, it sank. Some of the soldiers drowned, while some were saved by an English boat. Four of them, a Serb, a Senegalese, a French sailor and a foot soldier have saved themselves on a raft made from thick planks (which can be found in the upper part of any boat), clad in rags, starving, bluish through cold and thirst, in soldier’s summer tunics. They see a rocky coast in the distance. With happy faces, though exhausted, they are trying to paddle with their legs, using their last strength.



About a hundred metres from the coast the sea gets disturbed, and out of it emerge nymphs, Nereids, who surround the raft and start to pull it toward the coast, giggling hysterically. Others come out of the sea and go toward the rocks, laughing. The victims are pale, scared, confused. One of them is praying to God. He has saved himself on the solitary rocky island. He is alone with a nymph: the Serbian soldier, in torn summer clothes, with no shoes, sitting on a rock, with his look wandering toward the homeland, toward Serbia, and the nymph, standing behind him, playing a harp made of wood and singing cheerful melodies so as to cheer him up a little. The sea is calm, the day is clear. In the rocks behind there is a cave."

Санитетска лађаДивонапревози наше рањене војнике и официре, као и болесне, за Бизерт. За време вожње на Средоземном мору умиру два наша војника. Један рањеник и болесник. У осми час увече по месечини бацају обојицу у море. Осми час увече. Небо јасно, пун месец. На задњем делу лађе дигнута ограда у ширини око два метра. На саму ивицу лађе, тако да је глава окренута лађи, а ноге ка мору, положени лешеви. Оба леша покривена француском заставом. Црвена боја ка мору, бела на плаву ка лађи. Море затворено плаво-зелене боје. Небо исто – само отвореније, од месеца, који се на самој слици не види, пао дуги рефлекс по води. Крајњи зраци који додирују саму лађу разбијају се у хиљаду делића. На лађи у задњем делу угашене сијалице. Само остављена једна са десне стране. Свечаност почиње. Свештеник саме лађе (протестант) у црној ризи са петрахилом, окренут лешевима и мору. Чита јеванђеље тихо, готово у себи. Позади њега стоји капетан лађе у потпуно црном – свечаној униформи, гологлав. До њега, са леве стране, стоји још један француски официр, и два наша, рањена у рује. Сви гологлави.

Са десне и леве стране лешева по два матроза у потпуно белом оделу са капама на глави (матроским плавим око главе, белом гривом и црвеном ћубом). Са обе стране иза њих наши рањени и болесни војници и две милосрдне сестре све у белом, са црвеним крстовима око руке. Целу слику осветљава сијалица са десне стране и бледа зеленкастожута светлост месеца. Лађа обојена бело. Лица свих свечана, тужна.. Свештеник довршава тихо своју молитву. Милостиве сестре такође шапћући читају Оченаш. „Свршио сам, извол’те“, рече свештеник, окрећући се капетану и затварајући Свето писмо, и одступи назада. Капетан да знак да се точак заустави. Приђе лешевима и кратко изговори: „Другови, далеко од своје отаджбине испустисте душе на братском француском борду. Пођите са уверењем на онај свет да ће ваша деца, жене и родитељи за кратко време дочекати слободу, коју ви нисте могли дочекати. Збогом, другови. Збогом. Збогом.“ Заврши капетан и руком да знак за спуштање. Са стране два матроза приђоше, дигоше један крај даске, и леш слете у море (за ноге му је привезано 30 килограма гвожђа). Тако и други. За време док леш дижу и пада ка води, један од матроза пишти јако у пиштаљку. Наши војници осташе запрепашћени читавих пет минута. Немо се погледаше. Војници који су масу својих другова закопали, били рањавани по неколико пута, гледали хиљадама лешева, сад нису умели да дођу до речи – толико је то на њих страшно дејствовало.

Проза и поезија Под поморанџиним дрветом које је обилно родило, тако да се гране повијају од жутих поморанџи, сео наш трећепозивац, скинуо капоран и треби се од вашију. Опијен мирисом поморанџе чије коре леже поред њега, очаран плавим небом и зеленкасто-плавом површином мора, по коме се лелуја шарена барка, а преко мора се види албанска обала, чије докове покрива снег, осећа да га нешто сврби. И да му ситне ствари не би досађивале у великим просторима, скину капоран, тражећи прозу да му не би досађивала у поезији. Нови Одисеј (Улис) Лађа је торпедована од немачких сумарена. Велика натоварена људствост, војницима који из Бизерта, Африке, иду за Солунски фронт, потпнула. Неки су се од војника подавили, неке је спасио енглески тарпинер. Њих четворица – Србин, Сенегалац, француски маринац и пешак – спасли су се на једном сплаву направљеном од дебелих дасака (од којих свака лађа има на крову), исцепани, изгладнели, помодрели ид зиме и жеђи, у лаким летњим војничким блузама. У даљини се види каменита обала. Весала лица, иако уморни, покушавају да ногама веслају прикупљајући и последњу снагу. До саме обале на сто метара вода се узбурка и из ње искочише нимфе – нерајаиде, опколише сплав и у хистеричном кикоту почеше га вући ка обали. Друге искочише из мора ка камењу и смеју се. Страдалници бледи, уплашени, збуњени. Један се моли Богу. Спасао се на усамљено острво каменито. Он сам и нимфа. Српски војник, у подерано летњем оделу, без ципела, сео на стену и сањалачким погледом блуди пут отаџбине – Србије. Нимфа у харфу, направљеној од дрвета, више њега стојећи, свира и пева веселе арије не би ли му мисли ма колико развеселила. Море мирно, дан јасан. Позади у камењару пећина.

William 'Count' Basie is considered one of the most influential jazz musicians in history

Today would be the birthday of Count Basie - American jazz pianist, organist, bandleader, and composer. William 'Count' Basie is considered one of the most influential jazz musicians in history.



Did you know? Count Basie's playing was much more relaxed than a lot of other swing piano players. He actually played fewer notes than his contemporaries! And his most famous single,One O'Clock Jump, from 1935, was composed when Basie and his band were just messing around. More Basie factshere. To see and hear Count Basie, take a look at thisvideofrom the Institut National de l'Audiovisuel - commemorating his life and broadcast at the time of his death in 1984.

To celebrate this great swing pianist, I've found some real gems of pianos in Europeana.

If you're a pianist (and I am), just looking at them will make your fingers tingle for a touch of the ivories. And whether you play or not, you can explore a whole range ofjazzmusic on Europeana - it's not all about the paintings, you know!

The first piano I'd like to show you is a square pianoforte from 1840. Who'd have thought a descendant of this sedate instrument would end up being one of the great tools for a genre described by some as 'the devil's music'?



I'm including  this next piano because it's just so beautiful. It's a giraffe piano, so-called because of its long graceful neck.



If you've never looked inside a piano - here's what you'd see if you did. This is a typical upright piano you'd find in a family home, school or church hall. 88 keys, two pedals (one to sustain the sound and one to soften it). When you press a key, a felt-covered hammer hits the appropriate steel string.



And finally, the pièce de resistance, the grand piano. My ambition is to own one of these beauties. And this one is a particularly nice one, it's by John Broadwood and Sons, made of rosewood and rented, for a time in 1849, to Lord Breadalbane, a member of the Scottish aristocracy.



And this is me, playing the piano. OK, no it's not, but it's a rather nice poster by Maurice Biais for Erard's piano makers.

Father of chemistry

On 20 August 1779, a boy was born without whom I couldn't have written and shared this blog post. His name was Jöns Jacob Berzelius and he's considered as one of the fathers of modern chemistry.

Jacob's parents died when he was young so he was raised by relatives in Linköping, Sweden, where he attended the Cathedral School. In 1796, he went to Uppsala University to become a doctor of medicine.

After graduating he worked for a while in Stockholm as a doctor. Industrialist Wilhelm Hisinger noticed his analytical abilities and sponsored him with a laboratory. His house-keeper Anna Sundström managed the lab and, in time, she was to become the first female chemist in Sweden!

So why couldn't I have blogged this without Berzelius?

During his career Berzelius discovered many elements. One of those elements, which he discovered and isolated in 1824 and called Silicium, which today is known asSilicon.

The uses of silicon are many, but perhaps most fundamental for our age is its use insemiconductors and integrated circuitsand which forms the tiny building blocks of the processor powering the computer on which I write this blog post.

As befitting a 'father of chemistry', many of his books and letters are available in Europeana.

You can catch a sample below orget a list of all of them here. By the way, there are three other 19th century chemists who are also considered fathers of modern chemistry - do you know their names?

Napoleon Bonaparte was much caricatured

Today marks the anniversary of the birth of Napoleon Bonaparte. To commemorate this occasion, we've searched Europeana forBonaparte-related contentand happened across a number of fascinating cartoons. It's the political satire of its time, as clever and punchy as the TV panel shows that do the same job today.

Born in 1769, in Corsica, Napoleon was a French military and political leader who rose to prominence during the latter stages of the French Revolution and its associated wars in Europe. He became Emperor of the French from 1804 to 1815. In the first decade of the 19th century, the French Empire under Napoleon engaged in a series of conflicts—the Napoleonic Wars—that involved every major European power. After experiencing great political and military successes, Napoleon's army suffered some significant defeats, such as the Peninsula War and the 1812 French invasion of Russia.

In 1813, Napoleon abdicated and exiled himself to the island of Elba. Less than a year later, he escaped Elba and returned to power, but was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815. Napoleon spent the last six years of his life in confinement by the British on the island of Saint Helena, eventually dying of stomach cancer, or arsenic poisoning if you're a conspiracy theorist. So, to the cartoons.

First of all, compare these two portraits. In the first, bold and active at the Battle of Arcole (c.1798-1805); in the secod, plump and wistful exiled on the island of St Helena in 1816.





Here, Napoleon touches one of his own soldiers suffering from bubonic plague at Jaffa in March 1799. The reason? To show he doesn't fear it, in order to prevent widespread panic. And yet, two months later, he orders all infected soldiers to be poisoned.



Here, celebrating the Treaty of Amiens in  1802, Napoleon provides the music and other countries dance...



In the next cartoon, Napoleon brings the New World to the island of Elba. In spite of bringing with him the instruments of architects and builders, a welcoming peasant is unconvinced.



Our final three cartoons are symbolic of Napoleon's fate - captured and exiled. Here we see him trapped in a bottle, a cage and in a sketch titled 'At his post of honour' - the hangman's post.

Musée du Louvrefirst opened its doors to the public on this day in 1793, hosting an exhibition of 537 paintings, the majority of the works being royal and confiscated church property. Before its birth as a museum, the Louvre was a royal palace for more than two centuries. Today the historic landmark in central Paris is one of the most visited museums with one of the richest collections in the world, representing artwork and artefacts from 11,000 years of human civilisation and culture. Over 23,000 items from the Louvre collection areavailable through Europeanaand can be accessed via the the portal.









To accommodate a rapidly growing collection, the museum was extended on a number of occasions throughout history; many of the extensions aredocumented in Europeanathrough etchings, plans and photographs. The collection increased significantly underNapoleonand the museum was renamed the Musée Napoléon. After the defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo, many works seized by his armies were returned to their original owners.

The collection was further increased during the reigns ofLouis XVIIIand Charles X, and during the Second French Empire the museum gained 20,000 pieces. Holdings have grown steadily through donations and gifts since the Third Republic.

Looking forward into the 21st century, the museum plans to open satellite museums in the city of Lens in northern France and Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. The art will come from multiple museums, including the Louvre, the Georges Pompidou Centre, the Musée d'Orsay, Versailles, the Musée Guimet, the Musée Rodin, and the Musée du quai Branly. Both Museums are expected to be completed this year.

Ear ache? Sore throat? Tooth ache? If you’re suffering these symptoms, it's possible you'd benefit from a dose of penicillin.

And if that’s the case, you should be raising a glass to Sir Alexander Fleming, who discovered the popular antibiotic. He was born on 6 August 1881 in the small town of Darvel, Scotland.

Penicillin is a naturally occurring substance, which is why we credit Fleming withdiscoveringrather thaninventingit. And to be absolutely correct, he re-discovered it three decades after a French medical student first made note of it. And, what’s more, the discovery came after Fleming left a petri dish out in the lab by accident!

In 1928, Fleming noticed that a blue-green mould had contaminated another specimen in the lab (the unwashed petri dish) and that bacteria on the dish were being dissolved.

He experimented with the mould and found that it killed a number of disease-causing bacteria. He named it penicillin and published his findings in 1929.

Despite this great discovery, penicillin wasn’t widely used straightaway.

After undergoing clinical trials in 1943, it was first used on a large scale during World War Two to treat soldiers wounded on D-Day. It wasn’t until 1948 that Andrew J Moyer, one of the scientists responsible for this progress, was granted a patent for a method for penicillin mass production.

Needless to say, the significance of penicillin was soon recognised. In 1945, theNobel Prizein Physiology or Medicine was awarded jointly to Sir Alexander Fleming, Ernst Boris Chain and Sir Howard Walter Florey, 'for the discovery of penicillin and its curative effect in various infectious diseases'.

Early production of penicillin wasn’t exactly what we would call hi-tech – check out this photo of some equipment used. Yes, they’re old milk churns!

As is its way, nature always fights back, and only four years after drug companies began mass-producing penicillin, microbes that were resistant to it began appearing. Because of this growing resistance, penicillin is now less useful than it once was. Scientists continue to modify it and other antibiotics to try to keep one step ahead of the bugs and to keep us healthy.

Other discoveries thought to have come about by accident include: brandy – a side-effect of using distillation to make wine easier to transport; Teflon – an accidental chemical reaction when trying to make a new CFC; crisps (potato chips) – the result of a fed-up chef trying to outwit a complaining customer; and Viagra - its potent power was discovered when the drug was tested for its treatment of angina.

How did John Tyndall explain why the sky is blue?

What scientific experiments did John Tyndall do?

John Tyndall was one of the 19th century's most important scientists

The brightest flashes in the world of thought are incomplete until they have been proven to have their counterparts in the world of fact.John Tyndall

Today we are celebrating the birth of one of the most important scientists and educators of the 19th century,John Tyndall.

The Irish physicist was born on this day in 1820. He is remembered by many as the man who first explained why the sky is blue.

This discovery, known as the Tyndall effect, proves the sky’s blue colour results from the scattering of the sun’s rays by molecules in the atmosphere.

Tyndall's major scientific contributions were in physical chemistry, initially with the study of diamagnetism, and then thermal radiation – producing a number of discoveries in atmospheric processes. His experimental physics and resulting discoveries were brought to a wider audience through the publication of seventeen books during the 19th century.

Other major experiments from Tyndall include the transmission of both radiant heat and light through various gases and vapours.

Tyndall discovered that water vapour absorbs much more radiant heat than the gases of the atmosphere and argued the consequent importance of atmospheric water vapour in moderating the Earth’s climate—that is, in the natural greenhouse effect.

He is also credited with the first ever atmospheric pollution measurements using infra-red and scattering measurement instruments, showing that ozone, the upper layer of atmosphere, is vital to life on Earth, and it is an oxygen cluster rather than a hydrogen compound.

Tyndall laid significant groundwork in physics for magnetism, electricity, molecular physics, optics, sound, the properties of materials, diamagnetism and heat.

What name did Emily Brontë write under?

What inspired Emily Brontë'sWuthering Heights?

Who was Emily Brontë and what inspired her writing?

Emily Brontë, author of the classic novelWuthering Heightswas born on this day in 1818.

Emily was the third eldest of the four surviving Brontë siblings. Sisters Charlotte, Emily and Anne were all writers. Not many images of the family remain with us - indeed, there is some disagreement as to whether the portrait above shows Emily or Anne.

Their first volume of poems was published under the pseudonyms Currer Bell, Ellis Bell and Acton Bell.

Their true identities remained a secret until after novelsJane Eyreby Charlotte,Agnes Greyby Anne andWuthering Heightsby Emily had been published, by which time speculation and rumour were rife.

On Europeana, you can find Emily Jane Brontë's entry in the local baptismal register.

The register shows that she was baptised on 20 August 1818, daughter of the Reverend Patrick Brontë , Minister of Thornton, and Maria Brontë.

Emily died of tuberculosis, on 19 December 1848 aged just 30. She was interred in the Church of St. Michael and All Angels family vault, Haworth, West Yorkshire.

Wuthering Heightsis Emily Bronte's great novel, which has resonated through centuries and inspired many more artists.

It is known for its descriptions of the wild, romantic and untamed scenery of the Yorkshire Moors as well as the passionate love story at its centre.

The French translation above gives the novel the titleUn Amant('A Lover') while the German titleSturmhöhetranslates as 'Storm heights' and a Spanish titleCumbres Borrascosasalso references blustery or stormy uplands.

Sales ofWuthering Heightsquadrupled in 2009 because of a reference made to it by lead character Bella in the hugely popular teen vampire series,Twilight, by Stephanie Meyer.

To transport yourself to this symbolic and inspiring landscape, take a look at some images of Haworth and have someone read out the following excerpts from Emily's novel to you.

From Chapter 10 :

'They sat together in a window whose lattice lay back against the wall, and displayed, beyond the garden trees, and the wild green park, the valley of Gimmerton, with a long line of mist winding nearly to its top (for very soon after you pass the chapel, as you may have noticed, the sough that runs from the marshes joins a beck which follows the bend of the glen). Wuthering Heights rose above this silvery vapour; but our old house was invisible; it rather dips down on the other side.'

From Chapter 18:

'The abrupt descent of Penistone Crags particularly attracted her notice; especially when the setting sun shone on it and the topmost heights, and the whole extent of landscape besides lay in shadow. I explained that they were bare masses of stone, with hardly enough earth in their clefts to nourish a stunted tree. From Chapter 34: I lingered round them [the gravestones], under that benign sky: watched the moths fluttering among the heath and harebells, listened to the soft wind breathing through the grass, and wondered how any one could ever imagine unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth.'

--------------------------------------------------

On 24 July 1802, Alexandre Dumas, the writer of classic adventure novelsThe Count of Monte CristoandThe Three Musketeerswas born. Dumas was the grandson of a French nobleman and an enslaved woman from Haiti, and was born into poverty.

Dumas began his writing career with magazine articles and plays that went on to achieve great success. Later, he progressed to novels which were published as popular newspaper serials.

His most famous works were collaborative projects with Auguste Maquet, who outlined the plot forThe Count of Monte Cristoand made substantial contributions toThe Three Musketeers. Dumas's writing earned him a great deal of money, but he was frequently insolvent as a result of spending lavishly on sumptuous living.

Europeana holds a range of items relating to Alexandre Dumas. You can read a range of his personalletters.

You can also hear Dumas' memories in his own words in avideo from the French Institut National de l'Audiovisuel. In the clip, Pierre Arditi reads two extracts from Dumas'sMes mémoiresto commemorate the relocation of Dumas' body on 30 November 2002.

Despite Alexandre Dumas' success and aristocratic background, his being of mixed race affected him all his life.

In 2002, French President Jacques Chirac ordered that Dumas' body be exhumed from its place in the family plot in Villers-Cotterêts and moved to the Panthéon of Paris. In a speech, Chirac acknowledged the racism that had existed, saying that a wrong had now been righted, with Alexandre Dumas enshrined alongside fellow authors Victor Hugo and Emile Zola.

The honour recognised that although France has produced many great writers, none has been so widely read as Alexandre Dumas. His stories have been translated into almost a hundred languages, and have inspired more than 200 motion pictures.

Is there still a place for handwritten diaries in this world of social media?

Today, 6th July, marks the 70th anniversary ofAnne Frank’sfamily going into hiding in their Secret Annex at 263Prinsengracht, Amsterdam. 13-year-old Anne had been writing her now-famous diary for less than a month. Her work, which has sold over 31 million copies and been translated into more than 65 languages, is a moving account of life for a Jewish family in hiding in the Second World War.

Anne wrote the diary for herself, but in 1944, Gerrit Bolkestein, a member of the Dutch government in exile, announced his wish to collect eyewitness accounts of the Dutch people under the German occupation. Anne decided that when the war was over a book based on her diary should be published. As the enduring nature of Anne’s diary shows, the recording and preservation of people’s life experiences is important. Europeana’s ownWorld War 1road shows have brought several other war diaries to light, two examples of which are below.

First page of William Monk's Diary, available under aCreative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License

William Monk’s‘A Short Diary Of The Club Land in 1917’, describes Clayton-Le-Moors Working Men’s Club’s allotment in Preston, England, which was established because ‘the government warned the people of the importance and necessity of the cultivation of all available land in the country’. The journal charts both the challenges of running a group allotment, and the progress of the vegetables, describing, for example, how a snow storm hampered potato sowing, and how bean plants had to be sprayed at midnight in the moonlight.



George Lowe's diary entries for 6-8 November 1917, available under aCreative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

George Lowekept a handwritten diary from November 1917 to May 1918, when he was assigned to a siege battery. The journal begins: ‘I recd this book on 5/11/17. I had already made 2 different attempts to keep a short diary but always neglected them. So I will start from the above date in earnest.’ Just two days later, George writes ‘Had a narrow shave with one of Jerry’s shells, he fairly shook us up.’ The very impulse that drives people to keep diaries is that which makes them valuable to future generations - to record an existence which, particularly in times of war, we realise is only too fleeting.

There are manydiariesavailable in Europeana, some dating as far back as the11th century. Each of them provides us with a view of a bygone time, in the words of those who saw it for themselves. What would the authors of these decades-old, or indeed centuries-old diaries, think if they knew they could be read by millions in the 21st century? Is there still a place for handwritten diaries in this world of online blogs, shared digital calendars and social media? It is now common practice to publish our thoughts and feelings to a global public instantly. Is the age of the diary over?

The story of the oldest tennis tournament in the world

Wimbledon is the oldest tennis tournament in the world started in 1877 and is considered by many as the most prestigious. It is one of the major Grand Slams, the other three Majors being the Australian Open, French Open and US Open. Wimbledon is the only Major still played on grass, the game's original surface, which gave the game of lawn tennis its name.

The two week tournament traditionally takes place in late June and ends in early July with the Ladies' and Gentlemen's Singles Final, scheduled respectively for the second Saturday and Sunday. Wimbledon traditions include a strict dress code for competitors, the eating of strawberries and cream by the spectators, and Royal patronage.

New Yorkers love it when you spill your guts out there. Spill your guts at Wimbledon and they make you stop and clean it up.

Jimmy Connors (Gentlemen's Singles champion in 1974)

Matches in the Gentlemen's Singles and Gentlemen's Doubles competitions are best-of-five sets. Matches in all other events are best-of-three sets. A total of 128 players feature in each singles event, 64 pairs in each single-sex doubles event, and 48 pairs in Mixed Doubles. Players and doubles pairs are admitted to the main events on the basis of their international rankings, with consideration also given to their previous performances at grass court events.

Kathleen McKane Godfree won Wimbledon singles and mixed doubles in 1924 and 1926.

Marking the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II

This year is the diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II, marking sixty years as the Constitutional Monarch of the United Kingdom of Great Britian and Northern Ireland,  together with 16 Commonwealth realms. Since her coronation in 1952 she has witnessed the ongoing transformation of the British Empire into the Commonwealth of Nations, representing fifty four independent member states.

“I cannot lead you into battle. I do not give you laws or administer justice but I can do something else - I can give my heart and my devotion to these old islands and to all the peoples of ourbrotherhood of nations.”- Queen Elizabeth II

Upon the death of her father, King George VI, on 6 February 1952, Queen Elizabeth II acquired the thrones of seven countries. She is today queen regnant of sixteen sovereign states, twelve of which were British colonies or Dominions at the start of her reign. Queen Victoria is the only other monarch in the histories of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and a number of other Commonwealth realms to have a celebrated a Diamond Jubilee, in 1897.

Artspace - Hack4Europe Warsaw

europ.in - Hack4Europe Riga

Stackathon - Hack4Europe Leuven

During 2012, and as part of the "Connecting Society to Culture Programme", Europeana invited developers and designers to demonstrate the possibilities of using theEuropeana APIto develop marketable applications.

TheHack4Europe-competitionwaslaunched by EU Vice-Presidentand Commissioner for the Digital Agenda for Europe Neelie Kroes on May 9.

At hackathons in Warzaw, Riga and Leuven developers have had access to the Europeana API and through it to the more than 23 million records in Europeana.

At each hackathon juries have selected winners in three categories:

Greatest commercial potential
Greatest social impact
Most innovative.

At each hackathon, the participating developers have also voted on the Developer's Pick award.

The Europeana jury have then finally selected three winning applications and teams from each hackathon to showcase at theDigital Agenda Assemblyin Brussels.

Below you can get a preview of and more information about these three prototypes.

In total 22 prototypes were developed and in the next days we will add information and links about them all on theHack4Europe-pages.

Concept for Artspace

Artspaceaims to promote Europeana collections and release them into the public space to places such as coffeshops, libraries, schools, hotels, clubs, etc. LCD displays and a Collection Management System available online allow a “Virtual art leasing” service and a highly personalized curation.

The project combines Europeana with external resources, facilitating access to art in everyday situations and encouraging interaction through mobile and social features.

Artspace was developed by Agata Dziekan and Marek Średniawa.

Paintings by Louis Jacques David in Europ.in

Europ.inmakes searching, navigating and sharing Europeana content more fun.

Starting with a simple search the results are displayed in a highly engaging visual manner. Users of Europ.in can then easily use the search results to navigate further or to get the details about an individual record.

Europ.in was developed by Ēriks Remess, Maksim Berjoza and Uldis Bojars.

Personally curated and audio annotated artwork in Stackathon

Stackathonis a mobile application that allows users to search and select artworks in Europeana.

The user can then, using the phone itself as a recording device, add audio comments to the selected artwork. The audio annotated artworks can then be shared online. In this way, personal guides to art or art critiques can be created and shared.

Stackathon was developed by Senne Van Den Bogaert, Mehmet Celik and Wouter Aerts.

American artist and prominent social activist Keith Haring

'I'd like to pretend that I've never seen anything, never read anything, never heard anything... and then make something...'- Keith Haring

Renowned American artist and prominent social activistKeith Haringwas born on May 4 1958.

As the son of an amateur cartoonist, from an early age, Keith Haring was interested in visual art.

He moved to New York City at the age of 19 and first drew public attention with chalk drawings in the subways of the city.

Artworks with bold lines, vivid colours and active figures soon became his signature style.

Through the 1980s, Haring's artistic career grew with many projects around the world, including Europe.

His first international art show came in 1982, featuring in documenta, an exhibition for contemporary art taking place every five years in Kassel, Germany.

In spring 1986, Keith Haring's first solo museum exhibition took place at theStedelijk Museum in Amsterdam.

Haring designed and painted murals for museums in, amongst others, Bordeaux, Amsterdam and Berlin. He created a mural for the Necker Children's Hospital in Paris, as well as many others in public spaces across Europe.

Haring was gay, with his work often reflecting socio-political themes.

After being diagnosed with AIDS in 1988, he established theKeith Haring Foundation.

Its mandate was to provide funding and imagery to AIDS organisations by growing the audience and market for his artworks through exhibitions, publications and the licensing of his images.

Haring enlisted his imagery during the last years of his life, until his death on February 16 1990, to speak about his own illness and generate activism and awareness about AIDS.

Queen's Day, or Koninginnedag in Dutch, is a national holiday

Today the Dutch celebrate Queen Beatrix. Happy Queen's Day to the Netherlands!

Queen's Day, or Koninginnedag in Dutch, is a national holiday in the Netherlands, Curacao, Sint Maarten and Aruba. Before Queen's Day the Dutch celebrated 'Princess Day' on August 31st. The first celebration was in 1885, on the fifth anniversary of the then young Princess Wilhelmina, heiress to the Dutch throne. The initiative was taken by an editor of a local newspaper with the aim to emphasize national unity.



After the death of King Willem III in 1890, Princess Day was renamed as Queen's Day. When Queen Juliana accessioned the throne in 1948, the holiday moved to her birthday on the 30th of April. Her daughter, Beatrix retained the celebration on that day after she took the throne in 1980.





Queen's Day is well known for its nationwide flea market and its 'orange madness'. Many Dutch sell their secondhand items and dress up in orange - also to the colours of their flag: red, white and blue. Extensive outdoor parties are held in many cities. Especially Amsterdam is known for its festivities and attracts around half a million visitors. For many tourists Queen's Day is one of the main events of the year in Amsterdam.



Every year Queen Beatrix visits two towns in the Netherlands with as many members of the Royal Family as possible. In these places they are received by the local residents with special celebrations, which often take the form of demonstrations of traditional Dutch dances, crafts, sports and singing demonstrations.

How is Saint George celebrated in Catalonia?

Today is the feast day of Saint George.

Saint George is celebrated in several countries, regions and cities where he is the patron saint, including: England, Catalonia, Croatia, Cyprus, Greece, Moscow, Valencia, Majorca, Aragon, Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania.

23 April is traditionally accepted as the date of Saint George's death in AD 303.

In Catalonia, Saint George's Day is also know asLa Diada de Sant Jordi(The Day of the Book) orEl dia de la Rosa(The Day of the Rose).

The main events of this holiday include the exchange of gifts between couples, loved ones and colleagues – sharing similarities toValentine's Day.

Traditionally men give women roses, and women give men a book, symbolising 'a rose for love and a book forever'. However in modern times, the mutual exchange of books is also customary.





Roses have been associated with Saint George's Day since medieval times, while the giving of books is a recent tradition which started in 1923.

The tradition began to take off when a bookseller used the date to promote the holiday as a way to commemorate the nearly simultaneous deaths ofMiguel CervantesandWilliam Shakespeareon 23 April 1616.



This tradition and relationship between love and literacy evolved inBarcelona, the publishing capital of both the Catalan and Spanish languages.

Today on 23 April, across Catalonia the streets are filled with thousands of makeshift rose and book stalls – on average selling over 4 million roses and 800,000 books, which accounts for over half of the total yearly book sales in Catalonia.

This tradition has successfully spread outside of Catalonia, with UNESCO in 1995 adopting 23 April asWorld Book and Copyright Day.

For me, a picture should be like sparks. It must dazzle like the beauty of a woman or a poem. It must have radiance; it must be like those stones which Pyrenean shepherds use to light their pipes.Joan Miró



Today, 119 years ago, Joan Miró was born.

Miró was an internationally acclaimed Catalan painter, sculptor and ceramist. He has been a significant influence on late 20th century art, in particular American abstract expressionist artists such asRobert Motherwell,Alexander Calder,Arshile Gorky, andJackson Pollockhave found inspiration in his work.









Miró was the son of a gold smith and a cabinet maker, and he was trained at theEscuela de Bellas Artes de la Llotja, as well as theEscuela de Arte de Francesco Galí, Circulo Artístico de Sant Lluc.

Not many people know that he attended business school as well, and worked as a clerk in his teenage years. However, he abandonded the business world at an early age.

Miró was among the first artists to develop automatic drawing as a way to undo previous established techniques in painting, representing the beginning of Surrealism as an art movement.

Miró died in his home in Palma (Majorca) on December 25, 1983. A museum dedicated to his work, theFundació Joan Miró, was established in his birth city in 1975.

A Spanish patriot and neoclassical poet

Manuel José Quintanawas a Spanish patriot and neoclassical poet born on April 11th 1772 in Madrid.

He is one of the most important names in Spanish Literature during the transition from Enlightenment toRomanticism.

Quitana was at the forefront of liberal ideas in politics and advocated his ideologies through his work until his death in 1857.

He studied law at the University of Salamanca and served in the Napoleonic Wars, holding various political positions in the ‘Antibonapartista’ resistance, earning a reputation as an extreme patriot.

Quitana's most famous work is the first volume of hisVidas de Españoles célebres, containing lives of Spanish patriots, which stirred public imagination and secured Quintana the post of secretary to the Cortes during the French invasion.

Upon his return from the Napoleonic Wars, Quitana was imprisoned from 1814 to 1820.

Prior to the wars, in 1801 he wrote a tragedy,El Duque de Viseo, written with a patriotic theme.

His works during the Napoleonic Wars are highly regarded, consisting of many poems, pamphlets, and proclamations.

He wrote 34 poems, inspired by philanthropy and patriotism. The style is extremely rhetorical and is marked by political and liberal issues that have inspired many generations of Spaniards.

Ground-breaking photographer of motion

British photographerEadweard Muybridgewas born on April 9th 1830 in Kingston upon Thames, later emigrating the United States in the 1850s.



Portrat of Eadweard Muybridge, Wellcome Collection, CC BY

Muybridge is renowned for his ground-breaking work in animal locomotion, proving a horse does in fact fly when galloping. He was one of the first photographers to use multiple cameras to capture motion, then projecting the findings with his creation of the zoopraxiscope - a device for projecting motion pictures that pre-dated the flexible perforated film strip.

Muybridge’s most famous production experiment, which took place on June 19th, 1878. It was this experiment that laid the foundations for the future development of motion pictures, consisting of 24 photographs in a fast-motion series. Muybridge was commissioned by former Governor of California, Leland Stanford, a businessman and race-horse owner, who had taken a position on a popularly-debated question of the day: whether all four of a horse's hooves are off the ground at the same time during the trot, which was successfully proven by Muybridge’s experiment. As a result of the commission, Stanford published a bookThe Horse in Motion, but gave no credit to Muybridge despite containing his photos and his research, possibly because Muybridge lacked an established reputation in the scientific community.

Between 1883 and 1886 Muybridge took over 100,000 images at the Unversity of Pennsylvania, resulting in over 700 sequences, studying the movement of humans and animals.Many of these works can be found in Europeana, featuring models either entirely nude or with very little clothing, photographed in a variety of undertakings, ranging from boxing, to walking down stairs, to throwing water over one another and carrying buckets of water.

Today his findings and fundamentals are still used, with similar setups of carefully timed multiple cameras are used in modern special effects photography with the opposite goal: capturing changing camera angles with little or no movement of the subject. Muybridges’s work is also a major reference for technical artists and figurative drawing.

How large were the first Olympic Games?

What sports were in the first Olympics?

Who won medals at the 1896 Olympic Games?

Did women compete at the first Olympic Games?

What happened at the first modern Olympic Games in Athens in 1896?

The first modern Olympic Games were held in Athens, Greece in 1896. These games were very different from the modern event we now know. Let's look at the history of the 1896 Athens Olympics Games.

On 6 April 1896, King George I officially opened the Games of the First Olympiad. The date had been chosen to coincide with Easter Monday and the anniversary of Greece's independence.

As Ancient Greece was the birthplace of the Olympic Games, Athens was perceived to be an appropriate choice to stage the inaugural modern Games. It had been unanimously chosen as the host city during a congress in Paris on 23 June 1894.

An estimated 80,000 people crammed into the Panathenaic Stadium to celebrate the first modern Olympic Games - at the time, it was the largest crowd ever to watch a sporting event.

Despite many obstacles and setbacks, the 1896 Olympic Games were regarded as a great success.

The Games had the largest international participation of any sporting event to that date. 241 athletes from 14 different nations competed in 43 events in 9 sports, with the largest delegations coming fromGreece,Germany,FranceandGreat Britain.

Participants took part incycling, fencing, shooting, swimming andtennis. Sports such as athletics,gymnastics, weightlifting and wrestling took place in the Panathenaic Stadium, which had been rebuilt on the site of a stadium fromancient Greece.

By the end of the Games on 15 April, ten of the participating nations earned medals. The concept of national teams was not a major part of the Olympic movement until later, though sources list the nationality of competitors in 1896 and give medal counts.

The United States won the 11 gold medals, the most golds of any nation, while Greece won the most medals overall with 46.

Medals were awarded to all of those who participated in the Games, even if they did not achieve a place medal - recognising that taking part is as important as winning.

One of the most high-profile sports was the marathon race. It was won by Greek athlete, The marathon race was won by Spyridon Louis - he was the only Greek athlete to win a gold medal in athletics.

Women were not allowed to compete. However, on 11 April, the day after the men had ran the marathon race, a woman named Stamata Revithi ran the marathon course.

Although she was not allowed to enter the stadium at the end of her race, Revithi finished the marathon in about five hours and 30 minutes. Women were officially allowed to compete during the next games which took place inParis in 1900.

This story was updated in July 2024 with new images and more detailed history.

Jean-Honoré Fragonard was a French Rococo painter and printmaker, born on 5 April 51732 in Grasse in the south of France.

He trained in Paris withChardinand then laterBoucher.

Fragonard is considered as one of the all-time masters of French painting, with his unique handling of colour coupled with expressive and confident brush strokes, influencing the Impressionists that followed him.

Fragonard’s style embraces the freedom and curiosity that embodied the French Enlightenment, developing an exuberant and fluid manner as a painter, draftsman, and printmaker.

As one of the most prolific artists of his generation, Fragonard went on to produce more than 550 paintings, not to mention countless drawings and etchings which he rarely dated,many can be found in Europeana. His work is renowned for creating a sense of intimacy with an underlying eroticism.

Fragonard travelled often and created dreamy landscapes withHubert Robert, responding with a special sensitivity to the gardens of the Villa d'Este at Tivoli, elements of which occur in paintings throughout his career.

Some of his most famous works include them of Madame du Barry, Louis XV's most beautiful mistress, for whom he painted. These works are often regarded as his masterpieces.

Towards the end of Fragonard's life, the old social order was collapsing under the freedom of the press and the explosion of knowledge thanks to the Enlightenment.

As a result the French Revolution took shape, deeply affecting Fragonard and his private patrons, who were either guillotined or exiled. On top of this he failed to successfully adapt his style to the new neoclassical vogue, later becoming forgotten and ruined by the Revolution, dying in poverty.

Giacomo Casanova, Venetian adventurer and writer, was born on 2 April 1725 in the Republic of Venice.



During the 18th century for Casanova, as well as other upper class nobles, love and sex tended to be casual and not attached to the serious characteristics of the Romantic era that followed in the latter part of the 18th century.

Flirtations, bedroom games, and short-term liaisons were common among the rich who married for social connections rather than love.

I have always loved truth so passionately that I have often resorted to lying as a way of introducing it into the minds which were ignorant of its charms.Giacomo Casanova

As a renowned womaniser, his name remains a synonymous with the art of seduction. Despite this reputation, during his life Casanova was regarded as a well-respected figure, a man of far-ranging intellect and curiosity.

This is proven by the legacy of his works. His autobiographyHistorie de ma vie(Story of My Life) is now considered to be one of the most authentic references to the customs of social life in 18th century Europe.

The book is written in French, which at the time was the dominant language for the upper class of European society. The bowdlerised version of his memoirs can be found in Europeana entitledMémoires de Jacques Casanova(The Memoirs of Jacques Casanova) in 4 different volumes.



The uncensored version was purchased by theNational Library of Francein 2010, a 3,700 page manuscript, given to Casanova's nephew, Carlo Angiolini, in 1798 and featuring previously unread pages.These manuscripts can also be found in Europeana, covering Casanova's life from his birth to 1774.



‘Casanova’ was first recorded as a term in written English around 1852. It's now commonly used and documented in the English dictionary as 'a man with a reputation for having many amorous adventures; rake; Don Juan'.

The life story of Casanova continues to live on in modern culture, with numerous references in literature, film, and performing arts.

A brief and extraordinary artist's life

“Poetry surrounds us everywhere, but putting it on paper is, alas, not so easy as looking at it.” Vincent van Gogh

Dutch post-impressionist painter,Vincent van Goghwas born on 30th March 1853, in the town of Zundert in the south of the Netherlands. Vincent spent his early adulthood working for a firm of art dealers, travelling between The Hague, London and Paris, after which he taught for some time in England.

He is known for his vivid use of colour, however his early works, such as “The Potato Eaters” and “Skull of a skeleton with burning cigarette” in 1885, consisted of a limited palette, using mostly sombre earth tones. It was not until March of 1886 when he moved to Paris and then later to the south of France, where his style began to be influenced by French Impressionists and the strong sunlight found in southern Europe. Gradually his style evolved, with the use of striking colours and emotive brushstrokes, becoming unique and now eternally recognisable as the 'Van Gogh' style.

“I put my heart and my soul into my work, and have lost my mind in the process.” Vincent van Gogh

Despite his artistic abilities, Vincent suffered from anxiety and fits of mental illness. How and to what extent this influenced his work is largely unknown, but modern critics consider that Vincent was deeply unhappy because his sickness made his painting slower and less clear. Often his personal relationships were disatourus, instead turning to his art to express his love for humanity and exploration into man’s social and spiritual condition.

Before his tragic suicide at the age of 37, and in just over a decade, Vincent was very prolific, producing more than 2,100 artworks, consisting of 860 oil paintings and more than 1,300 watercolors, drawings, sketches and prints.

On July 29th 1890, Vincent was discovered dead and a letter was found on his body, addressed to his beloved brother Theo. Inhis penultimate letter, which can be found in Europeana, Vincent admitted "I have risked my life for my work, and it has cost me half my reason".

A pioneer of modern architecture

'Less is more'Ludwig Mies van der Rohe

Born in Germany on March 27th 1886,Ludwig Mies van der Roheis widely regarded as one of the pioneers of modern architecture, accelerating the post-war shift from classical ideologies of architectural design and construction methods.



His influential ‘skin and bones’ style, which is renowned for its understated clarity and simplicity is now evident in metropolises around the globe. His use of new age materials such as industrial steel and plate glass was revolutionary and paved the way for modern building methods, moving towards a minimal framework of structural order balanced against the implied freedom of free-flowing open space.

Although famous as an architect,Miesalso lent his hand to designing furniture, using modern industrial technologies. His work with furniture is known for its high-level of craftsmanship, with a balanced mix of traditional materials embellished with new age materials such as chrome and aluminium. Some of his most iconic furniture creations are the Barcelona chair and table, the Brnochair, and the Tugendhat chair.



While many regard the work ofMiesas architecture in its purest form, many counter-claim that his style strips architecture of all humanity, creating cold, sterile and unpractical environments. However, he may not have been the first architect to dabble with simplicity, but his ideals and rationalist view of minimalism has been carried through the 20th century, until today – the modern age.

Polaroid and the Instant Camera

What is your earliest memory of photography? For most of us it is probably the instant camera. A symbol of the democratisation of photography which started in the mid 20th century and laid the foundations for digital photography today.

The earliest instant camera, which consisted of a camera and portable darkroom in a single compartment, was invented in 1923 by Samuel Shlafrock. The instant camera as we know it today is accredited to American scientist,Edwin Land, invented for for the mass market in 1947 by Land’s company, now known as the Polaroid Corporation. Land was originally inspired and motivated to create an instant camera when he  took some photographs and his daughter asked, "Why can't I see them now?".

The great thing about the instant camera is its ability to generate a developed film directly within the camera, without the need for a darkroom – taking only a few seconds to process after clicking the shutter. Once the film was exposed and then processed, the film was pulled out of the back of the camera and would fully develop within a few minutes.

The real breakthrough came in the 1970s when Polaroid invented 'pack film'. This type of film was produced in a flat box containing a battery, which could then loaded into the camera under the lens, rather than into the back. Once the shutter was released, the film was exposed, developed, and then automatically ejected from the front of the camera. One of the many appeals of instant photography are the often quirky results of the film, producing unexpected effects, meaning the photographer was never quite sure how their photograph would turn out.

Instant cameras have found many uses throughout their history, becoming especially useful for passport photos, ultrasound photos, fashion shoots and other uses which required an instant photo. They were also used by police officers and fire investigators because of their ability to create an unalterable instant photo.

After the introduction of digital cameras and the comparative expense of instant film, in the 1990s instant photography fell out of fashion and continued with its decline through the early 2000s. But today, with the global popularity of smartphones and Instagram, instant photography has enjoyed a huge revival, from the growing niche of analogue photography to everyday digital picture making and sharing.

Land's original idea behind instant photography was to create a photographic system that was seamless and easy for anyone to use. This concept was ahead of its time and Land's philosophy lives on today through smartphones and digital cameras.Explore more content related to Polaroids and instant photography on Europeana.

An extraordinary musical talent

One of the most popular classical composers,Wolfgang Amadeus Mozartwas born inSalzburgon 27 January 1756. From an early age, Mozart showed great interest and extraordinary talent in music. Already at five, he started composing his first pieces, and impressed European royalty with his masterful keyboard play.



His father, Leopold, a musician and a minor composer, played a crucial role in Mozart’s musical development. He was the one who taught Mozart his first minuets, wrote down Mozart’s first compositions and gave up his career to dedicate himself fully to his son.

In 1762, the six-year-old Mozart together with his sister and his father started touring across Europe. Munich, Vienna, Prague, Mannheim, Paris, London… During these travels, Mozart met many musicians and composers, including Johann Sebastian Bach, and further mastered his skills.

After a short return to Salzburg, Mozart again travelled across Europe in search of better employment opportunities. He finally settled in Vienna in 1781, where a year later he marriedConstanze Weber.

Musically, Mozart’s life in Vienna was a period of outstanding creativity which saw the production of many of his best known symphonies, concertos and operas, and his finalRequiem.  Among the holdings of the National Library of Austria, you can find theoriginal manuspciptof this last great work, incomplete at his death in 1791.

Meet one of the 19th century's most influential artists

"There are no lines in nature, only areas of colour, one against another."Edouard Manet

One of the most influential artists of the 19th centuryEdouard Manetwas born on 23 January 1883 to a wealthy Parisian family with strong political connections. His father was a judge, and his mother was a daughter of a diplomat and a goddaughter of the Swedish crown prince.

Despite his father’s expectations, Manet did not pursue a career in law. Instead he studied art under the academic painterThomas Couture, and mastered his skills by copying masterpieces at the Louvre.

In 1856, Manet opened his own studio. However, his works did not bring him the deserved recognition. On the contrary, they were regarded by his contemporaries as controversial and repugnant.

Manet’s style of painting challenged the art conventions of that time. His most renowned paintings and Olympia caused a big public scandal. The flatness of the paintings, the sketch-like manner in which he handled the works as well as the underlying message that raised the issue of prostitution and the role of women were ridiculed by the art critics. However, they played a crucial role inspiring young artists who were later to become known as impressionists.

What happened to the Terra Nova Expedition?

One hundred years ago, on 17 January 1912, the Terra Nova Expedition - officially known as the British Antarctic Expedition 1910 - led by Captain Robert Falcon Scott reached the South Pole.

Unfortunately, the crew made it only to discover they were beaten by their Norwegian rival, Roald Amundsen, by 34 days and to meet their desolate death.



We shall stick it out to the end, but we are getting weaker of course and the end cannot be far. It seems a pity but I do not think I can write more. For God's sake look after our people.



Signed by Robert Falcon Scott, this was the last diary entry of the famous British explorer. On the return journey, all five members of the expedition die from starvation, exhaustion and cold.

What did Columbus see off the coast of Africa?

On 9 January 1493, Christopher Columbus observed something remarkable off the coast of Africa... mermaids.

In his journal, he described the encounter with three mermaids that elevated themselves above the suface of the sea. Most likely mistaking manatees, aquatic mammals also known as sea cows, for mermaids, "Columbus, disposed to give a wonderful character to everything in this New World, had identified these misshapen animals with the sirens of ancient story", explained historian Washington Irving.

Columbus also added that the mermaids were by no means as beautiful as depicted in folk tales. Indeed, mermaids have been traditionally known as creatures of divine beauty. Across the globe, from generation to generation, legends have been told about the mesmerising voices of mermaids that bewitched sailors to join the underwater world.

Here are some of the examples of how mermaids have been depicted in different countries:

This autumn, the collections on Europeana has reached 20 million items, increasing the content ten-fold since its initial launch in 2008.

The 20 millionth item is apainting of the Biblical story of David and Goliathpainted by the celebratedCaravaggioin 1600-1601.

Caravaggio worked predominantly on Christian themes, linking the sacred and the profane by giving his Biblical characters a raw authenticity and physical presence.

This painting of David and Goliath was a number of Carravagio's artworks depicting these subjects - others are part of the collections inthe  Galleria Borghese in Rome, Italy and in the Prado in Madrid, Spain.

David with the head of Goliathis part of the collections of the Fine Art Museum in Vienna, andprovided to Europeana by Kulturpool, the organisation that brings digitised cultural hertage fromAustriainto Europeana. Its recently added collections also include various artefacts from ancient Egypt, ranging from toiletry items to kitchen utensils.

Who was the painter who made the Girl with a Pearl Earring?

Johannes Vermeer'spaintingGirl with a pearl earring_has been among the world's most famous artworks.

It’s hard to believe that, for two centuries, the painting was barely mentioned in any of writing on 17th-century Dutch painting. His art was rediscovered only in the 19th century, after Gustav Friedrich Waagen and Théophile Thoré-Bürger published an essay attributing 66 paintings to him (although only 36 paintings are attributed to him now).

View of Delft, Johannes Vermeer, Mauritshuis, Public Domain

Besides scarce facts, including that he was baptised in Delft on 31 October 1632, very little is known about Vermeer.

It is unclear where and with whom Vermeer apprenticed as a painter. For many years, it was believed that Vermeer's master was Leonaert Bramer of Delft. However, Bramer's style was so different from both early and subsequent works of Vermeer, that it was difficult to draw any definite conclusions.

La Dentelliere, Johannes Vermeer, Musée du Louvre, In copyright

The role his father played in Vermeer’s artistic development is yet indisputable. Reynier Janszoon was acaffawercker(worker of silk and caffa) and an art dealer.

'If, as I believe, Vermeer created patterns of his own in some of the rugs, tapestries, and leather wall coverings that he depicted, both the impulse and the skill may perhaps be traced to his exposure to his father's craft', writes Professor John M. Montias, the author ofVermeer and His Milieu: A Web of Social History.

The paintings his father dealt with were also a likely source of inspiration for young Vermeer.

The masterful use of light and colour as well as the carefully created compositions can be best seen in his works from the late 1650s, the period of Vermeer’s artistic maturity. This is also the period of relative financial stability, secured by Vermeer’s mother-in-law, who had also indirectly influenced Vermeer’s work, and Pieter van Ruijven, an important Delft citizen who became Vermeer’s patron.



Although highly regarded by his peers, Vermeer's fame did not spread far outside Delft. This could be because he produced a relatively small amount of works, most of which were in the hands of only a few select collectors.

Vermeer had many other responsibilities: a father of 14 children, head of an artists’ guild, art dealer and an inn-keeper, which could explain why he might not had the time to devote himself fully to painting.

Anne Frank's Diary is a symbol of the suffering of Jewish people during the Holocaust and World War II.

Anne Frank is considered one of the most important figures of the 20th century, a symbol of the suffering of Jewish people during the Holocaust. Her diary, published posthumously as “The Diary of a Young Girl”, is one of the world’s most read books.

The first entry in her diary, the red-and-white-checkered notebook she got for her 13th birthday, was:

I hope I shall be able to confide in you completely, as I have never been able to do in anyone before, and I hope that you will be a great support and comfort to me.

In the diary, along with personal reflections, thoughts and dreams, Anne Frank captures the grave tragedies inflicted by the madness of the Nazi regime and World War II.

She documents the two years the Frank family spends in a secret attic hiding from the Nazis.

On Christmas Eve 1943, she writes:

I long to ride a bike, dance, whistle, look at the world, feel young and know that I'm free, and yet I can't let it show. Just imagine what would happen if all eight of us were to feel sorry for ourselves or walk around with the discontent clearly visible on our faces. Where would that get us?

On August 1, 1944, Anna makes her last entry, where she writes about the continuous struggle between her contradictory inner selves.

No one knows Anne’s better side, and that’s why most people can’t stand me. Oh, I can be an amusing clown for an afternoon, but after that, everyone’s had enough of me to last a month. Actually, I’m what a romantic movie is to a profound thinker — a mere diversion…

A few days later, Anne and her family are discovered in their hiding place by the security police. This is followed by their arrest, interrogation and deportation to the Auschwitz concentration camp, where Anne dies from typhus aged fifteen.

The diary's popularity inspired a 1955 play by screenwriters Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett, which has been performed across Europe.

Turku Castle

Toompea Castle

Exploring two castles in Tallinn and Turku, the European Capitals of Culture 2011

Since 1985, the European Union has dedicated a calendar year to theEuropean Capital of Culture, a European city or cities to promote Europe’s immense cultural assets.

Previous European Capitals of Culture include Athens (1985), Lisbon (1994), Graz (2003), Sibiu (2007) and Istanbul (2010.)

In 2011, the European Capitals of Culture are Turku and Tallinn, two important medieval trade ports. Let's take a look at their histories through their medieval castles.

Important trade cities always attracted all sorts of threats making defensive structures necessary. Tallinn and Turku were no exception: Turku castle and Toompea castle in Tallinn were built to withstand possible outside (and inside) aggressions.

The first bricks of the Turku castle were laid in late 13th century, when Finland was part of Sweden. It was built primarily as the city's main defensive structure to secure naval traffic from present-day Sweden (especially Stockholm) and to oversee the Aura river.

Its importance as a defence of the city was luckily only tested once - in 1318, Russians from Novgorod destroyed Turku.

The castle saw many uses. It was a stronghold for the rivals of the king of Sweden to acting as an administrative centre for western Finland. In 1987, renovations of the castle were completed and it now serves as the Turku provincial museum.

Toompea castle was built slightly earlier than Turku Castle, having been in use since at least the 9th century.

It started out as a wooden fortress but was gradually built in a more solid way. The majority of the present-day castle was erected in late 11th and 12th centuries.

The castle consists of three parts, built on Toompea hill (from the German 'Domberg', literally meaning 'dome hill') in the centre of Tallinn. The hill takes its name from the Dome Church which is also located there.

During its colourful history, the castle has been occupied not only by Estonians (or the people of the ancient North-Estonian county Revala) but also by Danes, Swedes and Russians.

Today, Toompea Castle serves as the home of theRiigikogu, the Estonian parliament.

"Mein Glück, mein ganzes Glück, Ostern werde ich noch fern sein, aber das zweite Frühlingsfest – Pfingsten – wird nicht kommen ohne dass wir uns wieder nahe gewesen sind."

My happiness, all my happiness, Easter I will still be far away, but the second Spring festival - Whitsunday - will not come without us being close once more.

This is what Reinhold Sieglerschmidt wrote to his wife in his diary on 20 April 1916, just before Easter that year. Reinhold was then on the Eastern Front near Dünaburg (Daugavpils, Latvia).

Throughout World War I, he kept a diary, in which he wrote to his beloved wife, Helene. Reinhold was killed on the Western Front in February 1918, leaving Helene with their three children.
